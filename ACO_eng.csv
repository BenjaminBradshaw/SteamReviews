All-in-all I believe this game is a MUST HAVE in your library; even if you've never played any other of the AC games. Honestly it was incredibly immersive! If you have a gaming headset, you can forget the reality around you. This game transports you so hard into it's environment. I've put in roughly 74 hours in and I completed the main storyline and I've killed all the cultists. BUT! I still have tons of unexplored territory and most likely a ton more side missions to complete. There's so much replay value in this game and I know I only purchased the Standard Version, but I am going to be getting the season pass for it as well. Oh and for those of you complaining about the In-Game purchases ... They are optional! Not buying them does not put you at a disadvantage nor does purchasing them give you much of an advantage. They are mostly cosmetic aside from the armor sets and weapons. (buy them if you like their perks and want them for a particular build). I also loved the fact you could choose to play as either [b]Alexios[/b] or [b]Kassandra[/b]. I opted for [b]Kassandra[/b] because the main protagonist outside of the animus is [b]Leyla[/b] so it provided more fluidity and continuity for me. It just made more sense.

Personally I say yes, I recommend the game if you overlook grinding and mircrotransactions (and Alexio's not-so-good voice acting). For a player such as myself I appreciate immersing in the environment and to experience actual time frames of a certain task if you really want to think about the real world, as things like gathering and leveling does make a character more skilled. The thing is, while there are side quests that can admittedly be boring in some aspects, the wider, more unique stories to these things makes up for it. Instead of making you think its repetetive, they are rewarding in their own right. 
I have spent hours in Skyrim, and you have to be honest that their quests is talk, go there, come back, so you and I can definitely tell if something is repetetive, or otherwise so interesting you don't mind. Odyssey just, makes me very happy. Compared to games that is a pain to grind and feel like a chore, this one is good enough for me.

The story is amazing. Call me a sensitive lil one, but there was an aspect in the game that got me teary.

Let's take the bad things first, although these are probably more individual 

First off, this isn't Assassin's Creed. Mostly because they've turned it much more into an RPG focused game. You now do damage not only based on your weapons, but also based on abilities and skills you pick in three seperate skill trees: Hunter(ranged bow), Fighter(Melee combat) and Assassin(Stealth attacks). Now this on it's own isn''t a problem. Quite the contrary to be honest. It gives you a much more free way to adjust the missions and combat to your style. You don't have to be a stealthy assassin or a melee god. You can pick everyone off from far away. That said it's IMO the execution of the latter that is an issue. If specing on the Assassin tree had given you more stealth, diversion tactics etc. it would have been good. However it is also focused on abilities that do damage. Assassination damage. YOU CAN NO LONGER INSTAKILL ENEMIES THAT YOU ASSASSINATE! You'll be able to take down most lower tier units, but high value units like camp leaders won't be instakilled unless you spec for it. Even then you may not be able to one shot them. You can''t even kill them properly if they're sleeping! Yes. A game called Assassin's creed where you're an assassin makes you unable to slit someone's throat in their sleep. This is something that causes huge frustration for me and I hope they don't' venture down this path further. 

The second reason I no longer feel this is an AC game is because you don''t have to do stealth at all. Sure, barging in ""guns blazing"" will give you more enemies to kill, however it doesn't cause you to fail a mission or anything. According to some it might actually be less time consuming than sneaking around and picking people off one by one. To me this is also an issue for a game that carries this name. 

However, this is still a good game. It's a good open world RPG game that has a good story line and all you want. The crafting is still there, however you're not forced to go into a remote area of the map to hunt down three animals that only spawn two at a time every 60 hours of game time. You have side quests, exploration, military camps, battles, sailing and so on. I would still recommend this game because it is a really good game. It's just not an AC game anymore.",True,1541375444,1541375444,True,0,0,0,False

Really trying to like this game, and i did go into it not expecting anything resembling assassin's creed.
Let's face it, it's not assassin's creed and that's alright, we should be able to live with that.

I went into it expecting a proper RPG, maybe something like the witcher but less good.

Now it really is less good, but the forced RPG aspect in this game is making me cringe.
Although it is cool that i have to be careful when picking on higher leveled opononents; it doesn't make sense most of the time.

A backstab is a backstab and even when the enemy doesn't have more armor than their lower leveled counterpart; they'll magically survive it.
I like stealth and so far i'm trying to thin out the numbers before i go into combat, if at all.
Just now i whistled a guy into a bush and assassinated him.
Except i didn't.
I stabbed him in the thigh and he had 20% of his hp left, maybe i'm missing something but there's no way of knowing this until you're close enough to hit F and go for the assassination; that's when his healthbar will show up.

The difficulty overall just feels bad.
The game is way too easy when you're actually fighting people of your level, except when you jump into a complete horde of them and start whacking around but that's to be expected.
The way the game seems to compensate for dumb and pretendable AI is by just throwing up the levels and making sure you have to grind before you can continue.
I don't see grinding as a fun challenge.

I was pretty much prepared for lacking gameplay elements since it's a completely new direction, but i did at the very least expect a good story or characters.

IF you start this game, pick the female character.
I don't know if she's well acted but playing as the male protagonist will give you cringy, unfunny and rather generic lines from the start.

Also i don't know if they're trying to market this to kids or something but the humor is just so forced and unfunny.
Then again i don't think they're marketing it to kids and their writing is just bad, because i saw a guy get a spear go through his mouth and the back of his throat.
(That was pretty cool and got my hopes up).

All in all maybe i'm too harsh on this game but i bought a more expensive version for like 90 bucks hoping to at least get all the content and i regret it horribly.
A game like this should be about 40 bucks tops.
Unfair comparison but if you're lucky enough to have a ps4 and a copy of red dead redemption 2, you'll be nothing but disappointed with this title and it's lack of many things.

I'm going to continue playing until i atleast get some cool looking spartan gear, because that's my only goal and reason to keep playing so far. 
I'll update the review when i'm there but i feel like i've already seen most of which the game has to offer, i'm probably now going into the repetetive open world rinse and repeat cycle Ubisoft is so fond of lately.

0,1395,34,7146,3460,76561198013812373,0,english,False,45631270,"Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is certainly one of the best games of the series. I'd rate it second only after Assassin's Creed 2 (a game that managed to combine such a great story with awesome gameplay, characters and setting). Although honestly, these two games cannot even be compared anymore. AC: Odyssey (and Origins before it) steered away so much from the basic gameplay that it's almost entirely a different game. Which is good, I guess. I for one am really looking forward to what the future holds for the franchise. 

Gameplay now focuses heavily on roleplaying elements, a trend that I still not sure what to think of: in 'just' 30 hours of playing I'd collected and upgraded all the skills I'd focus on for the rest of the game. I would have prefered some skills to upgrade basic stuff like damage or health instead of just spending skillpoints on skills I'd never use. That took away a bit of the joy of leveling. The one thing that stands in this regard is how it is almost impossible to one-hit stealth kill tougher enemies (even basic ones) without using specific skills. It's just one of those elements of the RPG approach that feels a bit fiddly and shallow.

Having said that, I did really enjoy exploring Greece. It is SO vast, it has to be experienced to be believed. I ended up exploring all of it. Every single sidequest, every location, every island, I just couldn't rest before I'd finished it all. There is so much content that you can easily spend over a hundred hours and still not see all of it. The story was enjoyable as well, I loved the structure of the Odyssey quests, which have you fighting some truly spectacular opponents that proves how the series is changing. The inspiration of games like Skyrim and the Witcher is clearly visible throughout the game. Too bad there is not even 1 hour worth of modern day story here. I always really enjoyed those scenes and the ones here could have easily been left out without the game losing any of its' agency. 

Overall, I was happy to finish it (and let go of my OCD completionist tendencies) but most of the time I spent in Greece was just glorious. Recommended! 8/10",False,1541372285,1541372285,True,0,1,0.540145933628082275,False

Extremely fun, the mythilogical aspects of the game are woven into the story very well and I really want to see more of it. 

That being said, winning battles for either side grants a few rewards, but the consequences of the battles don't seem to effect anything, other than what banners fly in the keeps, there is no real incentive to continue after the gear has no benfit. 

A co-op mode for this game would dramatically improve the experience, playing with a friend in a game such as this would be spectacular.

Around 33 hours on the Alexios campaign, I decided to start over and play as Kassandra...  Best choice EVER. It seems the game was designed with Kassandra in mind and then added Alexios later down the line. The performances with the narrative work best with Kassandra. The captures and voice were just better with her than her male counterpart.

To be frank, this isn't a traditional Assassin's Creed game. Sure some of the tropes from the series are in full force, but you can see the changes inspired by games like the Witcher 3 and the applied learnings from Last years Origins. it's a bold jump in a new direction but in some cases it feels like it's lost it's charm. if feels more of an emulation of a hybrid game of the aforementioned....  BUT the game really comes together when you get bast the overall narrative and focus on the exporation. This game really SHINES in this. you can use the guided narrative of the previous games or GO all out. NO hints no markers and you explore the world as you see fit. It's really a marvel of work and efforts by the various teams.

If the teams release this as a single assassin, Kassandra, and focused on building the world and how she reacts and lives in it... it would have been a better game. the addition of Alexious hurts the narrative a bit... Exploring Greece is just amazing. you can see the progress from last years game to this years release. I'm not a fan of the micro transactions... but they are not needed. I have yet to purchase anything beyond the season pass. With no spoilers...  I love what the have done with the mondern day segments in this game. (want more see for yourself).

I'm looking forward to the new content, first hidden Dagger and Atlantis. I just completed Atlantis and had no idea I was working on that part of the narrative until it happend. :)

Overall.. this is a solid step in a new direction and I look forward to seeing what they cook up for the next entry. BUT.... stick to one protagonist.... having multiple hurts the flow unless they do the Frye Twins again. It's a beautiful game, the engines work better than expected and some of the glitches are more fun and jokey then game breaking. it's an adventure you should try for yourself.

0,328,3,5237,2213,76561198047969430,0,english,False,45621383,"A nice game, but one that has many shortcomings.

I enjoyed Odyssey. I haven't 100%'d it yet, but I did all the ""main/side"" stuff. (Yet to do boring shit like all underwater locations etc.) The game is gorgeous, and Kassandra is a snarky piece of shit that it's hard not to fall in love with. Playing through the game in Nightmare, I wholy recommend to go full skyrim and play - you guessed it right - a stealth archer. Just remember to set a trap at the bonfire if you're not confident you can do everything unseen. Even though you CAN play melee - especially if you've crafted the immortal bonus on one of your gear parts - and Kassandra (/Alexios I guess, but do yourself a favour and play Kassandra, the voiceover is so much better) does control very smoothly, you can't get one-combo-killed if they never see you :p
(Notable exception for the Spartan kick. Best ability in the game.)

I did the whole playthrough without a single microtransaction outside of the horse skin from ubi club (but you basically get that one for free :p), that I replaced later on anyway. MTXs in this game are mostly, to me, ways to gain some time or to look cool-ish (I personally loved the look/stats of my in-game sets, but to each their own.), and still got to have a ludicrous amount of extra resources that I could do nothing with.

The story definitely had its ups and downs. Some areas had me really wanting to know more about wtf was happening, some I had to treat as just stuff I had to do to progress further because they were kinda boring-ish. The finale was a letdown in many ways, both in terms of combat (if you're min-maxed, you'll destroy the final boss in around 4 shots, even in Nightmare ; probably less in lower difficulties) and in terms of choices/dialog options. The Ghost wasn't even a surprise either, if you had bothered to look at the clues first.

My biggest gripe - and it's not enough to make me give the game a negative - was the difficulty curve. Again, keep in minde that I was playing in Nightmare.
So basically, at the beginning of the game, you have to do stuff perfectly, and dodge forever. The ""Cyclops"" took me literal minutes to bring down, because it felt like I was doing no damage whatsoever (I guess I should have skilled the spartan kick, but that's hindsight 10/10). The first beast of artemis was a fucking chore.
In the midgame, everything felt pretty nice ; could reliably assassinate the small guys, and significantly chunk the big ones so that it didn't take me forever to finish them with poison or fire attacks.
Once I hit spear level 5 however, and had predator shot + achille's bow, I could basically oneshoot anything I wanted. It does take a bit of grind to get there, but still...

Also, in the early/midgame, it was nearly required to sometimes respec the ability trees for some specific fights (the pig is another example of that). In lategame, between the level 50 and all the stele points, you basically have all the interesting points anyway (and can't even fit everything in the wheel).

So sadly enough, once I had the full master artemis set & achille's bow (and, maybe importantly, the falx of olympos), I could oneshoot small guys with normal arrows, and oneshoot big guys with devastating shot. Which is... kind of anticlimatic. Removes most of the fear of being seen - because if you can oneshoot the guy seeing you before he can alert anyone else, it's not exactly fun.

Last gripe would be with the ressources ; once you've done everything, there's no ""ressource sink"". Once you've fully upgraded the adrestia and have your most used sets / weapons at lvl 50, there's nothing to further use your ressources  - that you keep generating because assassinations auto-loot so you get a bunch of drachmae (if you sell) / mats (if you break).

But beyond all of that, I'm a sucker for open worlds, and I like exploring, so the world of Odyssey is rich enough that I don't mind the iffy difficulty curve - because let's be real, that's not what the game is about.

If you're a wanderer looking to kill stuff, fuck people of both genders, while sitting back in your chair without needing to pay too much attention to the story, then that game is for you. If you're a completionist who likes to look in every cove for that hidden chest, this game is for you.

If you want intricate storytelling on the level of Erikson's MBotF, or the Witcher, etc, then this game is probably not for you. If you want Souls-like level of combat, this isn't for you.
If you can't accept your MC wanting to fuck everything that moves, well, uh, you'll have to close your eyes a lot.
If you're that dude who thought the ancient greeks were christians, you proooobably could use the history lesson

I'm new to AC series, because I play only story-oriented games _with choices_ (and for females only most of the time) so this was the first AC game in the series which caught my interest. I was pleased by the result, it is a very good game, one of the best I played recently but - not perfect.

The (really) good:

- Combat. This is almost shocking for me to say since I actually don't like (action) combats in rpg games. I play them for story and (ideally moral) choices. But... in ACO the combat was so enjoyable I actually spent immense amount of time just fighting for fun. The stealth + archery aspect added to the classical melee option allows so wide (and to a point tactical even) possibilities how to ""kill someone"" it was really a great fun to do. And on top of it - a really awesome and ruthless fatalities made me indeed feel like a god(dess). An _incredible_ kickass. It was... just pleasant to watch how “deadly and merciless” I am (though more about that later in a bit less positive sense too).

- Naval battles. Essentially the same as above. They were fun, gorgeously made and a very nice addition to the regular combat.

- Often meaningful choices, pretty and plentiful cinematic cut-scenes. Perhaps not as detailed as in Witcher3 but there are not many games which have this better. Surely a lot better than what Bioware was providing after their switch to Frostbite engine.

- Graphics, world and things to do. It is Incredibly detailed with always something to do or discover. Enjoyable to be in with constant desire to improve your character, ship or just the knowledge of the world.

- An option to play female (and female only) main protagonist. Well... finally I'd say.

- Scale. As many said already, the game is indeed massive. Ensuring hundreds of hours to play if you want to complete everything. And... despite being massive it does not feel overly generic or repetitve. There's always some side quest somewhere to involve you and keep interested.

---

The not so nice but no big issue things:

- At first I was afraid this will be in fact an unplayable p2w (on top of already an expensive game) but as you progress in levels those materials/gold for rl money they offer become (thank gods!) completely irrelevant as they can be indeed very quickly collected by simply playing the game. Still - I consider selling ""cheats"" for money (and consequently banning _personal cheats_ in EULA for a _single-player_ game where it is no one's business what I do _at my home on my PC_ to enjoy something _without harming_ anyone :-P) a totally _unacceptable_ practice.

- Erotic - or to be more exact - the _total_ lack of it. I don’t get this. I really don’t. Kassandra lies, steals, even talks about sex with no reservations. She _murders_ innocent people, by stabbing them from the back, shooting in the head by arrows, blood spilling _everywhere_. And yet... No. Sorry. We cannot let you see a single damn breast in any love-scene, yet alone something more. I don’t get this, really. When the world will start to treat games at least as movies are? I don’t ask for porn, but I ask for erotic when it fits, just like brutality (when it fits). More mature people play (this kind of) games today than watch movies in fact. So... hallo? Wake up already?

- Always on by default “community photos” They are just hassle. I don’t play _single player games_ to “socialize” with someone and I surely do not care about his or her silly screenshots. As I’m 100% sure they do not care about mine. And if I do... I can always go the the appropriate forums/fan pages on the web for that. :-P

- I'm not really a fan of mixing fantasy with sci-fi and the real world. It gives me a sore feeling in my mouth. Fortunately those ""sci-fi"" things are so tiny and non-invasive I could safely just ignore them.

- The need to switch quick bars ignoring the fact keyboard has no gamepad-like limitations in the amount of buttons available felt just like an annoyance of the console port, nothing else.

- The game ""steals"" some ideas from Witcher3 so blatantly it's almost shameful. But it is not necessarily a bad thing of course as W3 was an excellent game indeed . However... it never goes to the lengths and detail Witcher3 side-quests did. ACO quests - while nicely done - rarely have some unexpected ""twist"" in them unlike to W3 where it was ""oh so wonderfully"" common thing, always letting you wonder “what will in fact happen”.

- I really somewhat missed the game does not offer me to truly pick sides. Both Sparta and Athens treat me like a mercenary and that’s it, no matter what I do. They don’t get friendlier or more antagonistic towards me if I’d let say prefer one of them in battles and missions. Perhaps you can choose something at the end (I still didn't finish the game yet), but for the majority of the game you're indeed just a - sellsword.

- Only 20 savegame slots. Why? Limit cloud if you want to, but why do you limit us how many saves we can have on our hard-drives?

---

The bad:

- To me the _by far the biggest_ thing I disliked was... well... The _total inconsistency_ in Kassandra’s personality. I in fact enjoy playing villains. And Kassandra truly is one, the game basically forces you to be if you want to succeed. No flag, no loyalties, incredible stream of totally cold-blooded murders, robberies, stealing. It’s perhaps even too much sometimes, not because I’d want to set some “moral limits” here (I’m far from that) but simply because it goes beyond just “evil” to plain “insane”. 

However that would be still ok if only... If only in many cut-scenes she then didn’t start to panic and cry like a little baby just because “something bad happened”. It feels so “out of her character” in comparison to the actual gameplay! She’s hard-boiled, ruthless murderer for gods’ sake! So at least let us act her like that in those sad cut scenes too (with a choice)! And not as some total hypocrite (at best) - or schizophrenic madwoman - at worst. You cannot make assassin and a flagless mercenary a “truly good guy” and keep it “believable”. They’re what they are. At best they can have some heart deep inside somewhere but that’s about it.

- Romances. Alas, they don’t go beyond the decades old now “Bioware approach” - Click on the heart sign and eventually the sex will fall out. :-( Also... what I perhaps dislike even more... You cannot make some “game lasting” bond. Once you accomplish that “amazing black screen” with someone (see above about (no) sex in this game in general :-P), at best you can recruit “your love” to the ship and that’s it. No aftermath, no care, no common further scenes and surely no jealousy towards your possible affairs later. It is just “glued to the game” like in most of the games which so blatantly boast having “romances” and ""true relationships"".  While in fact it has no depth at all, it’s just porn (without that porn aspect even). Disappointing and sloppy, nothing to praise for except perhaps that you at least _can_ kiss someone.

This is a solid game, and despite what I'm going to critisize, it's a pretty impressive accomplishment.

If you have played AC: Origins, you've more or less played AC:  Odyssey. It's hard to not see the similarities, and that's fine since they are based on the same engine, assets, etc, and only came out a year a part. That said, I strongly feel that Origins is a more cohesive game that accomplishes what it sets out to do in a better manner.

Odyssey starts off VERY strongly. The introduction to the story and protagonist is great, and when it immediately dumps you into the utterly MASSIVE world of ancient greece, you definitely get the feeling that this game is something special, and monumental in size. Then, you start to play it.

The plot is broken into chapters, and as you go it  branches off into 4 separate sub-stories, all 4 of which are part of the ""main story"", and can be accomplished sort of as you'd like. 

The world of ancient greece is huge, but compared to the distinctly varied areas of Origins, most of the map feels strikingly similar. Indeed the main story will bring you to the most interesting places early on. Athens, the game's largest city is pretty, but nowhere near as impressive as Alexandria was in Origins, which is probably historically accurate but still underwhelming (The Acropolis and Pantheon is cool though). There are dozens of relatively large cities in this game, but almost none of them are memorable or different in any way. Each city will have a leaders house, a couple temples, some restricted warehouse type building, etc. 

This is where the game starts to struggle for me. There seems to be less and less point to explore as the game progresses. Worst of all, the level cap at 50 is a hard cap. In Origins, you would continue to accrue XP and could overlevel, and earn new points and slowly increase your stat cap by 1% at a time if you wished, which allowed you to grow even stronger. In Odyssey, you're done at level 50. While it takes a long time to get there, I still had over half the world unexplored. When you're max level and already have legendary gear, whats the point of clearing out more ruins, more camps, etc?

As a completionist, the last third of the game for me was slogging through the map to unlock the achievements. Thankfully there is no ""Do everything"" achievement like Origins, because without getting any reward for doing so, it would be miserable.

Gear leveling is absurdly expensive and makes you wonder why you would even bother upgrading a weapon you like. High level upgrades cost like up to around 1000 leather. For hindsite, killing a goat at max level gives you like 7 leather. You end up raiding a billion camps and looting chests to get hundreds of armors that are worse than your legendary gear that you just break down for leather over and over and over again. The gear system is busted, and the only thing that makes it interesting is the unlockable engraving system.

The rewards for exploring the open world are disappointing. While it starts strong, pretty soon I found myself only interested in syncronization points for fast travel / Ikaros upgrades, and ruins for ancient tablets (For Adrestia upgrades). If you're the type that wants to check every ? mark, you will be disappointed in how this ends. For those that don't care and want to find things as they run into it, you will probably enjoy it more.

Some of the story is pretty interesting, although their attempt at making a Witcher / Mass Effect style RPG system with dialogue is kinda weird, because Alexios  / Kassandra has no morality points, and the dialogue you choose can be all over the place, making it seem like your character is emotionally unstable at times.

Hunting the Cult of Kosmos is probably one of the strongest points of the game, in the vein of the old Mercenaries' Deck of 52. Sometimes youll stumble upon a cult leader, sometimes youll follow the clues to kill them. The flavor text is fun and the rewards are cool, although as previously mentioned once you have legendary armor youre probably not going to want any of the other stuff in the game.

The Mercenary system is a huge bummer. What starts off looking like a Shadow of Mordor style leader system turns into a pretty boring wack-a-mole. They recently buffed the Merc tier rewards to increase your incentive to actually care about your rank, for other than the achievement, but its pretty forgettable.

The combat and ability system is probably my biggest complaint about this game. You're forced to only have FOUR abilities to use in battle at a time (and 4 for your bow separately), until you unlock a second ability wheel, where you can have a total of eight... Spoiler, there is way more than 8 abilities you may want to use in battle. It's really unfortunate that you can only bind up to 8 of them, because whats the point in unlocking other cool abilities? Sure, you can rebind them and respec for practically free, but thats such an obtuse way to let the player experiment with abilities. Origins managed to figure out how to have a bunch of abilities work at the same time, this feels like a step back.

I played on Nightmare for most of the game, which seemed all over the place in terms of difficulty. It's absurdly hard, for most of the game you will die in 1-2 hits, forcing you to play smart, avoid direct combat, spec in assassination, use poison for debuffs, etc. It's actually very rewarding and fun. Then you get to bullshit like the legendary animals, which clearly were not play tested on Nightmare, and you want to tear your hair out since youll die far more to a fucking boar or big wolf than you did to any Dark Souls boss. There are a bunch of abilities and engravings that seem crucial to help you in Nightmare mode that you dont unlock until late game, which is a bummer. Once I reached level 50 and the enemies were still fucking me up in 2-3 hits, I bumped it down to hard so I could at least feel like I accomplished something.

Overall, AC:Odyssey seems like 1 step forward and 2 steps back. The setting is fun, the main protagonist is cool but maybe not as memorable as Bayek was. I don't think the player agency RPG mechanics for dialogue really accomplish much. This is still a big must-buy for any AC fan, the lore established (if you give a shit about the animus real world stuff) is interesting, although there isn't a whole bunch of it. There is a cool reveal at the very end that felt like a nice payoff. The loot mechanics still don't feel meaningful, even with the additions from origins, and the open world is maybe too big for its own good. This game also will not respect your time whatsoever, you will lose a hundred hours easily trying to do most of the main stuff.

As far as the grind claims - Hitting level 33 now and not feeling any of the grind-walls described, nor do I feel any of the bugs. Not seeing a need for DLC or MTX to make the game fun, so not sure what these kids are complaininag about. With that being said, I am so damned impressed with the execution fo this game and how much fun it has been, that I am going to do something I rarely do and actually buy DLC and MTX to support the game even further.

I agree that the leveling system is a little wacky, but Odyssey's other ventures overwhelming outweigh its downfalls. It was a surprisingly fun game to play and it has me reinterested in playing the AC franchise (which was dying anyway).

Story quests, mixed with side quests, awesome character interactions, and some classic cut scenes haha. Granted, some of the voice acting could be a bit better, but aside from that, this release is a must for anyone even remotely into the series.

Unfortunately, the game starts to show cracks in the second act. With it's open world approach, Odyssey's mainline quests are locked behind level caps and far too much of the secondary quests end up serving as filler to reach the next content cap. Only the Alkabiades/Sokrates chain in Athens has any real substance... and they're pretty much the same old fetch quests.

 Combat wise it's no better, opponents become more and more DPS sponges the further past level 35 you go, the ability tree increasingly can't add anything like enough variety to make up for the chore the fights become by level 40, 

Finally, the plot falls apart completely in the last act, with infuriating plot shields and contrived senarios being thrown at you more and more as you progress. The amount of stupid pills Alexios/Kassandra have to eat in act three to get the story from A to B breaks any immersion you might have felt up to then.

I'd like to kick things off by addressing a common ""problem"" people have with this game, and that is that it is ""grindy"" and that it was done on purpose to encourage microtransactions. This is completly false. Most of those reviews are from people who are confusing the procedurally generated quests with the actual side quests.

That's right, there are three types of quests in this game: Main quests, side quests, and procedurally generated quests. The procedurally generated quests were essentially borrowed from Skyrim. For anyone who had played Skyrim, you'll recall that after completing all main and side quests, what remained was a bunch of quests that were randomly generated. These quests were grindy and involved fetching items, slaying X number of bandits, etc. They were there just to give the player something to do and make the game feel like it goes on forever. It's the SAME story here. That's what those quests are, but in this game it is VERY easy to tell which quests those are. They are the BLACK icons on the map, not to be confused with the GOLD ones with exclaimation points inside them. Those are the side quests.

What's the difference? The side quests are all very good. In general they aren't grindy. Yes, you are still doing X thing, or killing Y person, but it is completely story driven. You have a reason to want to kill Mr. or Mrs. X. It is very similar to the Witcher 3. The side quests there were compelling because of the acting, yet you were still fetching X or killing Y. It's the same here. You are often given choices within these side quests as well, and they can affect other aspects of the game later on. The variation in quest types is great as well. Some quests are to kill someone who is harassing entire villages, which involves finding clues and hunting him/her down. Other quests involve a free for all death match. Yet others involve getting hustled by a smart-mouth child and figuring out how you want to handle such a situation. Above all, some of the side quests were VERY funny and on more than one ocassion made me laugh out loud.

All of that being said, in my 125 hours of play, I only ever did ONE black quest before I realized they were procedurally generated quests (the same goes for mission board quests, they, too, are procedurally generated). I did, however, do every single side quest, and I loved it. I was max level in chapter 7, two chapters before the end. If anything most of the time I felt over-leveled for the story missions.

Anyway, all of that aside, let's move on to the other aspects of the game. Combat is good, fast, and fluid. As you level and spec into skill trees, it does become easier to cheese certain fights, but you aren't forced to use those skills if you feel that's cheap or cheating (I'm looking at you, Predator Shot). Personally I like those skills, though. They make me feel like I've progressed and become more powerful.

Graphics are top notch. The vistas are beautiful. Animation, on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired. Decent motion capture would go a long way, Ubisoft!

As far as story goes, I enjoyed all 3 of the main stories and I felt that they were simple but at the same time elegant and profound. And of course as I mentioned before, I loved the side quests as well.

Performance, for me, was great. I am, however, on top of the line hardware (9700K and GTX 1080 Ti), so I can't speak for those with lower specs. I can indeed tell that this game is very GPU hungry. At 1080p my GPU usage can go as high as 92%, so I can imagine ultra settings being difficult to achieve with slightly less powerful hardware.

My final note, ship battles are back! They are good, but still not nearly as good as Black Flag. That game will always be the top mark to hit for naval combat for me. In Odyssey there also isn't a lot that keeps you on the ocean, so while ship battles are still kind of cool, they are far less compelling than before. Don't get me wrong, though, I AM glad they are back!

Here are a few hints to make the game less grindy:
1) Stick to the story line quests until you meet the Cult and can upgrade your spear. Then your #1 priority is upgrading that spear to level 5. This is when you unlock level 3 abilities and you can really do a lot of damage. 
2) This means a lot of cultist hunting early on and a lot of travelling. But uncovering the map is part of the fun :). 
2) Stick with one type of weapon as killing with it will gain you more powerful engravings. 
3) Learn how to manage your stamina and special abilities. Consuming stamina also regenerates health. 
4) Use fire. A lot. 
5) Change/upgrade weapons every 3 levels, change gear every 5. This way you don't run out of resources. 
6) Best way to get epic gear: blacksmiths. When you uncover the most of the map you'll have some 20 blacksmiths you can hit to find decent gear. Also buy a unicorn and ride in style when you have the money. 
7) Pay off any bounty as soon as you get it. It's cheaper this way and less of a chore avoiding mercs. Unless you want to, see next. 
8) Kill any mercenaries you can. They have some of the best weapons and enchantments and the coolest mount you don't have to pay for - the fire horse Abraxis
8) For money and more epic gear fight in any of the regional battles that are raging all over Greece. Once you have about half the map uncovered it's unlikely at least one isn't running.
9) Avoid clearing out all locations, just find the ones with ancient steles (tombs) and ancient tablets (ruins) 
10) If you feel combat takes too long turn difficulty down. After killing my 100th soldier I've seen all the special effects I wanted to see. 

Last but not least, if you don't feel like running around uncovering the map and waypoints, Ubisoft gives you an easy way out for about $10 extra in the store.",True,1540939409,1540939409,True,0,0,0,False

I played a lot of this game, but at a casual pace. Did the main story lines and chased after some interesting side quests. Nothing even remote close to OCD. 

Spent some time exploring and not so much being a completionist.

In all this time, I never felt like I was grinding. I played on normal and finished the story at level 48.

Did not spend any additional money after buying the game.

I'm running an RTX2080Ti. I'm getting 50-60 fps with everything on max. Clouds look great and it is the best looking game I ever played. 

The story is generic, but the world and atmosphere has no rival as of yet. Launching Wticher 3 or GTA 5 after this is a joke from a graphics/world perspective, although Witcher 3 has the much better story.

- Map big enough for 80+ hours I believe.

- You can evolve your character and ship.
- Some story choices does make an impact during your quests.

The open world sandbox with a majority of freedom to the player outside of the protected characters and such essential to story that you've yet to get into (because boy lemme tell you I was quick to attack when I saw a certain character in the city square rallying a mob of people with ""Make Athens Great Again"" only to find out I could not dispose of him.).

The story is nice with a character chose your fate in dialogue approach so you feel all the more in control to the path of your own legend. Granted it did have a minor hiccup there in the sense of some awkward shifts in characters expressions having them go from angry faced to suddenly smiling as you appease them with one line.

The gameplay itself is very fun as it has that black flag naval approach to combat on the Agean seas, and the ground combat has many options to allow you multitudes of approach to combat be it a range specialist, a sneaky snake or a bull that crushes all toe to toe, and any mixe among them all. 

like many games it does have some issues like minor hiccups crashing your game, and I call them minor because at least in my experience the game has had a reliable autosave that put me right back or just a little bit around the moment of the crash so nothing was lost. And in the 60+ hours of gameplay I had only experienced 2 crashes which I may be lucky idk.

The game also has so much content with exploring this massive world be it sunken temples and ships caves across the lands. you have your own choice to skulpt the lands in conquest battles if you so wish to overthrow the ruling power in many of the areas.

overall after 60+ hours to beat the main portion of the game there are still many hours outside of that for additional finds and things to complete.

[b]Impression[/b]

So I've been playing [u]Assassin's Creed Odyssey[/u]  for a while now, doing the Kefalonia quests, getting to know the characters, completing each location, you know, all the jazz. Of course, I'm on the hardest difficulty, it takes time to win some fights. Got stuck for 30-45 minutes on the Cyclops 'boss  battle' until I decided to respec my abilities then completed it easily on the first run with the new build. So, basically, got the first are 100%'d as a regular RPG perfectionist would.

Now then, go to the are leaving part and there's THAT cutscene, and it's soooo good. Sparta's vibe, sick video whatsoever. And bam, the cutscene ends, she says THAT and the Ubisoft logo appears saying that [u]Assassin's Creed Odyssey[/u] is presented by them, all whilst a sick soundtrack playing in the background.

[b]The greatest Assassin's Creed game in the series[/b]

What can I say, by far the best installement in the series, overtaking even the undefeated for many years [u]Black Flag[/u] .

[b]Technical details and evaluation[/b]

The graphics are great. Not perfect, great. Perfect would require 4k textures and 4k premade cutscenes but I don't mind them running on the in-game engine as it looks good. Perhaps incoude RTS in the future?

The soundrack is nice and pleasant to listen to. I choose to play with Kassandra as her voice actor was rated better when I was presented with the choice and decided to Google which of them plays better. Great voice acting in the game, the Greek lexicon and accent is mostly fine with a few sucky English-Greek-Wannabe actor exceptions.

The game runs smooth on 1080 Ti. 71 average FPS, peaking 135 and the rock bottom 37 as the in-game performance info states.

[b]VERDICT[/b]

DEFINITELY a must-buy for any fan of the series, not to mention RPG and great game enthusiasts. I've seen it being compared to the [u] Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/u]. That game is a masterpiece. This game is another one. If everyone always rater EVERYTHING in comparison to the Witcher 3, you'd only want to play the [u] Witcher 3[/u]  and no other game will be the same (with the exception of [u] Cyberpunk 2077[/u]  of course (HYPEEE!)).

RDR2 is an incredible game, unbelievable atmosphere and and character interaction.

And yet, coming back to Odyssey tonight and hitting my 38 hours playing Odyssey, I have to say. Odyssey is an incredibly enjoyable experience. Gameplay has flaws but overall I can play it for several hours straight and not get bored.

RDR2 I feel I'll have to take in small doses, because while it is a remarkable experience. It's also slow and at times boring.

I know it's a shitty way to rate a game, by directly comparing it to another. But I feel in these specific circumstances, with Odyssey being so heavily scrutinized and RDR2 being put on this Game of the Year-bound pedastal. That this review might be useful for someone.

1) It has quality of life improvments over the previous game, Origins, which you should also buy eventually. It has a discovery mode so you can feel like like you're chasing objectives and more like you're being immersed and overall better mechanics
2) the RPG-like quality to this game is great

The dialogues are usually well put together. Character voices and acting are mostly great. (One exception are spartan commanders for battles, they sound like try hard bad boys)

The quests are mostly endearing, thoguh I have not quite seen twists and such to W3 levels.

The scenery is amazing, the detail is second to none. I once sat and watched three characters go through an entire religious ritual to a god, without my involvement and all. Characters laugh, sleep, joke, dance fight and so on, all around you.

The cities do start to blur, but that is very finelining. Most of them feel unique and have a true character to them.

I enjoy the combat, though as the game goes on it leaves historical and moves into mythical (I have no problem with that, but some may).

Travel is great, horse, ship, swimming and feet. There are less things to climb other than some impressive temples, but that seems less of an issue, except when you really like death from above.

Mercenaries and cultists are a great add.

There are relatively few bugs, but they do pop up now and then (I once had to take on the entire Athenian navy myself and thoght it was silly, but on a reload my Spartan allies actually joined the battle)

I have enjoyed the direction the franchise has been going. I thought it was a bit weird at first to set this 400 years before Origins, but then I realised that they do not actually mention Assassins or Templars within the Greek world parts of the game and it made a bit more sense. 

Though there are a lot of well thought out missions, it could do with a bit more diversity in general pick up mission types, and I could probably do without the over the top sexual advances from a few characters. Not that I mind sex in games, but a bit of seduction or hints rather than straight up proposals clumsily thrown at me would be nice. 

All in all I highly recommend.

To be very clear for anyone who loves the assassins creed franchise and playstyle, this is not that kind of game By Far. This is Warriors Creed designed to be a single player MMORPG in a world of precurser artifcats. I do like some of the game and it does some things very well, but unfortunately, it does more than fall short in many important aspects.
Pros: Graphics (10/10) in all aspects. Nuff said.
         Audio (8/10)
         Less out of Animus time.
         Has a ton of content.
         Huge world.
Cons: ITS SUCH A GRIND. All games have progression, but not all make it feel like so much work.
          Item system is chance based and MMORPG style.
          Combat system is lengthy and unbalanced to support the MMORPG chance based item system.
          Story has a good concept but extremely poor script and delivery. It is unmotivating and unbelievable.
          Repetative as a spinning wheel.
Oeverall: This is an amazing looking and sounding game about grinding for the next item/weapon/armor to grind to the next level through repetative side quests so you can see the poorly written cutscene (that is well acted and looks amazing) so that you can grind for more money and resources to upgrade your gear to grind to the next level and get better gear so you can get to the next cutscene. Repeat this for 25-50 hours depending on how much you want to explore and complete. And my biggest gripe is that it is almost impossible to play as an assassin until mid-late game. I would not have minded the grind if the combat was more balanced or if the story was half decenent but overall this game felt like work for unapealing rewards. I hoenstly was more drawn to a novel I was currently reading then playing this and I am a long time game lover, especially of rpg's and the assassins creed franchise. In hidnsight, I would most certainly purchase the game again, but only on sale because even if the amount of content is equivalent to the purchase price, most of this games content felt like repetative work. I probably won't come back to it for a second play through for a very long time.

Some of the side quest are fun but most of them are unmemorable. The rpg stuff needs more refining. I feel like the skill trees were pretty underwhelming in what they offered. The last stealth ability is pointless as by the time you get it you can run around and stealth kill everything without a care in the world. I think the first 10ish hours were probably my favorite because that was before I knew how long and tedious the game was.  This game just like origins has the most  forgettable soundtracks in the series. The monster fights were pretty underwhelming. The only boss fight I died on was the one at the beggining where the giant boar would summon tons of little boars. Man f- uck that boar.

But I do want to point out a couple of flaws that I had in mind:
-The Story isn't fluid, as in the choices ruins the aspect of storytelling for me. Like when the choices appear, I hate how it just pauses the whole game. Yes I know that's what an RPG will do but this just ruins the whole Assassin's Creed.
-Lack of cutscenes. This is also the same with the choices in the game. Every cutscene that plays isn't really a cutscene, it's just a close up at their face and speech. And what's worse is that every action is nearly the same. ""Here's what you asked for"" **moves hand**.
-Upgrades are the chore. Ok, I know I said this game isn't a lot of grinding but upgrading equipment is a waste of time. The amount of resources it takes to collect and upgrade is ridiculous. Not to mention, there isn't a ""buy all"" button for the resources.
-Realism isn't there. For this though, I know it's a game but what's up with the Leap of Faith skill. You don't even take fall damage anymore. Also with ships, where the heck do all crew members come from?? Is there a clone machine?

Ориджинс мне не очень зашли и я вообще не планировал больше играть в серию Ассасина, особенно после всего этого нытья про микротранзакции. Но один мною уважаемый ютубер, вдруг посоветовал мне эту игру. И я плюнул, расчехлился и взял ее в стиме разумеется, ибо сами понимаете. Сразу дам совет всем новичкам, играйте за бабу. Она логичнее подходит по сюжету как главный герой(не буду спойлерить просто поверьте, нужно играть за бабу) и еще, если вы нормально понимаете английский, то играйте без перевода. Я протестил наш перевод, может он и качественный, но как они говорят с акцентом в оригинале это бесценно. Malaka. Графика, качество игры просто шикарно. Багов я никаких не заметил за цже почти 50 часов игры. Играть всем советую только на максимальной сложности, ибо так оно интересно в 100 раз. Боевка мне очень понравилась, особенно обилки война там где он всех молотом нахер воротит, в битвах-конквестах просто бесценно. Валиш всех молотом джейсона, понимаете  о чем я. К луку я вообще не прикасаюсь в этой игре ибо считаю это извращение, которое полностью ломает каеф от игры. Теперь к микротранзакциям и к гринду, о котором многие в интернетах ноют как самки. Так вот, если вы конечно не даун и не обновляете свою броню каждый пять минут, то гринда в игре нет от слова вообще. Лично я не собрал ни одной палки в лесу. Если мне нужны ресурсы, то я просто на своем боевом судне мочу мерзких спартанцев. И я прокачиваюсь исключительно выполняя только морские заказы. Я не бегаю по заданиям НПС принеси, подай, убери. Я беру нормальные боевые задания на судах. Если вы купили такую огромную и не дешевую игру и хотите зачем-то пробижать сюжэет часов за 10, то вы просто даун, пойдите убейтесь об стену и играйте в тетрис, там нет микротранзакций. Так вот например квест уничтожить 25 спартанских судов, это фан плюс это лут, плюс это почти 30к опыта. Потом вы можете убивать охотников за головами, потом вам нужно истребить культ, что впринципе вообще отдельная часть игры про культ в игре про ассассина. Короче я как ярый хейтер серии игр ассассина (*кроме 3) ставлю игре 10 баллов. Я реально в нее залип и получил и пока еще чаю максимум кайфа. Установил РДР2 на релизе, но не могу отлипнуть от ассассина. брать и играть однозначно. И вкачивайте свое судно как можно быстрее, это упростит гринд и сделает прокачку просто шикарной. Для примера я играл в свое удовольствие, выполнял только те квесты и задания, которые мне нравились, бился на судах и в один момент игры я решил посмотреть сравнение моего уровня в игре и уровня среднестатестического ютубера на этом же этапе сюжета. Так вот смотрю я и вижу у 3х человек сюжетный момент называется симпозиум и у всех ютуберов там 14 левел, а у меня 21. А потом  эти ютуберы ноют что в какой-то момент им нужно выполнять скучные задания. Вывод - люди просто не умеют играть в игру и тупо бегают от знака вопроса к знаку вопроса, как в сами знаете какой игре кхкхмак. Так вот в игре есть дейлики и прикольные квесты на досках.

- Big open, and a beautiful world with tons of fun quests

- Long game, took me 80 hours to finish the main quest, and then I still have 2 other 'main quests"" which I have to finish

- Choices and decisions that will impact the story. I think there are 4 endings to the game; the best/good ending, the bad ending, the worst ending, and then you have the secret ending. 

The Cons:
- Alot of item grinding, and equipment maintenance. You constantly need to find or upgrade your gear, which in my opinion is ok, but it costs ALOT of resources to do it. Then it gets tedious to go in to the forrest to slay x100 deers and boars to get the 700+ leather or skin to upgrade your item. Offcourse you can upgrade your item instantly after leveling up, then it only costs 100+ leather! It's kinda annoying.

- Melee combat. This is IMO pretty bad on this game. Its pretty hard to fight more than 3 people on this game because  they will gang up on you and just spin-2-win. They also have insane HP and they scale with your level. The blocking hitregistration is also buggy at many times.

Pros
Good Graphics Capability obviously building off origins.

Cons

Stories: Really good, interesting well-designed characters with emotional stories. There's repeated dialogues here and there but it's just nitpick.

I like the idea of the AC franchise dipping it's toes into the RPG genre, brings something fresh to a franchise that was starting to become stale...Now I hate UPlay...it's the BANE of playing Ubisoft games. If I don't play one of their games in a certain amount of time, it locks me out of my Ubisoft account with that stupid google authenticator, no matter what code I put in it never works...so I go and start up different ones till it lets me sign in on my PC, then I can sign into the game I originally wanted to play...Welcome to the ""Master Race""...smh

When I first picked this up I played it for an hour or so, and it seemed so similar to origins which I played a lot that I was kinda like...uhhhhh facepalm! So many textures it felt like they copy and pasted to Odyssey. Then there is the fighting, which I am EXTREMELY disappointed in, it's literally the same fighting style from Origins, minus being expanded and improved. I was a bit let down that I'm already tired of the fighting style, but you are doing the same moves over and over...I've dodged attacks and been like magenetized or warped back to the sword I just dodged and die...it happens more frequently than it should for as long as they have been making games for.

There is a lot to like though, enough to warrant buying it, whether u get it on sale or buy it at full price it's a game that can keep you occupied for some time. I played this for an hour or two when I got it, then didnt play it again for about a week and change. Once I got past the ""Oh jesus it's so close to Origins"" dread and started playing it again and started getting into the story I started to get interested. It starting to feel like it's own game, the detail on the character's and ppl you interact with are stunning. I feel like I'm watching a movie when I watch the cinematics, except for the movement of their lips isn't quite perfect, but very close none the less. I am in awe (literally) everytime I am running around in Ancient Greece, it's quite a sight!

The RPG element is...Eh...I've done certain things that can have different outcomes depending on what I choose, but a lot are like Fallout 4 ""RPG"" Most of the conversations I've tried to get different outcomes I jsut end up in the same place as the other choice I made...But as Assassin's Creed isn't an RGP genre I can cut them some slack and appreciate the life they are trying to pump back into the franchise...>cough< >cough< Unlike Fallout 4 >cough< >cough< Bethesda whose roots started in RPG and I hold to a higher standard than a franchise like AC and a game like AC Odyssey.

I am enjoying this game now that I've looked past the copy and paste elements from Origins, and experienced the Odyssey aspect of the game. My biggest issue with Odyssey is the fighting mechanics, and stupid immersion breaking glitches that are just infuriatingly annoying...like a mosquito that won't go away.  Playing it on hard against NPC's that essentially cheat to simulate difficulty is fine, but when you work so hard to beat a crap load of guys who are way more powerful than your current level taking tiny slices of health off their bar, it can ruin the fun when you die not only from the mistakes you make but the mistakes the game makes...I die enough on my own I don't need the games help.

I don't know when developer's decided it was more important for games to look awesome, and play like crap. But that seems to be the standard nowadays. I expect more from well established developer's like Ubisoft, and they've made enough money TO NOT SKIMP OR SKIP THE TESTING PHASE! Hell I'll test your games for FREE, just put me in the credits...I would honestly wish they made the map just a fraction smaller and put that much into polishing the game and making the fighting great again, even if they want it to be less like the fighting of Assassin's Creed of old. They can add more moves to change things up a bit and add more finishing animations. Watching the same 5-10 moves for each weapon is sweet the first 20 or so times...but after a thousand guys killed its just like....there's something missing here...

I recommend Odyssey because it is a good game, has some faults like a lot of what Ubisoft kicks out nowadays, but it's become so commonplace to give ppl have developed games and sell them the rest and update it as WE test it for them, that I really wish Ubisoft would act like the veteran developer's they get paid to be.

Pros:
Lots to do
Many areas to explore
Combat system allows versatility depending on your play style
Can play as girl or guy, whichever character you do not play as will still appear in the story
Graphics are great as long as your GPU can handle it. (I have RTX 2080 and get 66 avg FPS on ultra settings @ 1080p as reported from the in-game benchmark test)
I really enjoyed the Atlantis story line and associated quests, very fun/entertaining.

XP can feel slow to get to 50.

The open world is absolutely gorgeous, the world is packed full of content to do and it is just a thrill to play the game. 

[b]Pros[/b]
Combat has been massively altered, with new abilities to mess around, making experiences feel fresh every time given how any new abilities you can try out. It is fun when it works. However, there are many flaws in the new system. Firstly, you cannot dodge when holding down the shift key. The addition of abilities feels very cramped as you try to use the abilities while trying to dodge and parry the hell out of the way. There is also no shield which can be very deadly in fights against multiple enemies. The enemies also attack very fast giving you little to no time to react. If you think the current build doesn’t work out, respec is always an option. 

New mechanics added to this game includes dialogue options and naval combat. Some dialogue options sometimes feel like they are there just for the sake of it, but others do make an impact in the game, like being able to romance the character should you go a certain dialogue path. Naval combat is now part of the open world gameplay instead of just being missions like in Origins and it is very fun as you anchor ships by damaging them, boarding it and beating the shit out of the crew, looting all their treasure chests and go back to your ship while their ship sinks like a badass action hero, or just cleave it in half. New live content will bound to make the game feel fresh. The attention to details are also mind-blowing. For example, if you collected a quest item beforehand, a different cutscene plays telling the character that you have already found the item. In the open sea you can sometimes see sharks jumping out of the water, and the underwater area is as superior as the land. 

The fire mechanics, which is horrible and inconsistent in Origins, have been drastically improved in Odyssey. In-game resources now feel like something useful unlike in Origins where a large chunk of it is sitting in my inventory, and I hardly touched the drachmae in Origins.

In the game you can choose between Guided and Exploration Mode. Guided Mode is like other AC games where the objective markers are given to you straight away, while Exploration mode gives you clues about the destination and asks you searching for the vicinity before using your eagle to pinpoint the exact location. I highly recommend Exploration Mode because it gives a sense of immersion. I don’t think I will want to go back to Guided Mode anymore.

[b]Cons[/b]
That being said, is the game all good? Nope. There are somethings about the game that I don’t like. Firstly, the stealth assassination mechanics have become a lot harder to use, because now half of the enemies cannot be assassinated without upgrading skills, making assassinations less viable in early stages of the game, which contradicts what assassins should do. 

The AI is still annoying and sometimes buggy. Kick an enemy and the whole compound will get alerted, which is nonsense. 

Furthermore, Uplay overlay is a must to get the in-game shop and the Oikos of the Olympians merchant to work, which is ridiculous and asinine and makes me wonder if Uplay is starting to get annoying once again because obviously Uplay overlay will cause reduced performance for my game, since Origins can access the shop totally fine without the overlay. There can be grind involved if you are the kind that ones to just play the story, making you want to buy the EXP-boosters in order to progress the story faster. I am not really affected by it since I am those that play the story at a slow pace, finishing the locations and side quest as I go along. 

Auto saves are also poorly designed. You can finish an entire outpost and die and you will have to restart the quest objective and clearing of the outpost all over again, something I encountered during Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain. You can only assign 4 melee and ranged skills each time which is also stupid as you can’t experiment every ability without going into the menu.

The QA of this game is a joke. Bugs and glitches including scans revealing uninteractable locations, assassination bar sometimes glitching out, sharks clipping through the seabed, oxygen bar sometimes is missing when underwater, question marks on the map occasionally disappearing, live event quests not showing up are just some of the issues I have for this game. Some not so distracting, while some like the missing quests are fucking annoying.

Things that was removed from AC Origins and I hate them doing so includes: The level scaling, which is stupid because what is the point if everything is gonna level up as you do? The option to continuously gain experience points after max level is also removed which I don’t understand why, especially since this game is about progressing to get abilities.

Looking past all these shortcomings, you've got yourself a great game to enjoy.

Being an Assassin's Creed fan who have played most of the series, I can say this being the best Assassin's Creed Game plus a great RPG game. 
I would also like to compare it to Witcher 3 which is one of my favourite RPG title. Though, the story elements were pretty deep and interesting in Witcher 3, but the open world exploration, combat,animations and our Horse is much better Assassin's Creed Odyssey .
Choices really matter in this game you may some time may not be able to predict the result of choices. 

All kinds of new enemy system is amazing. You need to kill Cultists, the mercenaries, wars between Atenians and Sparta, and fantasy stuffs like legendary animals, mythical creatures are too. 

Inventory system is cool and feels like real RPG.

Beside all the positive stuffs, at last i would like to point out a few Cons of the game.

Cons:
-Bug1: where quest objective may not trigger on reaching and need to reload saves to make it work.
-Bug2: Don't stick to underwater walls too much or may reach another glitchy world and die by losing breathe. (I just fast trvelled to save myself)
-You don't much control over your speed in certain areas and feels a bit annoying.

0,137,5,3600,2127,76561197982431905,0,english,False,45474743,"I played and completed the first few Assassin's Creed games including Blackflag and some of Syndicate. With Syndicate I never really got that much into the story, and the physics (like climbing up a wall) were so outrageous looking and the whole story to me lacked the ""getting into the story"" part. This game has redeemed it, I find myself attached to the story of the Misthios, with the cult and the war vs Sparta and the Aethians. I highly suggest this game to ANYONE who is up for an RPG (of which includes some grinding, but VERY tasteful grinding as most missions don't seem like sidequests.

This Assassin's Creed is more of an RPG rather than a story-based game, a very welcome change to me. PLEASE don't let the number of my CONS throw you off, these are just specific instances that have aggrevated me, but I fully believe the PROS outweigh them (even if providing less examples). I would buy this game again at full price.

PROS:

-Amazing story, at the beginning, you think you know who the bad people are, but you end up finding out things aren't as simple as they seem.

-It certainly isn't a ""grindfest"" as others have said. Sure if you straight follow the mainquest line the whole time, you probably will need to level up. However, while playing this game, looting, killing mercs, and doing interesting sidemissions, I have not ran into a quest too high level for me (besides the special missions) since I was level 15, and I'm level 37 now. These people don't understand the game isn't made to only do the storyquests, it's about exploration.

-The game scales to level for most things. For examples, if I pick up a quest at level 7 and I'm 30 now, the quest will be level 30. Almost all enemies on the map will be the same level as you, or higher, they won't be lower. Every piece of gear can be upgraded to match your current level, so you can use any gear you want. Uses a TON of resources though, for example, me upgrading my level 29 chest to level 35 (I was level 29 3 hours ago), I almost ALWAYS need to grind 300 or so more leather to upgrade 4 of my legendary pieces, I always use the same gear, I just upgrade. This is more of a CON because of the grinding required.

-This game has me playing for 40+ hours (lost track) and I still want to keep playing, I always have trouble quiting for the night.

-Most quests FEEL like they are part of the story (some do affect the story or make cutscenes go differently). There are a small few quests which you can tell they are just little ""sidequests"" ""go here, kill them, etc"". But you can tell these quests pretty easily, and a lot of the others have a place in the story.

-The GENIUS developers remove your helmet during the cutscenes, I'm so glad they don't show your character wearing a dork helmet while having a meaningful and dramatic cutscene.

-You have a ship, but unlike Blackflag (THANKFULLY) the game doesn't FORCE you to do many ship missions besides a couple. I despise the ship missions, however if you do them, you can straight sink them or board them and take down the crew for more supplies.

CONS:

-My absolute BIGGEST gripe with this game is that there are no cutscenes when you kill basically anyone. In the first few games it was always amazing to watch the main character and the person killed having a conversation, you get a sense of ""wow that's a real person... I can kinda see where they were going with their radical views"". In this game, you just kill them. That's basically it, there is no heartfelt speech, or them stating their last words, they just die as soon as you asassinate them, could have been better, even just a few lines.

-Beginning of the game can be VERY difficult if you spec into Assassin early. The game tends to force you into these battle sequences for about 3 missions (you have no chance of stealth), but after that you can be as stealthy as you want).

-AI NPCs are nice, they keep up with you, only like 2 missions you must walk as slow as them. However, there are a couple missions where you rescue a hostage and the second you get out of the fort, if you happen to walk BY Aethians, the idiot AI will attack them and get himself killed, causing you to fail that mission (doesn't cause game overs). The same goes for any ""escort"" missions, they are notoriously difficult in this game because the enemies straight attack them and while you are trying to stay alive they just die. Most of these are sidequests that aren't relevant to the story though so it didn't bother me.

-Beginning of the game, you level so fast it's hard to keep your gear up to date, especially without any abilities yet. You can have a REALLY hard time killing someone 1 level above you at the beginning.

- Sometimes the controls can be a bit wonky, I still want to keep holding shift all the time but it just forces Kassandra to climb up a wall. And when I want to drop down, if you hold left while dropping down, she doesn't quite do what you want her to.

-There's not enough leather, you have to keep replacing your gear because if you upgrade a good set of gear it costs a CRAZY amount of leather, and considering you don't get much in the game, your ship may end up lacking power. Farming animals is not my idea of fun but hey, I'm doing it anyway.

-Mercinary system is cool, you get a bounty and mercs come running and looking for you. Except that sometimes it's unbelievable because they will go within 40m of you and just mill around, every time you attack or go somewhere, was WAY more prominent in the first game. Sometimes if the mission requires you to fight a couple people, and a merc just HAPPENs to walk by, (they can be a pretty high level for you). They will just start attacking you and you have to hide and then come back and finish the quest, which is hard because THEY JUST MILL AROUND THE AREA. And half the time they are either stuck in a loop or repeating the same direction pattern continuously.

-I never got into the conquest battles, at the beginning it was WAY too hard (especially the first one), after that, I never got into doing them again because they were lame and just a ""fight these 5-10 people and you're done and get 2 epic gear"" plus it's very confusing what affect it actually has in the game besides the battle itself, just wasn't really interesting to me.",True,1540689148,1540690371,True,0,1,0.480769246816635132,False

Pros:
Compelling enough story (Past): Not the best writing i've ever heard but good voice actors get the job done, assisted in no small part by the excellent facial animation
Good gameplay design: The addition of powers is actually kinda cool, i always looked forward to leveling up and improving them 
Beautiful world to explore: i thought that they would focus too much on the ship and make the world 99% water. However going ashore and exploring the incredibly detailed world; i am always excited to see a new region

Cons: 
Stealth: It's much harder to one shot assassinate people now so stealth gets dicey for a game calling itself Assassin's creed. The animations are way too long and often lead to you getting caught.
Present story: First if it's such a big deal that we pick our gender, why do you insist that we play as Layla in the present day. Second, understandably there has to be moments where the game slows down to build hype for the next fight but the screeching halt the game comes to in present day is unbearable. Third, why do insist on this charade, no one wants to be pulled from an already good experience to a mediocre one. In origins i forgave it a little but now it just sucks. Without spoilers there is a pretty cool reason why we wouldnt have to and an amnesia plot would have been better.
Enemy Leveling: This is just the worst, if you’re going to be like the Witcher, go all the way. Do not make someone who is only 2 levels higher than me hit like a truck and have more defence than a brick s**t house. Give players the option to turn off enemy leveling, being extremely powerful is the reward for hard work and dedication to grinding.

The Witcher 3 raised to bar so high that the Assassin's Creed franchise basically had to do a complete overhaul to remain competitive. It's hardly even the same genre as the old AC games. 
It's a full fledged RPG with AC's movement/parkour. The combat feels like a combination of Witcher 3 and Akham games style fighting. It's fun af especially with the super powered abilities you have. 

The game world is absolutely massive and it's probably the best graphics I've seen to date. It feels like a fantasy-esque setting so you'll definitely get some Witcher 3 vibes while exploring.

The Black Flag ship battles are back too. I just miss the sea shanties that the pirates sang in AC4. The greek songs aren't as memorable.

This game is ruined by its near pointless combat model. You just have to hide in one bush and whistle and you can normally kill off most of an enemy camp one by one. If that doesn't work, you can shoot arrows at their head from about two lightyears away or just 'rush assassinate' which is where you one hit kill enemies without sneaking at all. 'Difficult' enemies just have shedloads of hit points, and are rare anyway. There must be 1000 enemy camps on the map and the way you deal with each one is basically identical.

Coupled with that, the character's ability to climb anything, jump off any height without dying and basically, you are in permanent god mode right from the start. It barely feels worth levelling up your character, the starting abilites are so overpowered.

The map is huge, and beautiful, and the story is interesting. But the cripplingly repetitive gameplay ruins this game. I don't know how it got such good reviews to be honest, a good map doesn't make a good game.

0,46,3,4385,2051,76561197989121185,0,english,False,45467799,"I might be one of the few to say this: I didn't like Origins. Not because the gameplay or RPG aspect wasn't good. I just wasn't a fan of Egypt as a setting, nor did Bayeks character really draw me in. I tried my hardest to like the game. I powered through some of the content hoping at least certain aspects of the RPG style would keep me appealed. That being said, when Odysssey was announced, I was extremely excited.  Greek history and Greek mythology has been a favorite of mine since grade school. Most would say the history and mythology go hand in hand. I've even take extra classes during college.  I wouldn't call myself an expert in these fields, but the setting that this game took place not only drew nostalgia, but a sense of wonder.
This game really hit on those triggers for me.  I LOVE RPG games. Now, I won't go as far as to say that this game beats out a game such as the Witcher series in RPG aspects.. they have a long way to go, but in terms of what they have done so far along with the fact that they did a great job incorporating the 'stealth' aspect into the RPG, I'm having a wonderful time playing this game.
Characters: Kassandra needs to be your main character. I higly recommend that. The voice acting of Alexios, while not horrible, is more suited for the role of a villian.  Certain cut scenes just felt more intense and more immersive with those two playing these roles.  WIth them flipped... it just took me out of it. Just give it a watch on youtube. Now what made a game like the Witcher 3 (I'm comparing these a lot.. i know) so amazing is that the side characters were well voiced, deeply flushed out, and even some of the side quests could be stand alone short games themselves.  Odyssey hasn't really hit on that note as quite a few voice acting seemedf to over the top. Yes, it might be because Ubisoft opted for realism and aimed for 'ancient greek' accents, but if you're going to go as far as to take out something like fall damage, you might as well do away with the over the top voice acting.
Overall Gameplay: As of right now, I'm about level 30ish. Every day I look forward to going home from work to play this game, which was NOT the case for Origins.  The microtransactions don't really bother me since I understand that extra funding/support needs to come from somewhere, but the leveling system seems much more fluid with the increase experience buff. There is a bit of grinding from level 30 and on.
Issues: There are some minor issues with the game, including various graphical errors: eyebrows floating, lions flying, sharks glitching into rocks (which actually helps), etc. But these are such minor issues and have been addressed throughout this games current weeks of play. 
Community Events: The community events definitely feel more 'optional'.  In Origins, I felt as the events were almost required to enjoy the full game. After missing 1-2 events, the overall lure of Origins disappeared. It seemed almost similar to those optional mission objectives.  That's just my own personal opinion and really I haven't played Odyssey even fully enough to really give an even more in depth review, but seriously.  This game is amazing, you really feel the immersion and they do a great job of incorporating their canon story with Greek History and how certain events play out.",True,1540657525,1540667194,True,0,1,0.523809552192687988,False

I liked this. A lot. Like. I actually liked it enough that I went back and played black flag for the first time. That was a mistake. Going back to their older games went to just show how clunky their old system was. Like, it wasn't fun.

This one though has enough elements that I like, that I ended up getting all but five achivements and cleared out every little sub area on the ground. (ignored the water ones. Didn't feel worth it) Which actually brings me to my first big pro towards this. No matter where I went, there was something to do. Maybe they were small and repetative. But there was something. 

The combat too felt good. Though any ability that uses assassination damage gets a little OP when you focus on it primarily.

I know that this isn't a super in depth game review or anything. But this game just sorta hit all the good points for ME. A game like Red Dead Redemption 2 wasn't. The world felt too empty. Super detailed, but empty. (And the less said about their awkward movement system the better)

Overall, I do feel it's worth your time. Just don't zone in on ONLY the story. I don't feel like that's where the game's strength lays.

0,299,3,8379,1540,76561197995781690,0,english,False,45457156,"Assassin's Creed: Odyssey is a truly massive game, befitting of the name 'Odyssey.' I have played several other Assassin's Creed games, but none of them have grabbed me in the same way that Odyssey did. I didn't want to play anything else for weeks after it was released, and I still don't. Unfortunately, having completed all the branches of the main quest and all the side quests I could find, I am left waiting for the DLC to follow, as well as some light achievement hunting and resource hoarding. But I still itch to get into the world, to explore the last few question marks on my map and to finish out all the locations, and to sail the waters, wreaking havoc on pirates (and, honestly, any ships with shiny epic sails and a chance of good loot!).

For me, this game was different from all the other Assassin's Creed titles. Some part of this was due to the newly-added roleplaying elements. Although not extensive -- the ""branching dialogue"" is inconsequential in many of the scenarios, so in some sense it's an illusion of choice -- they do give one a feeling of control and ownership of the story. I felt very invested in the story of Kassandra. No spoilers here, but I can say that I enjoyed the twists and turns of the story. There is still the perennial Assassin's Creed problem -- the shoehorning of historical figures into important narrative roles isn't any more charming here than it ever is, but it did help to provide a framework for the overarching story. 

The gameplay was phenomenal, with fluid and cinematic combat (on foot, at sea, and in conquest battles). I've read that a lot of people mentioned falling behind in levels, necessitating a kind of 'grind' to get to a level that allowed progression of one of the quest branches. I didn't have this problem until very late in the main story, but even then I didn't feel like I was being deprived of continuing with the story. There was so much to do in terms of different story arcs, side quests, bounties,  exploration, etc. that it was just a matter of doing something else fun. Oftentimes I forgot about going back to what I needed leveling up for, becuase I was having too much fun sacking forts, sinking pirates, finding treasure, assassinating leaders, etc. to want to rush back to the story quest. It probably helps that I was obsessed in early stages with completing everything from an area before I moved on, so I was usually a few levels ahead. Your mileage may vary. 

I found the mercenary aspects to be the game's less compelling. Instead of choosing a loyalty to Athens or Sparta, you will basically kill, sabotage, attack, rob, and otherwise harrass both Athenians and Spartans -- there is no way around that. There are no consequences for this, aside from a few lines of dialogue throwing shade, but it bothered me a little bit. It wasn't that the system didn't work or wasn't good -- it was a lot of fun to go around, lowering the stability of the regions, fighting the conquest battles, and collecting that sweet, sweet loot. So the problem was really a matter of my incorrect expectations, rather than any fault of the game. 

In addition to the gameplay, which I found engaging and fun, the game is truly beautiful. The cities are well-designed and feel real and lived-in. The character designs are astonishingly well done. Not only are both Kassandra and Alexios really great looking, but other characters look phenomenal as well.

If you liked the navel combat in Black Flag, you'll love it in Odyssey, It's not cannons and fire barrels but it's much smoother and easier to complete. The land combat is very similar to Origins as in it's not impossbile and frustrating compared to past AC games. The map is quite expansive and full of different side quests. I liked this AC more than past AC games because of the way they gave control to the players (You can pick your character out of the two siblings and your choices have consequences). I'm not sure why some of these reviews say that no matter what choices you pick, it ends up the same - because it's not true. When you open your quest menu you can see the ""path"" that your choices have led you to and which main story quests you have to do because of that. Both of the characters that you can pick from are lovable, so you don't have to worry about picking which one's better. Another thing to note is that there is very little Abstergo ""present day"" missions. You start from an Abstergo mission in the very beginning, but other than that the game is more focused on Ancient Greece - which I think makes it so great.

Let’s get the important things out of the way first. 

Is this game worth it? YES. No matter whether you’re a fan of the series or if it’s your first Assassin’s Creed game. The game has an incredible amount of content for its price. 
How does it run? Well, this is complicated to answer. I’ve got a pretty good pc. I ran the game with a 1070 Ti paired up with an i7 7700k and 16gb of RAM. You’ve probably read that this game is CPU intensive and it is. On maximum graphics with some options toned down, I got a really smooth ~70 fps experience. Depending on who you ask, this is an outrageous result given my rig… but I didn’t mind it that much. I can’t really judge the quality of the game story and gameplay wise by how it runs. I don’t think it’s a fair point. If you have a lower tier PC, you can just limit your FPS to 30 and get a console like experience and it wouldn’t really be the end of the world, to be honest. In terms of bugs, well again it depends on each person’s rig but I can say I’ve never ever had my game crash or a game breaking bug. Only once I clipped into a place and had to reload my save.
Alright, now that I’ve got those two questions out of the way, let’s dive into the review.

[b]1. Immersion and world. [/b] Big category for the franchise. Ancient Greece for me was the biggest recreation that Ubisoft had been missing. They’ve absolutely nailed it. I didn’t know that much about this time period but I can say for certain that walking through the cities, riding your horse along the landscape, sailing across the sea and getting to know new islands was breathtaking. I can’t really say how they’ve done it but they have. Getting to new areas doesn’t feel like a chore at all. Maybe in previous Assassin’s Creeds it did; but ever since Origins it doesn’t anymore. If they tell you to go to an unexplored area, you’re certainly going to find interesting things that are going to make you forget what your primary objective was. I don’t want to fall into comparisons but at times that felt like exploring the world in Skyrim. No area feels generic or copied, somehow each part of the enormous map has its own feel to it. 

10/10 on this category.

[b] 2. Gameplay. [/b] If you’ve skipped Origins, this game is going to completely amaze you in terms of gameplay. 
The combat system has been revamped almost entirely. It shares a lot from Origins but it still very different from it. I think it’s very subjective but I liked it a lot. It felt rewarding and at times skillful. Long gone are the times in which you just had to mash the attack button. Now you can dodge, counterattack, light and heavy attacks you can combo and, most importantly, a very developed skill tree you can use in battle. What’s great about it is that you are not forced into following any particular type of playstyle. Do you like stealthy combat? Great, invest into that skill tree and play as a real assassin. You can even choose fast paced weapons that go with it, even poison. Do you like full on combat? Good, invest in the warrior skill tree. Use heavy weapons with their ability to hit many opponents at the time. You can play as you like.
This makes good segue into the next point, the RPG elements of the game. If you are a big RPG player, you probably wouldn’t call this an RPG. Think of this game as Skyrim (comparing…). You have choices that sometimes influence outcomes. I like how you can more or less control what your character says. Maybe you want to be a bit ruder, or maybe you want to be a good person. It doesn’t really matter but just the idea having a choice of dialogue changed a lot. I like being able to interact; I feel more part of what’s going on.
Finally, let’s talk about naval combat. If you liked Black Flag, you’re going to like this aspect here. I personally didn’t enjoy that game much but what’s good about Odyssey is that you’re never pushed into naval combat. Of course there are some missions which require you to sink some ships or things like that, but it is not that bad. I don’t have much to say. I avoided this aspect as much as possible and I’m glad they let you do it. The only comparison I can make with Black Flag is that in Odyssey it feels a bit more lacking when sailing. But, to be honest, I didn’t care much about it.
I almost forgot to mention that this is the first game of the franchise that lets you choose difficulty. Great addition for those longing for a challenge.

9/10 here. I would improve horse interaction and more fast travel points.

[b] 3. Missions [/b]. Once again, if you come from Origins… not many surprises, mostly the same types of objectives but with some improvements (say bye to those missions in which you had to carry people long distances). And, if you’ve skipped Origins… the game is vastly different from the previous ones. No more tailing and I mean at all, none of it. No more chasing people. Side mission are really good, some even having strong arcs that make you want to complete them. You get to know more about the world, the people, historical locations or offer great rewards. This is also a great step forward for the franchise. 
Now, what most people complain about it the repetitiveness and… I agree. It is repetitive at times. Go kill this guy at this place. Go kill this animal. Go steal this. While this is true and repetition is very common I think that given that locations are very different and that the approach you can take for completing them is so varied… I don’t really mind repetition. And, also, let’s be honest, what RPG open world games are not repetitive? I didn’t mind it and after 70 hours I never complained about a mission being annoying and that’s something I could never say with previous games of the franchise.

8/10 on this category. It wouldn’t kill to have more variety even though I enjoyed the game.

[b] 4.Main storyline. [/b] Okay, probably this is why you’re here for. How good is the story? Is it really an Assassin’s creed game? 
The story is good. I liked it. It had some ups and downs. The beginning was a bit slow and then the middle part was excellent; I couldn’t get enough of it. Finally, the ending (or endings ;)?) were good as well. I’m trying not to spoil much, I’m sorry if I sound vague but I can’t really describe it without giving away some of what takes place. In my opinion, the storyline is better than Origins in all aspects but its ending. It’s better than Syndicate, Unity, Rogue and sorry fans but better than Black Flag. It has a present day story but I didn’t like it. They try to make it epic as how present day was in Assassin’s Creed III but I didn’t get into it. I feel I’m not making it justice by being so vague but trust me, it is good, if you’ve enjoyed previous games of the franchise you ARE going to like this one and there are REALLY big things that connect this game to all others. 
Is it an Assassin’s Creed game? YES. The gameplay, the objectives you have, the ideological war, the connection that I mentioned. You may not have Ezio and the creed present but it is part of the franchise.
I’m going to leave it here, see it for yourself and don’t judge the storyline by random people on the internet.

9/10 here.  Overall, great storyline.


[b]Conclusion:[/b]  As I said at the beginning, the game is great. I still have a ton of things to do and I’m definitely going to keep playing. How many times have you said that about an Assassin’s Creed game? That’s, for me, enough of an argument to make me want to play it.
I tried to make it short. I had to skip talking about climbing mechanics, the levelling system, how the storyline breaks with rules of the animus, how the historical aspect and characters combine with the fantasy of the game, the economy system, among others. I thought of them but decided to leave them for the sake of keeping it “short”.

0,250,18,3535,564,76561198258046956,0,english,False,45448971,"[h1]Map Size[/h1]
+ The map is really expansive with a good density of locations to discover.
- A lot of these locations of interest are copy pasted. I would have been much happier to see Ubisoft deliver even 1/5th of the current map, and make each location unique.

[h1]Quests[/h1]
+ There is a very healthy amount of quests. These are reasonably varied and no longer suffers from the problem of trailing missions. Plus, your choices have consequences.
- The quests are written poorly, therefore the consequences don't really matter. Again, I would have preferred to see even 15 quality quests as opposed to what seems like 200+ quests.
- There are microtransactions. I'm not against them as long as they are cosmetic only. Here, however you can buy XP boosters, raw materials, and coins. There is clearly a conflict of interest and by the 25th level, the side quests no longer feel optional. The grind really killed my experience and patience with an already flimsy story.

- Furthermore, you can upgrade your weapons to your current level, but these upgrades are outrageous. On higher levels, you'll need 3x500+ raw materials to upgrade-one item-and considering you have 7 items which are upgradable, this is extremely impractical. Again, this is to promote microtransactions.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
+ They are gorgeous, ancient Greece is gorgeous. Really well done.
- Game isn't optimized well; I'm saying this because some subjectively better looking games like Far Cry 5 and Witcher 3 delivered higher FPS. The triple DRM also kills the performance.

[h1]Exploration[/h1]
+ Exploration is great. There is a Bethesda style navbar compass.
+ Scouting is done through eagle, and it is flawless; maybe the best in any game ever.

[h1]Combat[/h1]
- I didn't like the combat of Origins, and same goes for Odyssey because of two reasons: it is redundant and feels unfair.
- Redundant because the combat is dragged for way too long even for non-boss NPCs.
- Unfair because you take 100 hits to kill a powerful NPC but they can kill you in 4. Well, they must have some superior gear right? Well they're carrying a common broken sword and are practically naked.
- Unfair because a blade through their throat doesn't kill them.
- Unfair because you cannot parry their ""orange"" attacks.

[h1]Stealth[/h1]
+ I think stealth is alright. It doesn't compare to MSG:V or Chaos Theory, but I think it's doable.
- Repeating my point for the stealth attack: stealth feels unfair because my time to go behind a person and find a window when no one is looking at my target goes unrewarded when the stealth attack doesn't kill them. Also WTF is crit assassination? Blade to throat should get the job done crit or not.

[h1]Misc[/h1]
- Different weapons offer different playstyles in theory but in-game there are only two: fast (sword/dagger) and slow(club/staff/axe)
- Romance interactions are hilariously bad.
+ Completing forts is a fun activity.
- NPCs level up with you. What's the point in powering up when everyone else levels up with you?

[h1]Some Opinion[/h1]

It is quite evident that Ubisoft took inspiration from IPs of CDPR, Bethesda, and Konami to craft this game. They took everything great in the games like TW3, MSGV, and TESV and pasted it in Odyssey. It feels half baked at best, let me give some examples; Witcher 3 inspired investigation feels bad because you don't have a witcher sense so you end up looking for a lens icon to further the mission, most of these left me frustrated; MSGV inspired call horse and keep running to mount while running had me waiting for an eternity.

Point is there are a lot of half-baked mechanics in Odyssey which just left me frustrated.

I suggest you watch a video review uploaded after one week of release of ACO to get the real picture. When I bought this game, I viewed the day 1 reviews and they were all prasing this game, but honestly this is not the case. Fun fact: IGN rated this game 9.2/10 and Witcher 3 9.3/10. That's a pretty skewed scale; we might need to normalize 9.2 at 50% and 9.3 at 95% for IGN.

I've played every game in the AC franchise (even it's predessor PoP) and I think that the stealth must be mastered because maybe the title of the game should mean something.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
In conclusion, AC: Odyssey is jack of all trades, master of none. It really needs some polish in mechanics and plot; given one or two more years in development, this would've been a really great game (I said the same thing in Origins review). If you liked Origins, go for it; can't recommend this to a non AC fan.

[b]Time to complete:[/b] 46 Hours

[b][u]Minor Spoilers:[/u][/b] I wasn't going to buy Assassin's Creed® Odyssey when it was first announced. It felt like a copy and waste of origins and didn't feel like an Assassin's Creed video game at all,  however the Greek mythology persuaded me otherwise and after playing the game for a while, I know I made the right choice.

Personally, one of my favourite gaming franchises with an awesome game. Sure, it may not feel like Assassin's Creed, but for damn sure there is a lot of stuff to do in the game.

[b][u]Pros[/u][/b]

We venture into Ancient Greece, land of the gods. Odyssey strictly follows the Greek mythology to it's lore and says true to it which makes the game all more historically accurate. In a stunning and immersive word of Ancient Greece, we have several Greek cities with their own unique diversity. Odyssey felt like one of those games where it just simply blows your mind about how huge the maps are and how insanely detailed they are. The map size is very big, so big that you have to use a boat to travel across each part of the Greek islands. 

We see many several historical figures shown in the game, such as the great King Leonidas of Sparta as well many other Greek mythological creatures, that you may also have to battle. And it's not just combat figures, there are also great people such as Pericles of Athens. These characters are developed to show how they were according to history which just improves the immersion. The character development for the main protagonists (Alexios or Kassandra) are done in the right way too. Every character that is relevant has their own personality and isn't bland.

Odyssey is a sandbox of RPG elements, and so done in the right way. Choices influence the story and can lead to different outcomes depending on what you pick. Levelling is done through quests and clearing out various landmarks on the map. You collect, improve and dismantle various gear to make your character a lot stronger. The diversity in gear and appearance is huge in this game. Each gear matches the play style of your choice. Abilities are unique and have their own strengths and weaknesses. You can kill leaders in real time which can start a war and change the occupying region. Stuff like this keeps the game very interesting.

The story itself felt didn't feel like an Assassins Creed story however, it doesn't mean I didn't like it. Odyssey is a very well made game with a unique story of its own. You venture into the life of the protagonist as they try to move on from the past whilst trying to destroy a certain organisation. My biggest factor for which I loved is that the side quests feel like a story of their own which can be really hard to do in a sandbox game. Odyssey doesn't fail to deliver that though.

The music within the game is very Greek folklore. There is also homage to Assassin Creed 2' theme song with it's own Odyssey twist which I thought was a great throwback.

Very few cons about this game which shows why it's a masterpiece of it's own. One issue I had with this game are the cut scenes. I get that the Devs are trying to make the game impact because of the choices that you make but sometimes some cut scenes feel so weird and some dialogue doesn't make sense for example, one second Alexios could be angry then the next hes smiling. I just wish there was also more Assassins creed references too because it is an Assassins Creed game after all.

Performance is always a huge factor in Assassin's Creed games. There could be some bugs that need to be fixed as well as some random NPC traits. I really hate it when you accidentally hit a Citizen, then a whole mob tries to take you down and you get a huge penalty for murdering civilians. 

Combat sometimes felt clunky and no where near realistic. I wish the combat was realistic because the history around the game sticks true to its lore. It's hard to predict dodges and parry effects which throws you off guard and also lead to death depending on the difficulty that you are on.

I hope you enjoyed my quick review of Assassin's Creed® Odyssey. I highly recommend getting this game as Ubisoft did a great job improving the series with new elements and showing the great world of the Ancient Greeks. It doesn't always feel like an Assassin's Creed game but nonetheless, it has a great story of its own.

Although currently, I've got only 56 hours of play time in this game, which some of you may think it's a lot or only a little, I can assure you that this game will not be a waste of time and money. Assassin's Creed Odyssey has nice graphics and enjoyable main and side quests but these aren't all that this great game has. To tell you the truth, I've always felt that from Assassin's Creed Brotherhood to Assassin's Creed Syndicate, optional objectives tend to limit a player's way to complete a mission if he/she wants full synchronization in the mission. So, in Assassin's Creed Origins, I really like how they don't include the feature anymore and in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the developers even include a choice feature, which, in my opinion, really strengthen the ""I make my own story"" feeling. This really make me enjoy more in-game freedom. Lastly, I'd like to say that I really recommend buying the game but don't complete the game too fast, though, you should take your time and enjoy every bit of gameplay (side quests, location objectives, etc) of this great game, Assassin's Creed Odyssey.",True,1540473723,1540473723,True,1,14,0.632616996765136719,False

0,236,5,6120,1921,76561198036685534,0,english,False,45431971,"Odyssey was a mostly fun game that involved a lot of grinding. With that, I will go over Mechanics, Plot, World and Grind. 

Mechanically: It is an AC game. If there is a triangle of what makes good games, and that triangle is Graphics, Story and Mechanics. AC will almost always hit Graphics and Mechanics. The same can be said here. The combat is very 'stab quitely, fight rhytmically'. This is the same forumula for all AC since the start with the main developments coming in for the Fight Rhytmically part. The fighting is fun and the stabbing is fun. They seem to have given up on the acrobatics though and made nearly everything climable (even sheer marble walls). I suppose this makes development significantly easier for the dev team but its a bit odd. 

Plot: Bog standard plot. To anyone suprised that you are fighting a secret mcguffin, then I would like you take a look again at the game you are playing. AC has done this since the start and if you want a game about assassination, how else could a plot got? Aliens maybe? To be realistic, if you want to assassinate someone, they have to be in some sort of power and they have to be doing something secretive and nefarios (or overtly cruel). I thought it was OK and I liked that the main story was kind of '4 main stories' each with mostly non-satisfying endings. 

World: Very large Ubisoft game. Get ready to walk a lot between quests. The sea is somewhat interesting for ship combat, but its really nothing quite that interesting. If UBI wanted to make ships more fun, then make the below-galley accessible too. Adding something like a 'sea fort' would also make it more engaging. As it is, the ship is just the fastest way to get from one point to another before you find the sync-zone. 

Grind: Least favorite part of the game. If the quests did not involve walking 500+ meters each time, then maybe this would be a bit better. I managed to level up naturally when I found an area I thought was interesting, but overall it kinda sucked I could not just go to another zone and start kicking butt. To note, Steam says I played 100+ hours. It took me about 65 hours to complete all the main quests and the arena. This is about 15-20 more hours than other AC games I have played, including Black Flag. This kinda sucks because AC stops being engaging mechanically at about the 40 hour mark for me. At that point, its 'wanna finish the main quest so I can finally beat the game, I'm really good at stabbing things'. I am not a fan of leveling to be a better assassin and this inflated play time. If your quests are written well, I will play them, regardless of rewards. 


TLDR: Took 15-20 more hours to finish than normal AC games (65 hours to beat all main quests). I enjoyed Syndicate and all versions before that as mechanically sound games with an interesting cast of NPC's. Odyssey is also mechanically solid but the interesting NPC's are too spaced out to be memorable and the grind kills the fun of hitting end game. If you want to stab thing, then this is for you, just try not to stab anything 2 levels above. 



*Warning* This game has lootboxes and other monitization. I did not purchase any because the game failed to keep my attention past the main plot. The game also has a way to permanetly give EXP/money boost. This is poor game design and had the devs doubled EXP gain or something close, perhaps I would have been more engaged with the aesthetic market once I beat the main quest. There are games that focus on story and gameplay that offer micro transactions, and because they are so well written and with plentiful quests, I do sometimes indulge.

Pros :
- Interesting main character
- actually good storyline and drama
- choices really matters, make us feel guilty, too
- challenging gameplay, and also work well
- balanced skill tree ( hunter, warrior, assassin)
- beautiful world, also very large scale
- feels good to explore
- awesome loots 
- did i mention good at exploring? yeah

Cons :
- sidequest needs polishing, need to reduce fetchy technic
- facial expression of other characters sometimes dull
- need brotherhood of assassins to aid (just opinion)
- fast travel only by synch point and ship, need more cuz map is sooo big
- only 1 lvl difference between enemies and you, u cant assassinate them
- lvl difference need to scale more, cuz like 2 lvl above can kill you and unkillable 
- maybe need more kind of shop other than blacksmith (opinion)
- a bit grindy, but this actually depends on what type of person playing, theres a lot of quest for you to play to grind lvl
it actually doesnt feels grindy to me, storyline gud

Which isn't a bad thing since the series is all about being an assassin. Granted the character you play in the Prologue is far from an assassin, it does give you a hint as to what's been changed in Odyssey.

The game was an instant buy for me as I personally love ancient history, especially those who have a rich history with a beginning, middle and end. Japan, China, Rome and Greece are my favorites when it comes to their history. So playing an open world set in ancient Greece at the time of the Peloponessian War.

Haven't really advanced the story alot as I'm mostly exploring and trying to put myself a couple levels above the recommended levels for the next quest or story mission. So I don't know if the war will expand to the next stage or not since you can choose to side with Sparta or Athens in helping to expand or defend the different regions.

Not sure if this should be an Assassins Creed game though. From what I've experienced so far, none of the quests or story missions I've done have felt like I was playing an Assassin. Now I have to worry about if whether or not I'm strong enough to perform an assassination. 
You can no longer choose who you want to kill first as the RPG element now forces you down a more linear path so to speak. I have as much of the Assassins Skill Tree unlocked at my current level and wearing all Assassin type gear and weapons and I'm still having trouble actually trying to play as the games name sake. 
My assassinations just aren't strong enough to even take down normal guards at my same level much less guards who are one level above mine.

Story is still interesting and the game is still fun to play ( I like the Conquest Battles ) but the core component of the franchise is kinda gone here. It's more Assassins Witcher: The Wild Odyssey as opposed to a straight up Assassins Creed game.

Pros:
Game is fucking gorgeous
No crashes, glitches or bugs encountered so far
Major elements of Black Flag makes a return.
Amazing voice acting with proper pronounciation of all Roman/Greek Gods ever mentioned
Can choose between a male or female character
Can make your character look like a Spartan or as an Assassin for the time period or a mix of both ( Spartan Exile Armor )
Very living, breathing world
Historical Landmarks and battlefields
Combat is fun and very versatile. Legendary Kick is a nice touch ( Spartan Kick ).
Mutiple Choices with multiple endings means good Replayability.
Crafting
Choice of playing like an Assassin, a Warrior or a Hunter with the skill trees in place or be a hybrid.
Most of the main Assassins Creed felements are still here

Cons:
Doesn't feel like Assassins Creed.
Starts off way too slow after having a strong Prologue.
RPG elements kinda forces you to go linear rather than truly exploring the world on your own terms.

Each region and island requires a specific level, again that RPG element kinda taking away from the experience, Enemies will one-shot if you try to explore a region or island that's far ahead of your current level.

Upgrading Epic and Legendary gear just becomes increasingly more and more expensive with each new level, having trouble trying to get the thousands of materials at this point to keep upgrading the Spartan Exile armor, or at least the pieces I'm still using.

After 60+ hours of (what would've been) a full playthrough I feel there are some glaring issues. Lack of resources pushing players to use microtransactions or grind, said lack of resources forcing you to not use a major part of the crafting system (engraving) due to constant need to replace your weapons/armor; not to mention the massive resource cost of upgrading your items/ship.

Conquest battles are disappointing, merc system is barebones, feels like the game tries to be both action and stealth yet only succeeds at being subpar at both. Couple all this with a mostly dull sidequest system and a shallow open world and you get a game that, while fun due to an enjoyable main storyline and me being an absolute nutter for history (especially Greek/Roman) shouldn't be getting a postive. Yet I would've done it because I love the Greek shit; however...



Near the end of the game my questgiver has decided to collapse on the ground and the only way I can interact with the limp man writhing on the ground is to pick him up and carry him. No talking, no questgiving, no continuing on my journey; nothing but a Spartan warrior named Brasidas turning into a wet noodle right before the climax of the story.

0,1228,60,4734,3635,76561198064390102,2,english,False,45415133,"I used to be a die hard fan of the series but that ended for me with the Desmond trilogy. While I have enjoyed the newer games they never really sparked my interest, that was until Origins happened and I saw the start of a new era. Just so you get a good idea of what I like in the series my favourites were and still are. Assassin's Creed 1, Black Flag, Origins and now of course Odyssey. It's simple really Odyssey adds just about everything you've liked in the past and jams it with a whole lot of new things to enjoy too. What you will mostly see though is a new and improved version of Origins and it's still fresh enough not to call it the same thing.

The good well first I'd have to say it looks great and on par with Origins. It has tonnes of settings everything you saw in Origins it's here too with a few little differences here and there, but for the most part it should run on a lot of systems with tinkering. The soundtrack is beautiful with a lot of new music and faithful remixes of past soundtracks like ""Ezio's Family."" While I'm still on topic audio is pretty great in my opinion footsteps, armor rattling, wind, swords clashing, boats splashing on waves etc. If you've played any other Assassin's Creed game you know what to expect from sound quality. The world is I'd say at least 2x the size of Egypt in Origins and that game was fucking massive, it's a huge world to explore and I love it explore on land with a horse, travel by foot or even by ship. Now the new and exciting additions to the series, while this point isn't exactly new if you experienced Syndicate but parts of it is. You get to choose between two characters at the start of the game Alexios or Kassandra and the new thing being is fully voiced character choice, like how it is in say The Witcher, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Fallout 4 etc. There is a nemesis system in this game like how you would have seen it in Shadow of Mordor or War. It's much more bare bones here then that game but my god is it fun, it sorta works in the same way stars would work in Grand Theft Auto. A five star system but here it's 5 mercenary icons, starts from 1 and goes to 5 each one of those is a mercenary tracking you so you can wind up with a five man mercenary fight. They of course don't just track you out of the blue you need to commit crimes the more you do the higher the bar goes, you can always pay the fine for the whole thing to go away or kill the person that hired the mercenary to lower the amount thats after you. There's also regional battles Athens vs. Sparta you can help whichever one you want you never get locked into a faction choice, you can kill leaders, destroy resources etc to lower a faction hold on a region and trigger a conquest battle here you will make a choice defend the region holder or help the attackers. You get thrown into a battlefield which looks cool as fuck but boils down to just killing specific people, not much else to it other than getting loot rewards but it's still a great mode. There's more new things to find but I'll leave that for people to find I'm not one to spoil things for people.

The bad well there's a few I mean a lot of people are making a massive deal about microtransactions I get it you don't want to see it in a single player game I don't either but it's easily ingorable, not one thing in there is worth buying towards the game it all comes down to personal preference. Now that's me just talking about the purchasable cosmetics like armor, weapons, ships etc. While I ingore it I hate the idea of being able to buy boosters, crafting materials and shit for a single player game hell you can even buy in-game gold with real life money. Instead of pushing dumb items like that I'd rather them push more cosmetics if they truly need microtransactions. I understand the need for forced auto level scaling it's fun even if I have a love-hate relationship with it, I think it would have been better if it stayed the way it was in Origins an optional setting to turn on or off. The game can be grindy almost sort of like a mini mmo you'll either love it or hate it. You can't fast travel to towns and cities anymore you are forced to find sync points which is fine but still the world being bigger than before makes it slightly more annoying.

[b]--Pros--[/b]
Game has a large and rich world to explore 
RPG elements are still here but have become better

You never get higher than 2 lvls above any area so still challenging but not punishing
Fighting higher level enemies is possible but can be rough
Trying to assasinate higher enemies has cool mechanic that shows them reacting just a little bit faster than you and avoiding lethal damage. 

Sparta kick nuff said

There is some great exploration mechanics and the ship is unlocked early giving a better method of travel early
You can recruit them to be Lieutenants on your ship
Only 4 slots so you rapidly fill those positions and run out of reasons to have more
Could have benefited from a system like Black Flag where you had them go collect resources on your behalf. Given a reason to keep recruiting. 

Letting you upgrade gear if you find a stat set you like is great because there is a reason to keep
Feed junk gear to your better gear via breakdown


[b]--Cons--[/b]
Ubisoft game so there are still plenty of glitches to go around
The mercs are poor man nemesis system from Shadow of everything

Some of the narrative with the cult feels forced and cartoon villain like
“We are out to get power!” not really an explanation for motivations

Microtransactions are complete garbage and only detrimental to the overall game
They are at least not obtrusive and only there if you go looking for them

Leveling can be taxing if you do not follow a certain way to do it. 

Game runs well on PC but is also CPU hog for no reason
Modders have already found how to better manage the ingame resources, but were slapped out of forums for “cheating”

The game plays like  Assassin's Creed Origin's and thankfully the AI has been made smarter. By that I mean, animals like bears and lions will chase you unless you break their line of sight and even then you might have to scale a wall and kill them with arrows.

The NPC's and bounty hunters will also track you but will stop if you break their line of sight. Which means you can lure bosses away from others and snipe them with arrows to lower their health or kill them.  

One annoying thing I've noticed about bounty hunters in forts, is that no matter where you move they seem to follow you around even if they haven't spotted you. If you move to another section of the fort or camp the bounty hunter will move near you. They don't attack but they always move close to where you move which makes it a little more challenging to kill everyone in a fort without being spotted by them.

I swaer to god if I hear NPC's use the word ""malakas"" one more time I will scream.

For some reason Ubisoft thought it would be funny for the NPC's to scream ""malakas""  which transalets to  a*hole or jerk everytime they search for Alexios or Kassandra. It was funny the first few times but my god not all game!

There are plenty of other Greek swear words they could have used, like Gamóto, Archidia and Ái Gamísou to name a few.

Bugs do exist, but are not game-breaking. Micro transactions exist as well (which is sad for a single player game) to speed up progression, but that's not a problem for me. If you don't wanna buy, don't buy, go grind and have fun. 

Game needs some optimization though, since its performance is not good and not stable., and the presets are just bad. Not a huge problem for me, since i game with an: Intel i7-4790 + GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G (MSI), averaging 56 fps, at 1440p, with custom settings in a combination of Ultra High + Very High + High.

The mercenary system is downright terrible. It seems Assassin's Creed Odyssey has gone pillaging Shadow of Mordor for a lazy way to keep the game challenging. Not only are new mercenaries added to the lineup ad infinitum, meaning you will never, ever, kill them all. Mercenaries swarm you the moment you enter af fort, and before you know it, you have four or five complex enemies, who may be multiple levels above you, swarming you and one-shotting you for the hell of it. It is effectively ganking in a single-player game, and it is honestly horrendous. The worst part of it, though, is the result is you never feel truly powerful, as you know that no matter how high you get, if you try anything, half a dozen elite enemies will be swarming you before you know it - and it's not like they have fixed locations. They spawn in your vicinity as your bounty increases.

Additionally, this will make keeping up with equipment hard because the stuff will be dropping a level or two higher than you can use leaving you underpowered almost all the time.

thank you for this representation of Acropolis and Athens like it was. The feeling was amazing and I would only buy the game again to see this. And thank you for showing this to the whole world too. 

I am not very fond of the plot of this game, to be totally honest to you. The main character I am playing (Alexios) is kind of a douche and I cannot relate to him. Also he is overloaded with Greek cliche's. Spartan, carries Leonidas spear... [spoiler]rumor has it he may be a Demigod too...[/spoiler] ... I think all this is kind of too much. I would prefer a story that would not include so much of the mythology in it, however, mythology was a big part of the Greek inspiration but I didn't want ALL of the mythology on the character. You tried to put every single Greek idea in there but ... sometimes less is more, really.

But the feeling of being in that place in that time is incredible... only to look and listen can be enough.

About gameplay features:

Combat: 
Too hack and slashy for my taste. I kind of liked the laidback combat system of other assasin's creed titles. Timing parry and counter attacks was cool.  

Infiltration:
In AC infiltration was always easy but this time it's even easier. All enemies conviniently always look the other way, their line of sight cone feels like it's only 30 degrees.

Parkour:
Making it possible to climb 99% of this game's surfaces, has removed the strategical element of fort infiltration. Once detected, all we have to do is climb a 50m wall and jumb. Jumbing from high places also doesn't kill so easy.

RPG:
It's weak. The main story line took like than 10 hours to kick in. I was ready to uninstall the game because the first area did not do much introduction and then only after the battle in Megaris scenario starts to kick in. The side quests are totally, totally basic. We basically play fetch all the time. About the romance feature... argh...it's too comic. [spoiler]In Greece we say that when someone has sex with some old or ugly lady, is a true hero ... well, I made sure Alexios is one, and that was fun[/spoiler]. However, the RPG element is kind of weak and most of the dialogues are two options, without much thinking of which one is the right one.

Game Ideas and mechanics:
Ok, this game needs a lot of work for completion. Even 15 hours in, there are still new (not experienced before) things that pop up as to do. However, I feel that it becomes so overlapping with the original AC experience and the whole game arrangement needed a better fine tune.

Some things don't make sense:
- Why are there Spartan ships alone, outside Athens.
- Why are there Athenian soldiers, alone, outside Spartan camps.
- Why are there wolves everywhere for the first 10 hours.
- Why is not clear in armies combat how the ""weakening"" takes effect
- Why is the territory leader so important then? From all I understood, ""weakening"" a nation, only puts the leader to a tent for an easy kill?

Large combats:
It's mob vs mob, at list at first, I don't know if it will get more of a strategical element to it later, but I doubt it. The Greeks were experts in tactical combat, the only game that can portray this clearly was Total War: Rome 1 & 2. It would be nice if there was more tactical purpose of the character, instead of trying to break a new hack and slash record all the time. Large combats are very repetetive.

Naval combat:
All good here, pretty much like black flag, but arrows replace canons, and deal a ridiculous ammount of damage, like canons used to. I think it's the Black flag mechanic with different graphics actually. I was really expecting arrows to do a different kind of damage, like kill rowers or the crew and slow a boat down...but instead of that they behave like canon balls and javelins...like bigger canon balls. Anyway. The naval combat feels too fast and designed for action, with little strategical element, again. I would prefer it different.

Conclusions:
To my sense, from the devs side, there was a lot to think and implement in this game in little time. However, first as a matter of rushing things, I believe, some important ideas were left very undeveloped, like the RPG element, a more challenging infiltration system, large scale combat strategy and a little bit more thoughful naval, even fine tuning some basic details of the game according to reason.

I think that if this game had spent one or two more years in development it would have been a masterpiece, but unfortunately now it can barely make it to 6/10, and most of the rating goes there because of the theme and the graphics. I would like to see it redesigned to what it should be.

Most of historical Greek design details are cool, however ancient Greeks did not say ""Malaka"" all the time like this. This is an achievement of us, modern Greeks. So yea, for not treating the Greek theme to make it the masterpiece it deserved to be, I could easily call most of your department leader devs and writers as Malakes, in a symbathetic way of course.

100+ hours of playtime. Enjoyable, thrilling content. No mandatory online playing. No players cutting into your gamespace uninvited. No forced multiplayer or mandatory DLC. The store-bought content is absolutely un-necessary to enjoy the game. XP Boosters and Resource Bundles are for the folks who are just in a hurry to powerlevel to 50, and at no point did I feel like I needed to spend a dime more to enjoy this game. Perfectly done, Ubisoft! It's the best parts of Assassin's Creed, Red Dead Redemption, and Mass Effect all rolled up into one. 

It's a thrilling, superbly written storyline that goes on and on and on. The freedom of movement isn't just about freeclimbing anything vertical, it's the expression of motion that comes from the world being your oyster. At lower levels, higher-level enemies are the only barrier to entering new areas. There are bounties, timed missions, subquests, and even just plain errands everywhere you go in the world. There's never a lack of places to go or people to pay you for your sword and services.
 
Deep RPG elements create substantial consequences for your in-game actions. Killing everyone you meet is a viable philosophy but their story will end right there and you don't get to see the results down the road for mercy, for justice, or for compassion. It's a story where you can be equally the redeeming priest or the vengeful angel of justice, and the game's IC dialogues allow you to nudge the protagonist this way or that way in ways that are meaingingful for the plot and which the character ICly justifies nicely. 

The protagonists have brilliant voice actors and their animations are fluid and believable. Kassandra in particular stands out as the perfect Byronian hero, who goes from being a humble sellsword on her home island to being a powerful, world-straddling mercenary for hire. The voiceover interactions with NPCs and romantic interests don't just feel like pre-recorded dialogue; the conversations have a fluid and natural feel to them, demonstrating an exceptional level of care in delivery from the voice artists. The animators for the character models also went all out to add emotions both in terms of expressions and body language. 

The game's graphics are mechanically outstanding. Crisp, complex textures and well-executed shaders are married to models with high polygon counts and superb interaction with light sources. But it's *artistically* where the game really starts to shine. The first moment I got on board a ship and started plowing through the waves, sun in my face and the rowers singing (authentic!!!) Greek shanties, I was laughing giddily as a kid. I just sailed around for 20 minutes before I decided I should eventually start towards my next objective. Added to the sheer scope of the map, it feels like there's no direction you cannot go. It's the artwork that makes this game so brilliant, though; each city doesn't just feel like a procedural copypasta or a half-assed effort to put NPCs. The cities all look old and well lived in. A close inspection reveals ruins under houses and homes that must have been abandoned centuries prior. The accuracy of these houses goes so deep that I wonder if it wasn't pulled directly from National Geographic. There are variances in home design between Athens and Sparta. Sculptures differ from one city to the next. The use of vertical or horizontal space is clearly defined by the nearby terrain. Even the painting and city artwork is clearly informed by historical analysis of Greek art and architecture. It feels like a complete world informed by rigorous archaeological research, and not someone's lazy idea of what Greece *might* look like in 480 BCE.

Combat is fluid and sensible. The ability to dodge, parry, and counterattack gives you a feeling of total control over the character. Skilled use of these abilities will keep you alive in fights where the odds are heavily stacked against you. The levelling mechanic is an interesting one; an enemy even just two levels above you is an incredibly difficult fight to achieve. This prevents players from simply assassinating everyone they meet or eliminating NPCs 'on suspicion'. Assassination works well, particularly if buffed appropritatley, but it's not the end-all of combat options. Some enemies simply can't be kiled with a one-hit assassination attack. Even if they are, there's a fair chance you'll end up in a knife fight with their allies, and that can turn into a bloodbath very quickly. 

Archery skills are fun and completely viable as tools in your combat toolbox. Melee and warrior talents are equally essential for some fights, but going deep into the Assassin skill tree rewards you with the ability to inflict massive damage in the opening moments of a fight against very tough opponents. But no matter your playstyle or preferences, you can find a means to make any or all of the combat methods viable for you. 

Get this game. It's not only a brilliant RPG, it's the best entry in the AC series to date. It takes the previous game play designs and turns them on their ear. You'll go from killing Athenians one minute to wrapping your brain around Machiavellian plots the next, to encountering ancient artifacts and getting a peek at the powers that literally shaped the world. It'd be surreal to jump back and forth this way, but it's so well executed you  don't even blink.

Short Version:

The Good:

!!! Amazing Main Story
!!! Your choices matter, and affect later outcomes
!!! Main cast is amazing
!!! You don't have to play any other Assassin's Creed Game to get into the story of this one
!!  Combat flows well, Naval combat is at its most refined
!!  Customization and RPG Elements are [b] FUCKING PHENOMENAL [/b] for an AC title
!!  Your Odyssey actually feels like a long and amazing journey that captivates you completely
!!  Playing as a Girl or Guy really doesnt matter, theyre both great
!!  An abundance of good content that makes the 60 dollar price tag feel like a steal
!!  Ancient Greece is huge, and fun to explore and get lost in
!!  Side Quests are actually entertaining
!   Microtransactions are there [b] but not necessary [/b]
!   Romancing isnt awkward, and the game doesnt discriminate against sexualities

The Bad:

XXX Anything tying this game to AC Lore brings the rest of the game down a notch. It just feels out of place and awkward
XXX Some of the most interesting Side Quests dont get a satisfying ending
XX   Voice acting needs some work, very robotic at times
XX   Grinding is necessary because of level disparity that pops up randomly and kinda slows down the main story
XX   Fast Travel needs to be redesigned, its very frustrating at the moment
X     Mercenary System needs some tweaking
X     Your Spartan/Athenian alliegance should have more significance on the main story in my opinion, but it doesnt.
X     [b] Microtransactions are there [/b] but not necessary

Rating: 4/5

Long Version:

This game is captivating, with both its visuals and storytelling. From the first second the game opens and youre playing as Leonidas during the Battle of Thermopylae, it sets the tone for the journey to come. This story takes place well before the Assassins and Templars existed, and the game treats it as such. You play as a full blown warrior, an exiled Spartan. The story is completely engrossing and I found myself to be hooked at every piece of dialouge that would come from Alexios' (albeit slightly robotic at times) mouth. For the first time since ive played Mass Effect, Ive felt that my choices actually mattered. Small seeds would be planted that would bloom later and have massive implications. Even the smallest decisions can shape your future. I loved almost every character the game would introduce, and there were a couple times where the game tugged at my heartstrings and actually made me feel an emotion. This game's world is so big its intimidating, and its taken me over 100 hours to explore most of what the game has to offer. The RPG elements are welcome and refreshing, along with the setting.

Now heres my beef with the game.

Not everything is perfect, be wary of grinding a lot in the later levels to keep up with higher mission levels, and microtransactions are not necessary at all to complete the game, but they do shorten the length of grinding significantly so i feel it is necessary to mention. While Assassinating people is very satisfying, it is VERY annoying that if you are a lower level than your enemy, or the enemy has a yellow bar around his level, you will almost NEVER one hit kill him by Assassination. Instead you take a siginificant chunk of health. As much as I love Alexios' along with all the other characters, their performance at times needs some help. A lot of the dialouge for side quests feel very generic and recycled. I personally feel that the Spartan vs Athenian war needed a bit more focus other than copy and paste conquest battles. It feels as if it has no story significance. And finally the Mercenary system needs some fine tuning. 
Heres a personal anecdote:
I discovered Panteres of the Ashen Wake, the 2nd strongest mercenary in the game randomly within my first 2 hours of playing the game. His description and visual was intimidating, [i] Many had seen Panteres in battle, but none lived to tell the tale. Some would say that he was much deadlier with his flaming bow than his spear, but none dared get close enough to find out. [/i] Considering the fact that he was almost max level helped intimidate me, throughout the entire story i thought of him as this beast that i would eventually have to fight, because his presence was always there on my map. Eventually when the time came, I killed him and felt so much accomplishment that i jumped up. I won! But 5 minutes later that legends icon was replaced by some random dude with a copy paste background story. That really pissed me off, it felt like they disrespected the legend of some dude i got too attached to. Thats probably just me though.

Anywho, heres me griping about some spoiler related things in the game.

*SPOILERS*

[spoiler] This game is a continuation of Origins, and you enter into the Animus to find out where this Isu artifact is. The world is so engrossing and amazing, that when you get pulled out of the greek world, it is jarring and completely halts the flow of the story. In fact, almost everything tying this game to the Assassins creed universe brings it down and ruins the mystery of parts of the story. Maybe its just me but ive just never been a fan of the modern day stuff in the any of the AC Games. Throughout the world you come across Mythical Beasts of legend, such as the Minotour, the Sphinx, the Cyclops, and Medusa herself, but all of them are apparently just projections that the Isu made? Its really deflating and kinda ruins the glory of killing them when instead of taking their heads as a prize you walk away with a bronze ball. Idk, maybe its just me but the fact that they seem to tie in the Atlantis and the Cult of Kosmos storylines to the AC Lore brings both of those questlines down. Alexios' performance after killing a very specific cultist, Chrsyis, is amazing. He yells ""You fucking snake"" and you feel all the emotions that hes going through. When the Cult kills Perikles and Phoibe, Alexios actually breaks down in tears and the game isnt afraid to show their main character cry. Its a powerful moment thats really undercut by a deflated end to probably the coolest and most mysterious side quest in the game. The whole game youre wondering who the Ghost of Kosmos is and youve probably already hunted down everybody else and killed them; but the game expects you to spare The Ghost because she wants to create another one? Even if you do kill her you dont get any satisfying dialouge or anything. It just kinda ends. [/spoiler]

Overall i would say that this is my favorite video game of the year. Its a really amazing huge open world RPG, and a great game. Just maybe not a great Assassins Creed game? Lately the series has gone so far from its roots that this game could probably drop the AC moniker and not much would change. Take that for what you will. The moral of the story is, I got fully lost in the world they built up. I haven't felt such pure adventure from a game since I was a kid, and it was nice to be a kid again for awhile.

Odyssey is a beautiful and a big game with lots to do and that I think this is the problem.  The main AC story has taken the back seat to quanity of things to do.    I love the original games (1 thru Rogue (not really AC3)) because the story kept you engaged to the point you always wanted to see what happend next.  After AC 3, you can see the writers were starting to hit bedrock in terms of how to continue the story.  So while they are getting that in order, they've replaced good story telling with mindless repetitive fetch quests to keep you engaged enough that you won't mind how less engaging the main story is.    It's a bit of a grind to get better weapons or level up and you can see that there is a paywall and them basically telling you ""buy helix credits"" so you don't have to the same quests over and over to level up.

0,206,3,4623,2134,76561198058975496,0,english,False,45384623,"This review is about only one thing: grinding. 

There are a lot of complaints about this, but from my experience, the grinding is not as bad as some make it sound. I play on Normal, and I cannot comment on how the progression feels on harder difficulties. On Normal, however, doing the main quests and a little more than half of the side quests consistently levels me up more than enough for the next part of the main questline.

Of course there are people who consider that amount of side questing to be ""grinding,"" but I don't, because the side quests are actually pretty interesting for the most part. Narrative side quests, which are those shown on the map with an exclamation mark icon, offer either some interesting twists and turns or some new opportunities to get to know a character better. Some questlines (such as Alkibiades' and Socrates') have narrative quality that rivals main quests. Doing them is quite an enjoyable experience so I would do them anyway even without the need to level up. Overall I found it completely unnecessary to do any of the timed quests or procedurally generated side bounty quests to just level up. 

Another aspect of grinding is the cost of upgrading stuff. Yes, the cost of upgrading equipments to your level, especially for epic and legendary ones, is astronomical. But that's why there is also the engraving system. You can engrave a perk onto a piece of newly found equipment, and you can obtain a legendary perk by finding some legendary items. Most importantly, engraving is dirt cheap. In this way the game encourages the player to always make use of newly found weapons and armors instead of sticking to the same legendary sword we got from long ago. If we like the old perk, we can always engrave it onto the new one. Crafting resource is not that hard to come by either - just remember to loot the ""war supply chests"" before burning them. As a last resort, we can also buy crafting resources from blacksmiths. They may be a bit expensive, but gold comes pretty easily in this game. 

Overall, the game's grind would be a problem if we rush the main quests, but if I just take it slowly, do the side quests, clear a bandit camp or two along the way,  and engrave new weapons, I have so far not had any issues with grinding. That's perhaps just how I play, but if you are the kind of player who doesn't rush main quests, then grinding won't be too big of a problem I'd say.",True,1540168285,1540168285,True,0,0,0,False

0,89,10,3005,780,76561198132250414,0,english,False,45381462,"Ok, so, this game, despite the contreversy with the apparently ""necessary"" micro-transactions, is, incredible. There is never a dull moment in the game, so happy i got the gold edition, worth every penny.

The visuals. I dont even know what to say, they are, in a word, beautiful. Whether you are standing atop a mountain, overlooking greece, or getting down and dirty in a swamp, this game, NEVER, fails to impress with its graohics. I've sometimes just, stood still, for a great amount of time, just taking it all in, admiring the beautiful world that Ubisoft have passionately created.

The combat, receives a decent update from its predecessor. The new ability system is HUGELY welcome, and brings a breath of fresh air to the game, and franchise. From the very popular Spartan Kick, to charging through hordes of enemies like a rampaging bull, to literally ripping the shield away from your enemy and smacking them over the head with it, this abilitiy system, rocks, and its so fun to fight in this game. You also feel far more agile from Origins too, due to the extended roll you can do by holding down the dodge button rather than pressing it. 

""But what if I want to stealth"", I here you ask, fear no more! They have addressed the issue Origins had with stealth, now with the newly added damage types, you can gear towards, more assassination damage, or warrior damage, or even hunter damage to become more efficient with a bow. And just incase that isn't enough? They added a skill in the assassination tree that makes you do ridiculous damage to an enemy whilst you remain unseen, sometimes even one shotting the toughest of enemies (enemy level dependent though, dont go trying that on a guy that is 10 levels above you, he will plant your face firmly in the ground). You can even more or less insta kill a mercenary (more on the mercenary system later) if you manage to get the jump on them, making stealth, just as viable as going full loud, balls to the wall fighting.

The mercenary system, boy oh boy is this where the game gets interesting. These guys, will stop at nothing, to kill you for their fill of cash. If you are spotted by a civilian, killing, stealing, or just behaving innapropriately? then expect one of these guys, or multiple, depending on your bounty level, to be coming after you. It adds a welcome element of unpredictability to the game, just when you think you are stealthing a bandit camp, and all is going well? BAM, a mercenary has tracked you, and is now on the lookout for you. Fighting some bandits loud? again, expect one of these guys to track you down, and help the enemies kill you. These guys are not to be messed with either, they are extremely tough, and you have to watch out what they do, because if you are unprepared, it can come back around on you VERY quickly. You guys who have played shadow of war before? This is pretty much the orc system, you climb the ranks, killing each orc (or in this case mercenary), as they get tougher and tougher, its very fun, and like i said before, makes the game interesting no matter what you are doing, hell, just roaming the map minding your own business then one can come and start a fight with you, its so good!

Ships make a great return after Black Flag, only this time, because its not cannons, i dont know, the archer shots don't feel as impactful as the sheer thunderous fury of the cannons Black Flag had to offer. BUT, having archers and javelin throwers rather than cannons makes sense due to the period its in, so i'm fine with this. The ship combat, is, well, it's Black Flag, what more is there to say, its spectacular, a TON of fun.

The rpg elements, is what really take this game into its own. They have added actual armour pieces that you can get, of different rarity, white (common) blue (rare) purple (epic) and orange/gold (legendary), as opposed to what origins had, where you had to scrounge for resources just to increase your hidden blade damage, or increase your hp, EVERYTHING, on origins, was tied to gathering resources, partly why i felt i had to force my way through it towards the latter half of the game just to say i have finished the it. This change alone, makes Odyssey worlds apart from Origins. How you upgrade your gear exaclty? Well, you find gear, as any rpg, but, you can choose to upgrade a piece that you like for an increasing amount of resources dependent on how many levels higher you are than the piece you want to upgrade. 

This is where the contreversy on Odyssey comes into play. Ubisoft, has added a store, from which, you can buy ""helix credits"", with said currency, you can buy resources. Now people who don't like to try before making an opinion, would scream ""PAY TO WIN TRASH, BOYCOTT UBISOFT FOREVER!"" I think the exact opposite. Not ONCE, have i ever thought, man, i could really do with buying a resource pack just to upgrade my gear. The conveyer belt of gear and resources, is consistant enough that you are never really short of XP, resources or gear. The only time, this gets troublesome? Is if you try and play the game, like the older AC games, as a linear, single player game, rather than an RPG. The oldschool AC players dont like the rpg change, because they can't blast through the game in two days, and these are also people, who think Ubisoft is vile and disgusting, for even hinting at putting this store in the game. Well guess what, you don't EVER need to buy any transactions on this game. if you do more than just the main story, do some exploring, check out the amazing side quests and contracts that are going on, you will never be short of resources or XP.

The side quests and story is amazing too, I dont want to get into too much detail as it would ruin the amazing work Ubisoft has done to create an engaging story, but take my word for it, it is great. The characters are great, especially Alexios and Kassandra, they are worlds apart from Origins' Bayek, who was about as interesting as watching paint dry. They are funny, and their emotions are very easily noticed, rather than, again, Bayeks' lack there of, emotions.

The difficulty settings, covers all ability types, easy is for the people who aren't entirely aware, or familiar of how RPG's work, this reduces the scaling that enemies have, meaning you can stick with the same gear for longer, and play it as more of a linear sp game, rather than an rpg, but making the game a tad boring for someone who likes having an rpg challenge. Normal, for the average rpg player, who know to get new gear, and how to semi-optimize their builds. Hard, is for hardcore rpg enthusiasts, where fully optimizing and min-maxing your build, is crucial if you want to even survive. And nightmare difficulty? I dont even know what to say, other than, good luck, you're going to need it.

Overall? easily a 9/10. I have so much fun with this game, the visuals are great, combat is spectaculay fun, the story is engaging, rpg elements make it interesting, same as mercenaries and the amazing characters puts a giant cherry on the cake. A must have for all rpg lovers, and AC fans, if you can get over actually having to do some preperation before you blast through the story. It's like every great game, put in one, Witchers intriguing story, Shadow of Wars orc system, Black Flags' ship combat, and the typical AC personality and feel. It's all here.

PS. The absolute best thing to do in this game? Spartan kick an enemy off a cliff, you feel so good afterwards.

Like how fleshed out the story is in comparison to the other AC games, you actually have some say in what your player character does and get to determine some aspects of how they interact with others. 

However i dont agree with the positioning of this game in relation to others in the series. Specifically the gameplay aspects. in this game, stealth as a playstyle is in many ways underwhelming. The first time you assassinate someone and he doesnt die within 1 hit, it literally is just the final push among many toward a warrior playstyle. The previous game Origins gave you some options, such as the predator bow which as you can imagine pretty much guarrranteed headshot kills on grunts, you didnt even need to consume points if you had the skill to aim. In this game your ability to stay hidden and compeletly decimate a base is hampered by the levelling system and the way in which gear is point first before the player initiative. 

This brings me to the 2 biggest gripes i have 1) lackluster character combat and 2) bland naval combat. By and large, for a hack and slash type combat its underwhelming by the standards of 2018, the things it tries to do are done alot better by other games in the same combat vein such as shadow of mordor, vampyr 2018, arkham series etc. most fights boil down to add fire/poison + kick/ram. The lack of executions, a combo bonuses and effective ways to deal with the hoards of enemies makes it less a combat encounter and more of a bore. The game pushes a very boring playstyle centering around 2 or 3 abilties plus very awkward keybindings. I think this may end up being the first AC game i dont finish.

The naval combat is perhaps the worst offender, for a game that has decided to be liberal with realisim, it walked back the interesting combat tools and replaced them with nothing. Its about as fun as an unlevelled ship in AC black flag, and less interesting than the naval combat sequences in Origins. 

All in all you still get the interesting setting, jaw dropping background, historical recreation of cities, but its lost its soul. It really need to revisit the levelling system. The stealth and combat gameplay should be  priorities that reward skillful play above whatever number is on the opppents head. Ubisoft have literally the most interesting naval gameplay implimented in their previous games and should revisit what made it interesting, the lack of offensive options is really felt if you have played the other titles. 

I cant recommend this purchase if you've played the other games and enjoyed them because thats not what you're getting. I cant really recommend it as an rpg cause its lackluster for a 2018 rpg. I cant even recommend it as a combat  centred game because there are other titiles that do what its trying to do loads better.

Though with Odyssey, I'm finding myself enjoying it to the point where I've played more than my usual 30-40 hours of a game before I get bored of it. (This is an alt account, so I don't have all my games on here.)

I enjoy that they brought back the sailing, and the map size is fantastic for just sailing around or exploring. 

The story is another great thing, there have already been a few times where I've teared up/cried due to the way the voice actors give their lines and due to the writers managing to give good lines to be used. 

The cult system and mercenary system are two wonderful additions that bring a lot to the game, even though they are new with a bit of problems (as to be expected), it doesn't take away from the experience in my opinion. You'll need to do a bit of work for uncovering the cultists, but its a journey that I find rather pleasant to go through. The mercenary thing is a love/hate, especially if you have a bounty and are trying to infiltirate a fortress, but only to have three high level merc's after your butt! I hate those moments, but enjoy them at the same time as it makes me regret doing some of those things to get my bounty... Though it doesn't stop me entirely.

I'm maybe 40% through the game, been running around doing side missions/exploring, but I can truely say this has been one of the more enjoyable AC games of the series in quite sometime, if they are able to keep this up then I'd become a fan all over again. 

All in all, I'm enjoying this game and hope that anyone else who might've been a fan in the past but not lately, give this one a chance whenver there is a sale. 80$ for a new game is a bit much for some people, understandably, but personally I believe its worth every penny if you are able to get the money together.

Plot: Odyssey is a big adventure that has its highs and lows but ultimately provides an enjoyable journey through Ancient Greece. The story is great, and the world is breathtaking, which is arguably the most important part of the game. Alexios or Kassandra, descendants of legendary spartan Leonidas, as they fight the Templars – a group of evildoers who continue to act as the series’ main antagonists, despite still forming throughout this instalment. I took on the role of Kassandra, who is easily the most charismatic and interesting of the two protagonists.

Gameplay: When dialogue fails to deliver, which it often does, her stellar portrayal and evident charm often times steal the show. How she behaves is decided by the player, with a handful of options available in all conversations. They normally follow a binary choice of good or evil, with many quests tasking you with killing an enemy or showing mercy and letting them go. Combat is an absolute blast, ripe with enough customisation for strategy that I didn’t grow bored of things. also bringing back the Naval Combat system is a bold idea done by ubisoft. A huge treat for fans who loves AC4 Black flag.  

Exploration: The Greek Islands is a frequent joy, and discovering new locations is encouraged as you surpass the level threshold required to conquer even the hardest of areas. They’re packed with an abundance of side quests and points of interest, although the latter become little more than busywork.

Overall, its a very good game . i can give it 8.5 / 10 !

Pros:

-Storyline is great with lots of well-written characters.
-Ship/Naval is great, one of the best parts of the game/
-Conquest Battles are a great way to earn xp, and sometimes you don't have to even trigger a conquest because they will just appear.
-Map looks big and annoying but is really enjoyable to roam around in.
-RPG elements are a great addition and add to the immersion.
-Combat is like The Witcher 3, it's quite smahsy but enjoyable.
-Game length is long so I recommend this game during a 'Game Drout'
-Side Quests are actually good and offer a good option.
-Areana Fighting is good.
-Crafting and Engraving is nice.

Cons:

-Horse mechanics is soemthing I don't understand, the horse goes erally slow in cities and on the borders but fast in the forests. Really annyoing.
-XP Grind/Levelling Up sytem is a really tedious task and 30% of my hours where grinding for XP and levels; the fact that story missions are locked behind stupid levels is dumb.
-Mercenary system is SO annoying and got me sooo angry during my time in this game. Mercenaries are allowed to walk into enemy camps  and be allowed but me as another mercenary cannot. They seem to know where you are and don't fuck off unless you either pay, which sometimes you can't or kill the sponsor.
-The Cult system is okay but again, is really tedious and locked behind dumb levels.
-Climbing is just the standard crap, not being able to clip onto certain things. Definitley an improvement but still not great.
-You are constantly bombarded by SOOO many items and they are usaully below your level or worse than the items you currently have equiped. This is probably the most annyoing thing, you are constanly having to go into your inventory and dismantle (YOU CAN'T EVEN DISMANTLE ITEMS BOUGHT FROM THE UBISOFT STORE; or legendary items in that case).
-They should of done a Skyrim type system with Sparta and Athens, where you chose your faction as opposed to fighting for Athens one day and Sparta the next.

Voice-acting by the main characters is amazing and done with passion, especially when you play as Kassandra! Though the voice-acting for the sidequests are less good, the reason why is because the same lines are used on almost every sidequest, but that's oke for me because creating new lines for every person you do sidequests for would take to long and be almost near impossible. I accept this, good work!

However:

1) Wooden ships without any gunpowder to be seen can explode like crazy by being hit with javelins or arrows, this is not right at all, it's repulsive. Very strange, it's almost like you're shooting cannons and you blow up their powder reserves (What??)

2) The combat is good, but if i am completely honest with you all, it gets pretty boring after a while and pretty fast at that. The same animations, varies between 5 of them or so. Not good enough for me.

3) RPG elements is a bit much, especially for an assassins creed game, numbers flying around while you hit people, skills that are completely unhuman and more fantasy is a turn off. Guided arrows?? Come on man! Exploding stomp on the ground where your enemies fly away as if they were made out of paper? Come on man! Make it at least a bit more reallistic. Good thing you can choose not to use those skills and also to turn off those freekin numbers flying everywhere, thank god!

4) I find it hard to accept that you're restricted to areas of your level, i want to explore the world but it is impossible to do so when you encounter a level 50 wolf that shreds you in a single hit. If they say this game is open world, they're not correct. The game is pretty linear when you look at it cause going anywhere you want is not an option!

5) The game is way to easy on normal so i really recommend a higher difficulty. Of course this is the players preference so i can't mark this as a bad thing, it's a good thing.

6) everything you can upgrade takes way to many resources and collecting these resources is a pain. I have to run around the world with my brains on level 0 and just shoot animals, which i dont like in the first place. Harvesting small little branches and veins, well rocks really, not veins. I don't even have the option to get a pickaxe and start mining or grab a woodaxe and chop trees for a more consistent flow of resource income. Terrible! What a grind!

Conclusion:

Overall it's a mediocre game and the story is oke, side-quests are pretty boring and tedious and the fact that they have a shop where you can spend real money is FUCKING DUMB!!

I'd say the game is good enough for maybe between 20-50 hours maximum. After that it gets boring, I'm bored of it at least and i didn't even hit the 20 hour mark yet...

I do not recommend buying this game if you're a veteran assassins creed player, if you're new to the franchise then please go ahead and buy it but know what you're up against. RPG fans will be very pleased with this game to, however I am not. Thumbs down on this one, sorry Ubisoft.

[Gameplay experience is for Nightmare difficulty][/h1]
Playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey is time well spent on with its fantastic and intriguing storytelling that'll keep you asking for what is next. You'll meet a whole lot of characters that have their own unique trait, there isn't a dull moment with any of the characters and plenty more praises to sing about this game but first let us talk about the CONS
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*][b]NO SPRINTING[/b]
- One of my biggest pet peeves in this game would be that you can't sprint. This in turn would make your horse a necessity however you cannot control when your horse sprints. It struts in cities gallops outside and only sprints on the open road. Horses that you mount can then be killed by wild animals if they are fast enough to strike.
[*][b]CRIME DETECTION IS UNREASONABLE[/b]
- In AC: Odyssey when you are seen stealing and murdering inside towns and cities you get a bounty on your head that's well and good however. When you commit these acts and you didn't leave any witnesses like straight up everybody is dead. The bounty would remain. Specially when destroying military supplies and no one has seen you do it, you still get a bounty.
[*][b]PERFORMING ANOTHER STEALTH ATTACK TAKES TOO LONG[/b]
- In Odyssey, you can sneak up and do a stealth attack on an enemy, if that didn't kill the enemy, in order to do another stealth attack you have to hide and wait until the enemy stops searching which takes a long time. Shouldn't it be available to do as soon as you are hidden? Why do we have to wait until the enemy gives up on searching for us to perform another stealth attack?
[*][b]GOING OUT OF THE STORY TO THE MODERN WORLD SUCKS[/b]
- This is due to the fact that i don't understand how the assassin's creed game works. I assume they also jump in and out of historical events like some sort of VR headset in the other Assassin's Creed games so for me to keep experiencing that is kind of a hindrance to story progression of the ancient greek times. It happens only a few times but i didn't like it nonetheless.

[h1]RECOMMENDATIONS:[/h1]
[list]
[*]CLEAR EVERYTHING
- This is how you can get Vaulable Engravings which you need to enchance your gear with. You also unlock hidden side quests, get a lot of exp and find all sorts of loot which you will need to equip or sell
[*]DON'T FINISH THE MAIN QUEST FIRST
- Take your time, explore the world the more interactions you experience the better the story progresses.
[*]ALWAYS SCOUT ENEMIES USING IKAROS
- Your ship needs strong lieutenants with top notch skills, always be on the look out press V and scout over elite enemies knock them out and then recruit them, your going to be doing a lot of naval battles, so you best be prepared
[*]PICK EVERYTHING UP
[*]ALWAYS KILL/RECRUIT THE MERCENARIES HUNTING YOU
[*]Z IS AUTO RUN
[*]HOLDING Z WHEN YOU'RE ON A HORSE AND PRESSING E WHILE ON THE ROAD WILL COMMENCE AUTOPATH TO YOUR MARKED LOCATION
[*]HAVING SEX WITH EVERYONE IS THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION

[*]As a sequel to Origins, it really doesn't do much to improve on it. The game looks near identical, high end beauty tweaks aside, which I honestly haven't noticed myself, but have been told exist. It plays the same. They even remove some of the fun bits like the berserk dart and fire bombs, but don't really replace them. The skill tree and choice of active skills are good, but I personally had more fun just chucking bombs at unaware people.
[*]The addition of a few choices that change nothing don't make it an RPG. There are a few choices that carry over to the ending, so you have to be careful if you want to get the 'good' ending. Everything else is entirely self-contained, as in your choice is meaningless outside the instant you make it, as when the quest ends, neither those characters nor the results of the quest are shown nor mentioned again. There was one exception I can remember, with a girl who wanted you to get jewelry for her friends. It was ambient dialogue, but it's fine, it existed, that was all I wanted.
[*]The story is meandering and I'm honestly gonna stop playing at this point, because I'm bored with it. No story quest is straightforward, in that if I do the story quests, it's not necessarily going to be story related. Every story quest that has some good stuff, expository dialogue, a cutscene or two, a new character... is prefaced by 3 pointless quests. Go kill X, go fetch Y, investigate Z... it's pointless, when he tells you what it is, you [i]know[/i] it's pointless, there's just no option to say 'nah, gimme the good stuff'. You can refuse the quest, but you can also not do the story and by extension, not play the game.
[*]The basic themes of the franchise, the hood, the hidden blade, the creed, are all gone, which makes it kinda directionless. It's an assassin's creed game, yet there's no assassin or creed. You assassinate people, sure, but you also leap from tall buildings into haystacks despite taking zero fall damage, so I'm unclear whether the assassination mechanism was left in cause they wanted to use it or cause people would riot if it was gone.
(I am aware that it's a prequel to the origins of the assassins. I didn't ask them to make that the setting though.)
[*]The microtransactions cross the line. The game is designed to be P2W, in that the store straight up sells a permanent exp and gold boost, for a third of the game's price. The gear pieces that are sold in the store all have direct damage boosts as legendary affixes, for example, increases damage at the cost of health. Of the gear in-game, I can think of one spear which does that. You're given 200 helix credits (the store currency), for no discernible gameplay reason, but the legendary gear all starts at 250, and you can't buy anything below 500 credits in one go. They just [i]constantly[/i] nudge you towards it, and it gets annoying.
[*]The repetitive bits are needlessly grindy. There's a cult you're hunting as part of the game's story. Each branch of the cult has 5 members, each dropping a piece of legendary gear, with each branch corresponding to one themed set of legendary gear. So you're encouraged to seek them out for non-story purposes. The problem isn't killing them though. It's finding and/or reaching them. One cultist needed me to do every side quest in a zone before he would show up. The final side quest didn't even mention him in any way, yet the clue to identify him magically appeared in my inventory. Cultists, even of the same branch, will be several in-game miles away from each other, often at opposite ends of the map. The leader of one branch (each group of 5 has a 6th, their leader) was in the opposite corner from his (former) subordinates, which at that point was expected. The thing was, that he was in the middle of the open sea. In that there was no habitable land anywhere near him. I don't know what he was doing there or why, given that they still had to communicate via traditional means, so isolating yourself was a bad idea. I do know I spent 10 minutes doing nothing while sailing to him. Which is the real issue - dead time. Most of my time spent hunting this cult has been dead time, alt tabbing while riding my horse or ship. It's boring. I want the gameplay to be interesting, not padded out.

I haven't played an Assassins Creed game since Revelations... I am happy to get back into this series. All of the Assassin's Creed games I played prior had a really easy combat system, you counter, you kill, and repeate until the 1000 people are dead. I'm glad to say this isn't the case in Odyssey and with the level, gear, and skill system it makes the combat much harder and more diverse than ever. You feel like you're an actual person this time, not a god with godlike fighting skills that no one can rival. You'll have to pay close attention to the enemies to know when to block, dodge, or use a skill. There is no counter attack that will block the attack then instantly kill the enemy anymore, unless it's a skill I haven't seen yet. MAJOR improvement here in my opinion, and the old combat system was one of the reasons I grew bored of the series.

Now for something bad. I know the game was just released on the 5th, but it really needs more optimization. Frame rates are not consistant and I feel they were over ambishious with the level of detail in the game. A GTX 1070 has to play on Medium/High to get a consistent 60 FPS on 1440p, and even then you'll be dropping into the low 50's at times. What really seems to have the biggest FPS hit are the Volumetric Clouds. Simply changing the option from High to Medium can increase performance by up to 35%. I set it to low because I don't spend much time looking at the sky and clouds anyway. I suggest you all do the same so that you can put that GPU power to something more important that you'll actually be paying attention to.

Cons:
- No point in the out-of-Animus characters, story, etc. Just wastes time listening to it.
   * You get to step out of the Animus at times only to walk around in a small room with small, useless things to examine. 
      Most of them just yield bad puns/jokes from your character upon examination.
- There is a level grind. I don't mind it, but a lot of users seem to despise it.
- No more parkour puzzles. Everything is capable of being climbed on! There should've been some sort of limitation to force players to think about how they're going to engage or get away from enemies.
- You're not even an Assassin. The Creed doesn't even exist for some few-hundred-years.

 Pros
-this time around they got the PC controls right in my opinion, didn't need a controller like I did in Origins
-story is very well written and the pacing is pretty good
-lots of interesting characters with intersting personalities and quests
-the combat has a little more depth to it this time around and for a small gold fee you can respec almost anytime or anywehere through the ability menu
-Loot! lots of loot, there are only so many sets and like Skyrim they are just renamed or recolored for certain ""uniques"" but still plenty of loot and styles to choose from
-ship battles and sailing in general is a lot of fun with lots of options to upgrade and customize your ship
-Combat is a bit better than origins and fun a majority of the time
-the landscapes, enviroments, and their designs are some of the best of any game I've ever seen. Far more variety than origins. I haven't unlocked all of the map yet and I've almost every biome you can think of! The devs deserve praise for how beautiful this game looks

Cons
-hit detection is some of the worst for bows, just use atuo aim. On massive beasts that tower over you you'll miss even though your crosshair is directly on their massive body but not on the tiny spot that makes the crosshair turn red. Needs to be fixed, makes the bow frustraiting at times. 
-HUD, I'd like to see more options for customizing the HUD from size, position to opacity. Its clear the devs took time to give some options to make the game as immersive as possible but i think they need to take it farther. I personally don't enjoy a lot of HUD or floating icons that I can see from 300+M away in my vision at all times. 
-I didn't mind the pacing of the game but some will consider it a grind, if you just do some side quests you shouldn't have to grind too much to finish the main story. But some will consider it a grind and a con im sure. 
-Major con here, PERFORMANCE: Fog and Clouds turn both down to save a lot of wasted FPS. I ran all settings as high as they could go with Fog on low and Clouds on high. 
-FPS was 42-60 with a capped fps to 60fps but CPU usage is very high for like no reason as per usual. The API needs revised for these games on PC.",True,1540058657,1540059163,True,0,0,0,False

Assassin's Creed Odyssey builds heavily on the momentum of Origins, with improvements across almost all aspects of gameplay. Furthermore, we get some classic Assassin's Creed content back, while new features are introduced. This all contributes to a gameplay experience that still feels like Assassin's Creed while leaning towards a more choice-based role-playing game like Mass Effect.

Right away I was happy that I was able to choose my character rather than the silly switching mechanic of Syndicate. This is a good move for story and character building. I chose Kassandra as I have always had an affinity for a strong female character. Kassandra is a very well-designed character with a great backstory and a personality shaped by her history and experiences. As a mercenary, she's also very different than any characters we've seen before, but would probably be closest to Kenway in terms of motivations.

Still, now that we get to choose how our character interacts with others, I feel like I have a real choice in how my Kassandra views herself and the world. Sometimes the choices are simple and rather meaningless, but other times I feel like I have great freedom in how I interact with others. A personal example is a quest in which I was asked to forge a signature so an individual could gain citizenship to Athens, and then you are asked to find a man to serve as witness. Upon meeting this man, you find out that the person trying to gain citizenship has previously given information to the opposing forces for money and that the man refuses to be a witness to such an individual. You are then given the choice to threaten the man with violence, pay him off with Drachmae, or to agree with his view that the citizenship should not be granted. I very much enjoyed that the options all had their own consequence.

The world in Odyssey is quite massive, and the terrain is believable for the locale. We get the large continental Greek world while also having a series of islands to explore. Travel can be a bit more difficult than Origins just due to the more mountainous terrain. I find myself foregoing my horse and either running or utilising fast travel options more often.

There is just so much to do in this game. Each region has many different types of quests ranging from long story-based options to simple contracts. Much like Origins, you'll see hundreds of question marks on the map of various camps and locales to explore. We also get the ship battles and mechanics back from Black Flag with some fun additions.

Resource management has improved as well. In Origins, resources were only used to upgrade gear and then you didn't really need them anymore. With Odyssey, your resources are not only used for much more, but the new engraving system for gear means that you can continue to use those resources to customise your gear however you choose.

Another really exciting addition is the new Mercenary system. Origins built this initially as a few mean brutish types trying to hunt you, but Odyssey completely revamps this into a whole workable system. With the new wanted meter, (Grand Theft Auto style), mercenaries will only come after you if the gauge starts to go up. Once they try to hunt you, they have no qualms about screwing up your missions and making your life end quickly. There are so many more of them, and each have their own interesting mechanics. Some are nimble and will dance around you, while others are heavy types with massive weapons that will try to smash you. Some will use fire and poison while others will have an animal companion. Hell, there's even one with a battle chicken! Killing these mercenaries is always a fun challenge that rewards you with some exciting loot, or you can even recruit them as a lieutenant on your ship! If your wanted meter gets too high, then you may have more than one actively trying to hunt and kill you at the same time.

The updates to the battle system introduce a new challenge as well, with a resource system that you spend on abilities. With things such a a healing ability and devastating damage options, this sometimes make battle quite a bit easier, but it also means that you need to spend your resources wisely. No more will you be able to shoot Predator arrows at everyone to kill them from a distance, because your gauge will run out and the only way to fill it is to fight or assassinate the good ol' fashioned way. The new region battles are truly exciting too. It makes me feel like I am in a real battle scenario, with chaos and death all around you.

Lastly, one more thing I enjoy is the small interactions with the NPCs and environment. Some cool examples of things I have seen so far:

[list]
[*]A guard came upon a heap of bodies that had been burned to ash and proceeded to vomit.
[*]I accidentally released a Bobcat while fighting a mercenary and the cat decided to attack the mercenary instead of me. The cat didn't last for very long but it helped me knock a bit of health from the unlucky lady, who met her end soon after.
[*]Guards going off-duty will hang up their weapons at the nearest rack, while guards coming back on duty will grab their weapon from the rack.
[*]I was moving into a camp to kill some bandits but a bear got to them before I did. I still got credit for the quest, and then one-shot killed the bear since his health was so low.
[/list]

As a long-time Assassin's Creed fan, (since the original game so long ago), and as one who mostly gave up on it all after the Unity/Rogue debacle, I was pleasantly surprised to see Origins re-invent the series into something much greater, and now Odyssey moves forward more with improvements and choices that will continue to carry the series forward.

If you have played otherAC games, forget about them. Odessy is nothing like them. Odessy is a breath of fresh air and the start fo what is going to be an amazing new year of gaming. I really do not want to do this review because I want to get back into the game... It's that good. Not only are the graphics crazy good and the voice overs and onscreen performances freakishly awesome but the game is ENORMOUS. I'm talking just as big if not a little bigger than The Witcher 3. Its one of the biggest games I have ever played. Some people are saying that it is to big... Naaaa... A game for me can never be too big. Especially an open world, RPG lite game like AC: Odessy. Did I say that the game is beautiful! OMG (I'm 40 and I NEVER say OMG, that how beautiful it is) This game is one of the prettiest game I have ever played. It does rival The Witcher 3 in scenery' AC: Orgins was good, but geezus was it sandy. Odessy is something to marvel at. The game is super rich in color and enviornment. A lot of open world games that look good have copy and paste enviornments. While Odessy does have copy and paste graphics... You can not tell. Sure there are familiar looking carts, piles of leaves and trees, but they are spaced far enough apart that you do not care. Greek cities are bustling with citizens and busy bodies that really do give you the feel of walking around ancient Greece. Markets are full of bright red bushels of apples, purple and pink flowers, bales of vegitables, carts of fish... Its indescribable. Loot is also a plenty in Odessy. This AC game has an RPG lite feel to it when it comes to loot and armor... There is A LOT of it and it be found everywhere. If you steal it or leave it is the question? Stealing it will get you trouble and put on a hit list. Not only is the map big but there are quests riddled all over it. I am 32 hours in and I have only just gotten started. Just when I thought that I knew what was going on I would be thrown for a loop and the game would get that much bigger. Bigger in ways that I do not want to spoil, but let me just say this. Odessy is the most interesting AC game as of yet. Its plot is familiar but thick and twisty in very intriguing ways. Ways that make me not want to quit playing. When I heard about the next AC game being set in ancient Greece, I was a little upset. I am just itching for a more modern approach to AC... The guns and cool spy gear that a modern day Assassin would carry paired up with a trek through a bustling and busy city while driving any one of a huge selection of very cool sports cars just seems crazy cool to me. Plus Orgins was cool and all, but it was just to... Sandy and kind of boring. Thinking it over I decided to give Odessy a chance and man am I glad I did. Its keeping me busy with interesting quests that each offer their own set of awesome rewards. Your Gear is set up similar to Orgins but on a larger scale. Head gear, arm gear, leg gear and torso are all separate now and when you get in the higher levels you can take full sets and mix and match them to make some really neat combinations. Your weapons haven'treally changed much except for that you can now craft several different types of arrows than can be swapped in and out with different bow strikes. Leveling up has changed a little but in ways that are much appreciated. You now have several different offensive attacks that you can choose to level up. All of wich can be swapped in and out very easily. The end game attacks are extremely powerful and when used correctly can be used to take out multiple enimies at a time with ease.

In total there are three major arc, family, cult, and Atlantis. I personally think player should finish cult first before Atlantis. The story flows much more smoother this way. Atlantis focuses Kassandra's role on the assassin series and serves as a stepping stone for the modern days arc. Not the best story out there, but definitely an interesting one. Atlantis in my opinion is the true ending of the game. A closure for Kassandra.

0,463,26,6552,0,76561197987534120,0,english,False,45356016,"Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great open world action RPG. That's really all you need to know if you like that type of game and haven't played it's predecessor Assassin's Creed Origins. The game is stacked to the brim with content, it's large, deep and engrossing all the way through the many dozens of hours it will take you to finish this game. It has a well-executed RPG side to it and whether you like exploring, questing or just doing the main story the game will keep you entertained throughout. The game is beautiful with the greek world being absolutely massive and seeming very alive, there's an incredible amount of content far beyond Origins and the entire game is well-crafted and exactly what you would expect from a 60€ price tag. I can say without doubt that it is completley worth it.

However comparing it to it's predecessor Assassin's Creed Origins is only natural, because frankly the game feels very much like a direct evolution of that game. In some ways it is improved, in some ways it is a step back. 

The game has progressed immensely in the RPG department. Where Origins took baby steps towards turning the Assassin's Creed franchise into a Witcher-style RPG, Odyssey takes it the rest of the way. With 5 armor slots, including the addition of legendary set bonuses, the ability to customize your equipment with passive bonuses from so-called engravings and side quests that have dialogue options and choices with meaningful consequence, the game has taken the leap from sort-of RPG to full-blown open world RPG. And it works well.

The side quests are mostly engaging, although some are simple fetch quests, the main story has some incredibly difficult choices and the loot-game is great, keeping you constantly searching for that one item to complete your set bonus. However, not all RPG aspects are improved from Origins. The skill tree has more skills that are simply numerical upgrades, it has less interesting paths overall and it lacks a place to dump infinite points, possibly leaving you with a bunch of unspent skillpoints at the endgame, if you're running a very linear build. There is a lot of room for builds too, with several elemental damage types and three distinct types of damage that can be stacked for bows, melee and stealth assassination. This combines with some interesting effects on armor sets and legendary weapons to create an enjoyable levelling experience, though I do think Origins did the skill trees better.

The game also has an incredible non-linear part in which you can hunt down members of the antagonistic Cult in any order you like; a newfound freedom which is a very welcome addition to an assassination focused franchise. However this is probably the highlight of the story-part of the game, as the rest feels like a major downgrade from Origins. While the main character is charismatic, the villains are numerous but uninteresting and without depth and the story beats are forgettable. It feels like the assassination part of the franchise was almost completely stripped out this time around, as while you do assassinate lots of people, it is rarely in the style of previous games where you would be going around an area looking for the perfect opportunity to take down your target, whom you'd been hearing about for hours. Instead villains come and go constantly and most of them you never even speak to, especially since the trippy post-assasination dialogue the franchise is known for is altogether missing this time around. And if you like the real-world meta plot of Assassin's Creed you will be sorely disappointed as I can say without spoilers that it is barely advanced throughout the entirety of the game. In my opinion this is the biggest downside of Odyssey as compared to Origins; the story was much better the last time around as here it feels more like an afterthought, and the ending definitely does not feel like an ending. I'm excited to see where it goes in DLC, but as it is here the story is simply not all that interesting, but is salvaged by the incredible depth and engagement of the side content.

Ship combat also returns in a major way, as you will be travelling around in your ship a lot. It does feel less deep than something like Assassin's Creed 4 though, with the absence of legendary ships and fortresses to take down. On top of this the upgading of the ship is in form of pure statistical bonuses with very little choice or customization. While the ship could have been an interesting gameplay element, ultimately it is mostly just a means of transport. If they plan to keep the ship around, I wish they would do more with it in future installments.

In conclusion the game is great. The enormous well of content and the many deep RPG mechanics keep this game going strong all the way to the conclusion, but the story is nothing special and the game takes some steps back from Assassin's Creed Origins. I loved he Cult system and enjoyed exploring as well as levelling and gearing up, but in future installments I would like to see them expand the skill trees, work more on the story and bring back the old-school Assassin's Creed assination. As it stands though the game is still an easy recommendation for anyone who looks open world RPGs; just make sure you're more pulled in by the action-stealth gameplay, and less by the story of it all.",True,1540038412,1540038412,True,0,0,0,False

I want to say I’m not a fan of the Assassin’s Creed series. I can’t get into any of them. At least until now. This game is addicting. You can easily lose hours when playing. The world is massive and detailed. This game takes heavy inspiration from great RPG titles like Witcher 3 for combat, and Dragon Age for player choices. The item system is very similar to games like Destiny, where you always want to get better loot as you level up. 
The amount of content is INSANE. You can do story quests, side quests, bounties, take down a cult, climb the mercenary ladder (similar to nemesis system in Shadow of Mordor), sail etc. There has been complaints about a grind, however considering the amount of activities to do it doesn’t feel like a grind since you earn xp for almost anything you do. The combat is extremely similar to Witcher 3’s system, except spells are replaced with abilities that can be bought with skill points. Weapon types all have a different feel and play style. Stealth is still a big part of the game, as getting surrounded by many enemies can make a hard fight.
Negatively the game is very cpu heavy. I generally run 60-80 FPS with a GTX 1080 and i7-7700k at Ultrawide 1440p. I’ve had many times where the frames would suddenly dip down to the teens. I’ve also had some bugged side quests.

Adding fun little references like the Spartan Kick was a stroke of genius.
Been playing for over 70 hours now, max lever (50), not completed the main mission yet, too much to do.
This has elements of AC, The Witcher, and Mass Effect rolled into a fun little action/sneak game.

Story is in my opinion much better. The greek mythology, which I love, helps it even more.
This isn't about the Templars vs the Assasins kind of Creed game, this explain the ISU, the predecessors.
I always wanted to know more about them and this gives alot of information.

So if you have read complaints how this is not a real AC game, that is wrong, it just leaves out the middle man.
The game is amazing where you have a ton of sidequests, you have your ship back, fully upgradable and with crew (you can customize both ship and crew too). You are immerced in Greek lore, while revealing ancient ISU lore.
You have CHOICES, where some are quite important ones, others less so but it feels more immersive.

Only complaint albeit a small one is the lackluster hunter tree.
During Origins I plays as a hunter, and this time around, I barely even touched the bow.
It's not bad mind you, it just feels less useful compared to the other 2 skill trees (fighter and assasin).

If you liked Origins, you will love this, it's bigger and it's better.

I feel like Ubisoft is unable to make a game with challenging mechanics so instead they make boss fights that last 30 mins because they have 2 billion life points and a damage output that kills you in 1 or 2 hits.  Oh and btw what is the point of leveling in an rpg if everything levels with you. You never get any feeling of progression this is NOT an online game Ubisoft. Oblivion tried that in 2006 and most of the players hated it. 

On another topic the war between Sparta and Athen is barely touched, it feels like every gameplay element they put in here ( the conquest battle) were an afterthought when they realized nothing in this game felt like a war. The way that you get to a conquest battle is moronic. You can kill hundreds of Spartans for example and still help them when its time for battle they dont care at all, in fact, nobody in this game cares about what you do. When you get into the battle its not even fun you just run around looking for captains to kill.

Most of the game is yet again a Ubisoft grind fest that is more like a bunch of check-boxes than actual quests. I'll say this though at least with the new rpg oriented gameplay there is a little (very little) incentive to do these garbages activities for xp, money and ressources, that is better than the olds AC's pre Origin.

I can't believe they were dumb enough not to include shields for the player's character. They said they wanted a fast paced combat system but they didn't need to change anything in fact they could have just made the time window for a parry a little longer when you wear a shield you dont have to allow the player to always parry. I just wanted to look like a badass Spartan Hoplite but i can't.

Pros: The game is beautiful, the armor sets look amazing and there is very little of the modern day storyline.

In my opinion this is the best Assassin's Creed since Assassin's Creed Black Flag. ACO is a gorgeous game with quite a bit of depth. There's so much more to do and experience than prior AC titles. The world is absolutely massive and detailed beautifully. I've found myself completely immersed in the era and attached to the protagonist. I would get lost sometimes for hours just exploring and taking awesome screenshots with the Assassin's Creed Photo Mode, which freezes time in game. This allows you to free-roam with your camera around your character to take fantastic pictures. The combat in this game does take some getting used to, it's completely  revamped from the last AC title I played (Syndicate). That being said, once you get it down, the combat is so fun and satisfying. There is also a new crime penalty system. Basically there's all these very strong mercenaries, and if you commit a crime in sight of civilian or soldier, you will accumulate a bounty. With enough witnessed crimes, these powerful mercenaries will come for you to claim that bounty, all with their own traits, skills and sometimes furry companions. Depending how much bounty you have acquired you can have 1-5 of these guys coming after you. They will show up wherever you are randomly which can get you in some tough situations if you're in the middle of a mission. The sea battles are quite fun, I was hesitant about it with the lacking of cannons but it's amazingly fun. All in all, very fun and interesting mechanics. If you like Assassin's Creed, any of them, or a fan of the historical setting, this is the game for you. 

Goods-
- Combat system and skill specialization (Hunter, Warrior, Assassin).
- Sea battles are extremely fun.
- Graphics are beautiful.
- Runs flawless on my average PC.
- Play in a world where you can easily lose yourself in a historically epically immersive experience.
- The new bounty system.
- Campaign has been great and enticing. (I'm about half-way through the story at the time of this review)
- Assassin's Creed Photo Mode.

Bads- 
- Ubisoft’s microtransaction store
- Friends and family will hate how much time you end up losing playing this game.

Players use swords, spears, and bows to kill enemy soldiers and bandits in melee-style combat. Players also use stealth attacks (e.g., knife stabbing) to dispatch enemies discreetly. Large blood-splatter effects occur as enemies are killed. A handful of cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence and/or gore: characters stabbed through the head/neck with bladed weapons; young characters thrown off a cliff; a man mauled by a mob as his arm gets thrown into the air. Some environments depict severed limbs and dismembered corpses on the ground. The game contains instances of sexual material: characters kissing and caressing before the screen fades to black (sex is implied though never shown); dialogue referencing sex and prostitution (e.g., “Anything goes in this sex andron”; “That is love, this is commerce.

[h1]The good[/h1]

- [b]The graphics are superb.[/b] Yes, the visuals don't disappoint. There are some rigging flaws here and then with dead bodies, but absolutely nothing that makes the landscapes ugly. Actually, I think it's really fun to see those random pile of bones in weird positions when they're on the ground--it makes me laugh.

- [b]The game is responsive.[/b] Hell yeah, there's nothing to complain about responsiveness. You click and the feedback is instantaneous. I'm a true fan of The Witcher, but to me, horsehiding on this title is superior in so many ways, not to mention the combat smoothness.

- [b]The voice acting is brilliant.[/b] I'm playing with Kassandra, and her voice is just adorable and well interpreted. You can feel there's expression.

- [b]The sea combat is insanely fun.[/b] Hell yeah, if you like ships, go ahead because this is a true gem.

- [b]The immersion is present.[/b] Thanks to all the well crafted environment and details, I must say the immersion is real. You get into the game and that universe that you forget the clock is ticking in the real world. If you like the Greek mythology and aesthetics, this game is for you.

- [b]The map is HUGE.[/b] Yeah, HUGE. It'd take you hours and hours to explore every piece of that world.

- [b]The storyline is engaging.[/b] It's not the most original thing out there, but hey, you really want to go on. Sum this with an immersive, beautiful world and you have all you need to beat this game.

[h1]The neutral[/h1]

- [b]Still an RPG wannabe.[/b] Though the game brought some RPG elements to its design--lots of them were borrowed from The Witcher,--I think it's still not mature enough. The decisions you make aren't that important; the major part of your quests are linear in that ""kill someone; bring me these items""  fashion; the territory conquest is completely not immersive--regardless of the side you choose to help, the other doesn't turn against you. In general, I'm pretty sure in the next title they'll polish these things more, but for now if you're looking for a true RPG experience, stay away from this title.

- [b]Combat feels simple and easy.[/b] I'm playing on the hard difficulty and can't feel any difficulty at all. Also, there's a lack of variety on how you can deal with your enemies. I don't mean diversity on how to kill them, but I feel the combat is always the same thing; the same movements, etc.

[h1]The bad[/h1]

- [b]Universe scalability sucks.[/b] Unsure why Ubisoft took this decision of making the world scale with you (maybe to sell microtransitions?), but no matter how you evolve, the enemies around you will always be close to your level. For an online experience it might make sense--because balancing must be taken into account--, but for an offline experience? Seriously? To illustrate this situation if you didn't get the point: you're level 1, the weakest creatures will be level 1 as well. Your level raised to 5, then those same creatures will be level 5. It makes us feel we haven't grow. That sensation of powerfulness and progression is totally not present here.

[h1]Veredict[/h1]

If you are looking for a true RPG, stay away. If you're looking for an ordinary AC with tons, yet shallow, RPG elements in a Greek environment with beautiful graphics, sound and an interesting storyline, no doubt this one is for you.

By and Far the best in the series since Black Flag. The story takes a little while to get going but once it does, you wont want to put it down! I love the added dialogue choices that allow you to have a personal touch in your game. Also, choices you make change the world around you and lead to some interesting events and consequences! You'll spend hours just exploring the world and finding all sorts of adventures to get in to! 

People complaining about an ""XP Wall"" dont seem to understand that RPG's arent meant for you to just beeline down the main story path and do nothing else. There is a whole world in this game. Go explore it! I finished the game at about 40 hours at level 45 after having done some side quests and the main story arc and never once hit an ""XP Wall"". You should expect when you buy any action adventure or rpg type game that it WILL take at MIN 30-40 hours to complete.

A side note:
Yes, the game has microtransactions. These come in the form of XP and money boosts, Mount, ship and armor skins, crafting materials and  a few low level weapons. In a single player game where they are telling you up front EXACTLY what youre getting (not hiding it as a chance in a loot box), i dont think this is the worst thing ever. You dont HAVE to buy it and if you do, it doesnt affect ANYONE but you.

Is this Assassin's Creed? I can already tell you it's not. 
Is this game a good RPG so far? Yes.
Is the gameplay features such as the spartan kick cool? Fuck yes it is.

Game is not Assassin's Creed, should of been it's own new franchise from Ubisoft.

Graphics are the same as Origins.

I've been playing the Assassins Creed series for quite a while now. They have kept the gameplay pretty consistent throughout the years. Depending on who you ask, it has been both a blessing and a curse.

In my opinion, Ubisoft's lack of innovation started to go downhill ever since Assassin's Creed Black Flag. This led me to turn away from the franchise for a while, seeking different genres and styles, hoping that they will eventually come back with something new and exciting... and so ladies and gentlemen, they finally have.

At first glance, Assassin's Creed Odyssey may not seem all that different from previous releases. Once you play it, you will find that it takes the old gameplay, combines, and transforms it in a very different and satisfying way. Old gameplay mechanics can be felt, but Odyssey introduces a few twists in combat, progression, and especially a well needed turn in quests and story telling.

I'm trying to keep my review relatively short and sweet so I will not go over every change and detail, but know this.

Buy this game full price! SO WORTH EVERY PENNY! Note: running GTX980ti- do not optimize using GeForce. Set everything to max! Then set resoultion (in game) to 140% and set AA to low.

If you set AA to off, you'll use more GPU resources (strangly) So to summarize, Set all graphics settings to Ultra/MAX except resoultion to 140% and AA to low (NOT OFF). You should be at 40-60 fps.

TL;DR:
9/10 - Will keep you entertained for 50+ hours

In Odyssey, you're not exactly an ""Assassin"", you're a Spartan Mercenary, and being an Assassin is entirely up to you. You can be a Warrior, or an Assassin. You can charge in sword drawn first and fight hand to hand with your opponents, or you can sneak around and stealth 'most' of your enemies away. When I say 'most' I mean most elite enemies cant be instant killed through stealth. There is no hidden blade, you weild a dagger, which acts as your secondary weapon.

The game is very long, and its structured in a way similar to a blend of Assassin's Creed, Shadow of War, and Witcher 3.
The questing, equipment and combat will remind you a bit of Witcher 3, the way the world is structured, the parkour and the naval combat will remind you of AC, and the progression systems and Mercenary system will remind you of the Nemesis engine of Shadow of War.

The game is designed to be quite long, where there are many main story archs that merge into one, leveling up can be slow and you are required to do some side-questing/ world exploration to keep your level and equipment up to the main story standards. Your Character level, your Spear (Hidden Blade), your Ship, your Gear, your main story archs, the Arena fights, the Mercenary roster, and hunting Cultists are all designed to be progressed slowly to the end game. You'll spend alot of time, and hours trying to complete everything.

The entire game takes place between the civil war of greece between the Spartans and Athenians. You can influence the war effort by aiding either side. Clearing out Forts, destroying/burning supplies and stealing resources will lower the influence of that particular faction in the area. Even killing random guards will slowly lower it. Eventually you can expose the areas ""leader"" and assassinate him/her. As the influence weakens you'll notice more and more of the opposing factions soldiers attacking and raiding the land, and eventually, weakend enough, you can spark the ""Conquest"" battle, which is an all out battle on foot between the two sides. Siding with the attacking team will always be more difficult of a battle, but will grant higher rewards... and whatever side victors will change the rule of that state.

The Conquest battles are fun, but they are all the same. After you've completed a few, they become nothing more than a method of getting some up to date Epic equipment. Basically the conquest is an all out battlefield between the two factions. You're the Hero of whatever side you're on, and there will be a Hero on your opponents side that you will likely have to fight halfway through the battle. Your job is to deplete the enemy teams forces, kill their Captains and their Hero, and demoralize them enough that the remaining troops on the field retreat.

Some of you have probably heard this game is ""Grindy"".... yes and no. Its not any more of a Grind than any typical RPG. Its just that you now have access to the UbiStore, where you can ""Pay-to-progress"". This is whats getting everyone's jimmies rustled. YOU DONT HAVE TO PAY TO WIN. Ignore the UbiStore and play the game normally. 
This isnt like Shadow of War where the end-game becomes obscenely difficult you have to pay money to boost. No the game is consitant, it might be consitantly slow, but it is consistan.

The main protagonist (I chose Kassandra for the record) is not a ""bastion of light"" and feels human and relatble, which is great.

When I played Origins, I applauded it for its improvements in side quests. So I expect Odyssey to do better in the side quest department, sadly that’s not the case.

This game is pretty like Origins if not prettier.. But that’s about it. For the first time of all the AC titles that I have played, I felt like I didn’t have a purpose to clear off each interest point. Apart from the main story and some of the more meaningful side quests. All else is but markers on the map for you to clear it off. Well you might argue that previous AC titles were the same, it has always been this way. Yes! I agree but for me it didn’t really make sense, In Odyssey I am a mercenary but why would I go about killing everyone? Both Spartan and Athenian ? And in cities, why would I want to kill off random leaders.

Unless at the very beginning, the game make us choose a side and from there we would have determined our enemy and the killing would make sense. Unless I accept a quest to kill somebody or clear a fort or something I feel like an insane person killing everyone who didn’t matter whenever I stumble upon an interest point. And FYI these interest points sometimes are densely packed. 

I ended up avoiding clearing many of the interest points like army camps and leader houses because it didn’t make sense to me. For the cultists I wouldn’t hesitate to murder them because it make sense since they are the real bad guys here...

I don’t know really, at this point I am just doing the main and unique side stories. The bounties, contracts and procedural generated or timed events are chores and boring AF.

The combat is set up in a way where you can kinda make up your own combos, to which i have adopoted the staff and battleaxe in such a manner that im basically unhittable.

So naturally i literally murder my way across Greece cutting down spartans and athenians or any merc who deicides a bit of coin is worth dying for.

Odyssey is the most fun ive had in an Assassin's creed game, but not because of it having anything to do with assasins or creeds, but instead as some psycopathic merc who somehow becomes the Hero after murdering an entire city.

If I had to qualify this game, it would be a ""The witcher 3 / Farcry / Dark souls / Assassin's creed"" game and it's working really good together. I had a LOT of fun playing this, there is many content (40h rushing the main quest, and there is 20-40h more for everything else). 

Pro : 

- Actualy a good story (I even reloaded a save 10h of game ago to get the ending i wanted)
- Good fight system
- Good Assassination system ( Clean camps are as enjoyable as in Farcry)
- A lot of gear, perks, stats to get.
- Good characters (Kassandra >> Alexios ) (Socrates <3 )
- Really fun to hunt a full organisation 1 by 1
- Beautiful & big world !
- War Battle and ship battle are great

Cons : 
- Main story a little too short, you end it around level 40 
- There is no point in level up except getting spells (You deal same amount of damage during all the game, ALL ennemies scales with you)
- Fuck Boar hitbox, impossible to hit the head.
- Some choice have huge consequence and you have no idea until the end /spoil You have to do 8 actions or full dialogue right to save Deimos lul /spoil

The game doesn't feel like an Assassin's Creed game at all. If they named it something like ""A Greek Odyssey"", it'd totally make more sense.

The combat is nice and intuitive, and the skills are cool, albeit very anime and flashy, especially some level 3 skills.

In my opinion, the biggest downside to this game is actually the whole Mercenary/Bounty Hunter mechanic. By doing nefarious deeds you can rack up a decent bounty on yourself in which other mecenaries in the world can hunt you for it. The biggest problem is that they don't really 'hunt' you. It's totally unbalanced. They always just know where you are and come, literally, sprinting, not even on horseback. The mecenaries power themself is totally unbalanced. Mind you i'm playing on Normal, i have 44k Health and 7k Armour and the mercenaries will kill me in 3-5 hits. Not only that, but most have a trait that lets them have a canine or lynx or whatever companion, like who even are these people, champions of gods or something?

Alot of the basic grunts and stuff can be pretty tough to beat too. I've got a recurring glitch on my end where I sometimes lose all control of Kassandra/Alexios and the game merely repeats my last input, leading to me just walking right out of the cover of bushes into the face of enemies, blowing my entire stealth and having to deal with an entire fort just immediately knowing where I am. Hell, I was just playing and Died because of this. 

Some mercenaries can deal the fire element damage, and holy hell is it overpowered when they use it. So picture this; You're fighting the next mecenary to increase your own tier, he has a Lynx companion that's stuck so you go over and try to kill it, because to kill a boss you gotta kill the adds first right? well, he somehow hit me with ONE arrow and suddenly i'm ignited, like as if spontaneous combustion, (meanwhile it takes a barrage of your own attacks to ignite fire on enemies), and guess how much damage the Mercenaries fire does to you? It does whole Quarters of damage. Yep, a whole quarter of your health literally disappears every second. Then BOOM, this ridiculous input glitch occurs and I can't roll to extinguish the flames. Dead. Desynchronized.

Pretty Frustrating right?

Now anyway, Yeah, you can tell you aren't really playing as a trained assassin because of the clunky movement of your character, they're obviously very physically fit, but they aren't honed for parkour like Altair or Ezio was. This isn't so much a downside, but again, makes it feel like i'm not really playing an Assassin's Creed Game.

I'm only really giving this a thumbs up since the Naval Battles and the Storyline along with all these different plotlines are pretty cool, plus you get to meet Sokrates and Hippokrates, so that's cool. Good job to the teams that developed those mechanics and the Cult, as well as the story team. The rest all kind of makes me go 'eh'.",True,1539767850,1539767850,True,0,0,0,False
0,278,91,3135,548,76561198005867526,0,english,False,45306564,"Attention, this game is not really Assassin's Creed, it barely has 2 cutscenes about Assassin's Creed in it. And that is a good thing and let's hope it will stay this way. 

First of all. it is a true God of War adventure set in Greece. You start out as a simple merc who turns into a demi-god. The epicness is everywhere and it feels like a standalone title set on explaining this world of Greece, Mythos, people and setting. The gameplay is that of a good (1st time in the series) RPG. It combines elements of many modern games such as Dark Souls in form of combat style with lock on, very good accurate dodge system (unlike Origins), and Parry, you can also roll by holding dodge longer. Getting behind opponents back is rewarded. Shooting bow finally feels accurate and steady too. It now depends upon your skill and not bad game mechanics. Enemies have good accurate hitboxes and their moveset is where you expect it to be. If you want you can play stealthy. There are plenty of abilites (3 classes, ranged, warrior, rouge) that you get to choose upon leveling up with several layers of levels to them. You can only have a certain amount of said abilities equipped at once ala Witcher 3. Overall, combat feels very very good and accruate this time around. If you have skill you can be sure you will not fail in this game. It is also fairly cinematic and bloody (if you enable blood). 

The story is finally fun and has no kiddie hoodies (I am sorry I can no longer take Assassins in light of AC games seriously, they look like superheroes to me and I find them childish). The story is that of a fully fledged RPG that could be its own series, has little to do with AC games and it is good. The quests are Witcher 3 -esque. You can ask questions like in any other RPG and you get to make choices from time to time. Hell you can even romance. Quests are fun and this time around dialogue is cinematic which makes it fun to listen to (unlike Origins, in fact all the things Origins did even though it was a step in right direction are nothing compared to this game).

The exploration is fun and there is even a non-guided mod that allows you to play this game like an old school RPG where you are told to do something and there is no point to where to go, you gotta figure it out by listening to what people tell you. There are also investigation missions ala Batman Arkham series or Witcher 3. Loot is rewarding and it is fun to explore places looking for new cool boss fights and loot. Besides, the map itself is (oh again) Witcher-esque in a way that it has many locations marked with question marks that you can explore at will. 

Interface is nice and is fully customizable this time around. I turned off a coupla three things straight away. Bounty meter, hidden player lightup (whatever it is called in game) etc. 

Items have unique properties to them and various stats besides their good looks. You can really customize your character combining them with skills and adding engravings (like runes) with various stats to gear. 

Like all movement climbing has been improved, it now feels much more realistic, fluid and fun. Kinda feels like you are doing unspeakable feats of breavery when you climb mountains like you are a part of a myth yourself climbing Olimpus. Horse navigation has been improved.

Finally, main characters. Alexios and Kassandra are both very fun and very good. I am saying this because right now there is an on-going trend which essentially tells people that Alexios is boring, bad voice acting, bland, etc well it is simply not true. First of all the animations are on par, 2nd of all the player model is great and the voicing is superb. I played Mass Effect Andromeda as Female (I'm a dude) but this time I felt more like playing as a male demi-god hero and it took me great pains to decide after hearing all this rant on how he is bad. Well he is not. In fact I like him more than Kassandra. The difference is Kassandra is lovely, she can be sad, or funny. He is more ruthless, angry, but also roguish. Both are good, but if you want to play male, don't fret pick Alexios you won't regret.

The only thing you might not like is [u] level restriction [/u] which forces you to not engage something that is 5 lvls above you because you can do nothing to kill it. 4 levels is extremely slow and hard too, and so on. But this is not too much of an issue because game leads you from one area of level to the other so if you do not go exploring wildly you will be okay. Side quests are fun so it is not painful to level up. If you do wanna explore at will you can level up and abandon story for a bit and go explore regions that are suited to your level. Don't worry game will always be challenging in terms that enemies and quests will scale to your level if you out level them. So feel free to forget about main quest. However, if you do not want to level up you can (I strongly don't suggest) buy some boosters to level up but there are other ways to get your self level up on pc that do not require that. So if you so much desire you can get max level as the game starts and put it on hard and play it like a really really fun game that doesn't level lock you. But otherwise it is a standard RPG practice. 

Graphics are crisp, terrain and architecture is top notch. It is all just so beautiful to look upon. Very very good and is very nicely done, not really taxing my system on high I get 50-60 fps in 1080 on 980 GTX and i7 980 which is an 8 year old CPU 1st gen of i7s albeit 6 cores with base speed 3,3. Ubi added AVX update in 1.03 that enables older cpus. 12 Ram. 

Overall, this is the only game in Assassin's Creed Franchise that is really like while in the past I really liked AC 1, 2, Flag. Origins is not so bad but it was a 1st attempt and this is finally the mark. So please Ubisoft make quality games like this and do not do conveyor belt bad games anymore. Also, It feels good that people in your studios got tired of making the same game over and over and tried to experiment and it led you to such grand success. So use AC brand if you must but leave all the stuff that makes them Assassin's Creed and just keep making Odyssey styled RPGs.",True,1539765310,1539774448,True,0,6,0.603031396865844727,False

1. Controls using Steam-Controller (but xBox is likely to be similar)
The controls feel very indirect, everything is a bit like drenched in glue. Ship fights are extremely tedious. I failed a fight against three ships 7 times, switched to mouse/keyboard and even though i had to figure out the controls while fighting, it was a piece of cake. The worst thing about the controls in ship fights is however, that they are intentionally challenging your brain. throwing spears is RB, shooting arrows? LB+RB, LB alone does nothing and i find myself constantly aiming with LB, letting go of LB and nothing happens. No-one at Ubisoft actually play tested this. I am sure. 

2. Immersion breaking fortification mechanics
This is a big one. We have to tediously grind down leader fortification level of the leader of a region before we can attack and fight for control. However, if you at any point for whatever reason leave the area, the fight takes place without you - if it is lost the leader is back to maximum fortification level and you have to start all over. Doesn't sound too bad? The game designer hat the ****** idea to put locations exactly on the border so that you would very likely step outside. There is also no mark or line telling you that you are leaving. his mechanic is also not communicated to the player at any point. IT IS HARMFUL TO EXPLORE CLOSE TO BORDERS!

3. Immersion breaking Language(english version)
Okay, I play a Spartian character, grown up in sparta/greece, everyone is speaking greek around me my entire life, but I, the player, can not understand it. So the designer decided that dialogs are english with Greek accent and NPCs around you speak actual greek. WHAT THE?!? I feel like my character is a foreigner in its own country There should be no accent. I as a non-native english-speaker can _not_ hear the accent of someone from my own country speaking english. Moreover, I can perfectly understand what people around me say. The correct way to deal with it is to use some accent free english, either plain UK or AE. Everything else fucks with immersion. Really? who came up with that? I would like to understand what NPCs discuss while i am waiting for them to be alone to punch my spear right through their heart. Seriously, this is bad game design.

The map is huge, the story is interesting (to me).  People are saying that the game is great until the mid 20s.  This appears to be a complaint from people who don't want to do side quests and just want to do the main story line.  If you're just rushing through the game I think you will hit a level wall.  However, I can say I didn't do a large amount of side quests and didn't have any issues until around the early 30s.  I didn't mind it, but I noticed to get some exp I did need to do some side quests.  Here I was enjoying the game so much I didn't mind spending the 10 bucks or whatever for th lvl boost because it was a permanent boost and I had heard about the issue but didnt' know how bad it was....again...I'm in the early 30s and hadn't experienced it so far....so I guess it boils down to what content you're doing.  With this I've steadily progressed while doing minimal side quests.  However, I can say that without the exp boost I would have had to do more side quests.  The side quests themselves were entertaining.  A few of them made me chuckle (the minotaur specifically) and some othe quirky characters.  That being said, I think the side quests were done really well with fully voiced dialogue on side quests!  The bounty system is cool.  But I can say around lvl 10ish you'll start owning the bount hunters lol.  Just go predator shot, fire buff (poison at early lvl)..headshot...and they go down pretty quickly.  One thing i can say is that the hunter skill traits are too OP and leaves no need to be stealthy at all.  There is less of an assassin feel in this game, but I think it boils down to your playstyle.  You're just not forced to go 100% stealth, and you're not really punished if you get caught.  Just run out the area then try again after a minute after the AI resets (it sounds horrible-but yea).....or just predator shot...move around...or fight.  Battle AI could be better.  One on One battles are  a joke (but in what game except dark souls is it not?).  Fighting a group of enemies, ESPECIALLY bounty hunters, can be dangerous when they start lobbing bombs with AOE effects at you.  They can burn you pretty quickly if you're not careful.  I've recalled a few instances where a higher lvl bounty hunter joined the gang I was fighting and din't realize he was higher lvl then destroyed me in 2 hits lol.  But when fighting the bounty hunters grouped up (they literally moved as a group too - I was at bounty lvl 5) I got a real sense of fight or flee.  I often chose fight haha cause it was a challenge and was fun.

In short....Fun experience equals keeping your bounty at minimum 3 helmets....if you hate side quests then this game is not for you......and max predator shot as early as possible.",True,1539741214,1539741622,True,0,0,0,False

Pros
- Graphics have been further improved as well as options. The game gives you more choices for tweaking to help improve your FPS (Frames Per Second).
- Main Story: The main story will keep you interested and wanting to know what happens next.
- Different Abilities: you have new abilities to choose from and your choices do matter.

Cons ( Brace yourself)
- Side Missions: 
They are boring and tedious. While the main story quests give you important options to choose from, side mission's choices do not. The NPC/people in the game view you as a god, yet send you to find X object, kill X person, or even find their damn husband. 

Travel Time:

Some missions require extensive amounts of travel time. One such shinying example is a side quest where you must take an athlete to where he will compete. Sounds simple enough. You have to travel by boat, over waves, 2,000-3,000 meters to get to him. Then to take him to the area where he will compete is another 7,000 meters. I found myself watching either youtube or messing around on Facebook more than actually playing the game. 


- Combat
Combat feels like it was made more simplistic. In origins you had to time your parry well to be able to get a good counter attack in. However in Odyssey when parrying, you get a 3 second window in which if you are attacked, even by multiple enimies, you will parry. You don't even need to be facing the enemy either to parry. 

- Less Abilities
While the abilities given do bring new play styles to combat, origins had extensivly more options. The menu and options feel once again dumbed down like the combat. To make matters worse unlike in origins, after reaching max level (50), you can no longer earn ability points. The amount of ability points you get is all you will have and you CANNOT unlock all of the abilities. Hence why your choices matter.

- Damage
Damage is split amoung different types now. You do not have a hidden blade to level up like in origins, rather a single value. The armor pieces you wear can increase the value as well as some abilities. But you will notice that the damage values are all on steriods. Enimies have over 100K health, Enemey Ships have over 500K health. Your damage for you ship is about 50K to start off with, and gets exceptionaly higher. However if you look at the health bar of your enemy, you notice you are doing the same amount as if you where in origins. So why are the damage values on steriods? To make us feel powerful when really nothing has changed?


- Bounty Hunters/Mercenarys
These enemies will be the single most annoying part of this game. If your bounty is high enough, a Merc (Mercenary) will be sent after you. Except the system is horribly broken. They will spawn 50-60 Meters away from you and auto route themselves to your position where they will attack you on site. Bounties will increase if you kill, or steal. Even when a quest has you defend yourself from enemies who start a fight, if you kill them, you get the bounty. If you decide to defend yourself from a merc, if you take to long, another will come along to join in on the fun. Soon you will find yourself facing 4+ mercs/hunters when it all started with one. You can pay off bounties from the Map screen but as you level up, the cost goes up. 

- Quest within a Quest within a Quest
While the main story line does keep you interested, that is only happening if you are actually doing a main quest. More times than I can count the main story would have me do a side quest. Problem is that side quest has 3 quests of its own, and to top it all off, even some of those quests have their own to do. These sides quests follow the same pattern as any other side quest. Kill, Find, free X person/object. It feels like useless padding of the game when you are having to travel all over just to complete what started out as one quest and has turned into 10 of them.

- Enemy Damage VS Yours
Some targets and grunts can use Posion, and Fire. IF you are hit by their weapon you have the status effect immeditly applied. However when you attempt to posion or set an enemy on fire, you have to build up a meter above their head before it is applied. To make matters worse, if you have an effect applied by an enemies weapon, you take large amounts of damage to your health while if you manage to apply one to an enemy, he/she only takes upwards of 500 damage. Totally makes sense to have an enemy take 500 posion or fire damage every 2 seconds when he/she has 100K health.

However, I do love the combat in Odyssey, and the quests and world is still nothing to scoff at. Naval combat feels a little weird, but I've always felt it was weird in the AC games, and the process of upgrading your ship feels a bit awkward, but that's not a huge complaint. Some people said it was grindy, and I personally only felt that after I beat the story. I played this game for like a week straight and beat the game, and I loved it. It's actually really, really fun. Some people complained about the microtransactions, and while they are scummy, they're never actually brought up in the game, and are always just a little prompt in the menu. They're in no way forced on you, and frankly there's very little motivation to buy things. The economy in the game gets a bit crazy because you feel like you don't really have to buy many things, and the vendors are mostly useless. The game is fun though, and I'd recommend it to anyone. The quests are fun, and the sidequests are fun too (even though thats sometimes a complaint). The other issue is that the game runs a little weird.

Combat: Combat can be difficult at times, making you come up with new strategies to get through zones, or areas. The variation also adds to the combat to create less monotony inside fighting, gives it a little spice and pazazz; even with there being a little variation in the combat it can be monotonous, which can be a turn off at times due to that being a very large part of the game.

The world: This open world can blow you away and be very overwhelming at times, its massive, and beautiful, but they do a verygood job of keeping you to one small area in the beginning of the game till you get the hang of how exploration in the game,

Quest: Some quest are good, some are bad, as it is in most games, the biggest downfall so far of the questing system is, that they use it to extend play time, you have to reach a certain level to progress in the storyline, which forces you to do the side quest, which are sometimes alot of fun. I'm not a fan of the having to level up to progress in the story, but it does some how add a rewarding feeling when you are able to complete the mission you've been working to get to.

Bugs: The bugs are very funny, and sometimes add a well needed comedic break. If you're one of the people who does not enjoy bugs one bit, or wants to be fully immersed, just think of it as a glitch in the animus :)

While the game aims to be historical, certain elements from Greek mythology are present in the game too. I gotta say this is a better game than Origins. The world is more varied and has more stuff to do. Thanks to the new dialogue choice system, you can now decide how the story progresses. It's like a ""choose your own adventure"" book but in video game format. The game takes place hundreds of years before the assassins where officially formed by Bayek. The player character is not an assassin but the story will definitely fit in to the lore of Assassin's Creed. So this game could be considered to be a sort of prequel to the entire series.

I have some minor technical issues (micro freezing after playing a few hours when traveling to different areas)  because I have a 6 year old pc with a low end gpu (750 ti) and only 8gb ram.

Skyrim with wallclimbing and a bit of sailing.

Genral Points:
- The combination of open world and climbing from assassins creed fixes the annoyment that other opon world rpgs have.
- I was stupid to buy the xp boost, you get flooded with so much exp that without doing any side missions, just exploring a bit the world I was already max level before half of the game. Also you need to upgrade your gear at each level up so it actually made it grindier because it was impossible to get all the materials for the fast level up.
- a few parts seem to make more sense if you play as Kassandra, intead of Alexious

Pros:
- Really nice world and you dont feel hampered in the movement at all.
- for those who like history its quite nice to just wander around(of course its not really accurate since then it would be bad gamedesing)

Cons:
- legendary items are too easy to get and have no real questline related to their backstory. so much wasted potential
- game balance between the classes is bad, warrior is just exceedingly strong. especially against all the bosses you cant assassinate because of cutscenes.
- Quests: to many, to short, to little npc development. They lack depth and interaction. Depending on your use of fast travel you might end up skipping parts. Also often faaaar to easy to complete. 
- Locations: to many, to short, to little npc development. They lack depth and interaction.
- boss fights are booring and too few, need more stages and thought. Also they forgot to put in scaling health with level. I killed one in below 10 seconds. Also assassin and hunter skills are mostly useless in those fights.",True,1539720924,1539720924,True,0,0,0,False

Great, despite the horrible optimization I was able to lower some setting to a mix of high - mid and achieve betweeen 55-70 FPS scene depending. Now suddenly the game has started to lock up and freeze causing me to have to hard reset my PC.  I've been reading up on this issue as it appears others are having the same problem, and it appears to be an issue with Uplay itself. I paid $140 Canadian for the best edition possible and I feel rather cheated not being able to play more of the game without damaging my PC, thus for that reason alone I'm giving this game a negative review. It is LITERALLY unplayable.

Now lets talk about the actual game.

What does the best edition get you. Well it gets you the season pass for DLC not yet disclosed, some armor that will become unneeded by within the first 3 hours, a horse skin, and not much else. The game is huge, it is grindy, but it is fun. You level up your boat through naval combat and collecting plunda baby ( Dusty Rhodes reference). You level up your character by taking over islands by way of assassinating lead political figures within the island which can eventually lead to a large scale war fighting on the Spartan side. You also upgrade a spear which has the power to change the world itself. To do this you kill cultist and take their part of an artifact. Thus while this game is grindy, I found that there was enough mix and match when it came to the grind that I never got bored.

The story itself is also intreguing. Not going to spoil any of it, but something eventful happens and then your character slowly uncovers the reasons of why things happened the way they happened.

This game is AMAZING. Beautifully crafted, immersive characters, I haven't really touched on much of the story other than the fact that I seem to be an orphan from Sparta living on a neighboring island. I have to kill this Cyclops dude and I'm really hoping its an actual Cyclops. Idk if they included fantasy elements other than the usual but I'm kinda hoping they did, because I was a huge fan of Greek Mythology when I was a kid. I feel it's definitely worth the buy as of right now, that's with my play time under advisement.

My only complaints is that the game seems to get hung up at times, I'm assuming this is an object loading issue, however, it could be my system setup. There's screen tearing too, even with V Sync on. However, I'm not holding this against the game cuz I probably am nearing upgrade time on my PC, so do what you will given that info. I'm running an i5 6600K. One major thing that I noticed was calling my horse. The horse will appear but it will just be a texture and it kinda just stands there. I can walk through it, it just takes a little bit sometimes to fully render. If I upgraded my PC I'm sure that problem would disappear, but parts are expensive, we all know this getting into PC gaming.

But yesterday i watched skillups review of oddysey and although lenghty it really summarises it perfectly for me. 

The TLDR; version is that the start and the end of the game is really good , but it's tainted by the middle.
The game forces you to do meaningless sidequests to bloat the game with ""content"" so you can grind past the level gates in the game. 

The world is too big . Assests are reused to fill up square miles and its hurts the experience. A more focused half sized map would feel more meaningful. like the moment you ride into sparta! That is one of the only places in the game that feels different from the rest of the game. 

Combat is waaaay more enjoyable than origins but still shows cracks. Killmoves are again only on the last enemy which annoyed me alot in orgins aswel. You can become very OP with skills and the game counters that by giving enemies stupid strong skills. And last but not least enemies have way to much health.

Costumisation is amazing and the rpg element of the weapons and yourself as a character work really well.

Alexios at times feels like a dumb strong doofus. Kassandra her voice actor is better imo but is written like a male character. This really doesn't work well. (There's a technical reason behind it i think but it's no excuse).

The world itself is really pretty and the assassin mechanic without spoiling anything is done really well and i hope to see it in future games .

This is not the game if you want that asasssin feel and story. There are no assassins or templars in this game ! Some ISU elemets are done well and others well... are pretty shit. 

If the forced sidequests weren't well.. forced i would recommend this game to everyone. Now i'm not to keen on doing so. because the middle of the game I know is going to push away alot of people.

I've had countless UI bugs (e.g. breath meter not showing up when you're underwater, or health bar dissappearing), various NPC bugs (T-posing guards, NPCs floating around or getting stuck on nothing and running on the spot), the enemies will sometimes 'see' you though walls and buildings one minute but dont notice you stabbing a dude stood adjacent to them the next, they will 'lose' you as soon as you're somewhere they cant climb to so in order to avoid enemies you can let them watch you climb 10 feet in the air onto a balcony and boom, they've lost you and walk away, which just ruins the fun. There's no point actually trying to be stealthy when the enemies are incredibly inconsistent with how they behave.

The skills/perks are really lackluster compared to Origins and in some cases are also buggy (There's a perk for summoning a leutenant to fight with you for 40 seconds, sometimes he spawns but just stands still and does nothing). The 'assassinate' button doesn't work sometimes when enemies move (the prompt to stealth attack dissappears even if they are still in range) and to do a 'power assassination' you have to hold the button instead of pressing it, which you don't have time to do if enemies are walking. Sometimes you will hold the button, the meter will be half way towards filling, then the enemy you're trying to assassinate will turn round and boom, you're spotted so no assassination. It's incredibly frustrating. 

They've done a lot of things well with this game (Tons of interesting side quests that aren't just fetch quests) and they've made a very beautiful game but it feels rushed.

I still have not been to every island in this game (135hrs). 

People who say this game is a Grind haven't played ARK, This game is a Grind but it is an enjoyable one. 

I am not even bored of this yet thanks to the Explore option which makes u uncover all the areas rather than u finding a high point and showing everything in the area u are in. Brilliant idea.

I love the selection of weapons in this game but for me the one they forgot that i love to use is the sword and Shield. Now i know that your Spear is a big part in the game but it would have been a nice weapon set, running around with a Spartan Shield and your Spear.


Pros: 

Beautiful Graphics.
BIG Map to move around. 
The Armour upgrading is great if u find a piece u want to keep.
The Merceneries really add a nice challenge to the game. 

Cons: 

When fighting sometimes a guy goes Red (which is a hint to Dodge or Parry) when u dodge and as the enemy spin kicks he spins round with u and still hits u, which can't really be done when in the air. u need to dodge away from them because if u dodge behind them they follow u even half way thru a move

You need to grind a hell of a lot if u want to upgrade ur armour when higher lvls. 
Every time i go into the Options it keeps Resetting my Settings before i even select anything.


Tip to boost your perfomance:
If you switch the volumetric clouds from max to high it boosts your fps a lot by no visual difference. I'm getting about 7-10 fps more.
Tip to level up ""fast"":
Just accept every quest which you can get at the board if you discover a new city. A lot of side quests are similar so you can mostly do 2 or even more quests at the same time.

The open world mixed with RPG elements mimic the feel of Witcher 3 more then classic Assassin's Creed releases, and that's what made it so appealing for an outsider to the series. The game feels, looks and sounds great, all the aspects of the presentation made it truely a breath-taking experience. 

I'm also glad the action and plot is far more focused on the historical setting then the immersion breaking animus plot of the previous games. Truth be told, if the animus and modern day element was completely taken out of this game, it wouldn't make much of a difference. Even those few little bits where we step out of our mind-machine are not really obtrusive and can be entirely skipped - huge plus!

The gameplay takes best part of the witcher, and mixes it with more soft-stealth mechanics, parkour and elements of naval combat which feels meaty and satisfying! You get to swing various weapons, combine those into sequences and play around with ranged weapons and special abilities. Some of them are overt the top, but okay, given the fact it's an action game with lighthearted power fantasy fun in mind... but some are just weird, allowing you to teleport over insane distances and shoot through walls.
That is all fine, but that's where my first gripes come out. As much as I like the combat, since it looks meaty and satisfying, the amount of damage we do to our foes is... anything but. A whole flurry of blows dished out left and right feels like we're barely tickling them to death with feathers, and that, my friends, is the issue of level scaling. The whole game is divided into leveled zones - you go into that level, and a random wolf might be 2 or 3 levels higher then you? It'll tear you to bloody shreds in 2 attacks! While you can smash it with spears, swords and what not, scraping pathetic one percent of their HP! Despite the fact you killed hundreds of soldiers already, monsters even... you can't kill a friggin pig, cause it has the BS MMO philosophy behind it's stats! One thing I hated about the Witcher, and I despise about this game as well, is this ridiculous progression. Minimum levels always scales up to your current one, meaning if you go to a zone that you visited on level 10, and take a quest now that you are lvl 30, every npc will be scaled to your current level! It kills the sense of progression! There are constantly things that are tougher than you, and you are never 'stronger' then things that you used to fight some time ago. The progression is a facade really, since you are in constant need for more equipment of roughly same level. Upgrading your existing one becomes soon SO expensive that it's pointless after a while.

And here we come to elephant in the room, the microtransactions, which are a scummy thing forced by Ubisoft. Not only because they are almost necessary to skip the tedious grind! (playing this game without 25% permanent boost is a grindfest) but! You have to buy the drachmi boost as well! Cause if you lag behind with cash and resources, catching up with the equipment to fit your level is an actual trap! If you buy yourself an XP boost, you will level faster, but your equipment will remain few levels behind, cause you won't be able to afford to upgrade it! With XP boost you are literarly level-capping your own gear progression! Insane.

Thankfully the game is fun enough on it's own to continue and grind a bit for resources and gear, every now and then. Every day, as you log in, there is enough diverse content to do and experiment with. I can't say the repetition of certain quest bother me, since there is so much to do anyway. Plunder a fort, naval battle, hunt, assassination, duel with other mercs, or battlefield quest, if you dose your experience correctly, you'll have enough variety to keep yourself entertained.

Now for the performances. I played and tested both characters... and I cannot agree with the kneejerk praise for Kassandra. I tell you, Alexios is FAR better character. Of the two syblings, (who are exactly the same in plot and dialogues), Alexios is big choppy spartan warrior with a heavy voice and accent. He is an athletic giant and whenever shows a softer side, like taking care of little Kefalonian girl, or reuniting with his family, the contrast is only more impactful. He is easy to distinguish, you can shut your eyes, listen to some in game dialogue and instantly know that's him. You can't say the same about Kassandra, which sounds more like every other generic character at best. Worse yet, she gives the impression of your typical quiping semi-self aware Mass Effect Andromeda female sidekick which now seems to be the obligatory element on the list of cookie-cutter characters to include in an AAA video game.
Alexios all the way.

In short: This is one of the best AC games I played, it's not really challenging, more straightforward power-fantasy sandbox fun, and it's great. (Also, I have not experienced any glitches or bugs so far, beside few frame drops due to volumetric clouds, but it's something easy to fix with some meddling in the settings. Meaning, the moment I entered the fun, most of the bugs must have been ironed out already.)",True,1539681649,1539681649,True,0,0,0,False

They've redeemed the series hands down by making a fresh, beautiful, interactive, and interesting world. Ancient Greece is wonderful and playing this game will only make you want to visit this part of the world in person.

The combat is refreshing, high paced, skill based, and a lot of fun. The dialogues are well made, there's an interesting storyline to go with it and my god. SO. MUCH. CONTENT. This is the first triple A title I buy within a month of release in YEARS and I am not dissapointed with Odyssey.

Very satisfied with this game. Thank you Ubisoft for redeeming the Assassin's Creed series like this. If your future titles are on the same level of polish as this one then you've brought me back from those who didn't want to deal with Assassin's Creed ever again.

I think my biggest critique honestly is the fact that the Animus concept is still a thing. I don't care about the Assassin's in modern times anymore. I want to explore Ancient Greece, I want to develop Kassandra or Alexios the way I want, I want this to be my story and the return to the present (I mean it's only happened once in 23 hours of gameplay so they're very uncommon) ruin the immersion for me. Assassin's Creed should focus on what it does best in future titles and that is to recreate ancient times and ancient environments without bothering with adding a parallel modern days storyline.

Boy, were they wrong. Really, Ubisoft wouldn't sell XP and gold boosters if there wasn't a grind. I often found I didn't have enough gold or materials to keep my favorite gear leveled. All of the enemies are leveled, so if you have, say, a bow that is a few levels under the enemies', you'll have to shoot them fifty times in the head if they are an elite enemy or something.

Everytime I leveled up, I though ""Oh, crap, I hope i have enough resources to upgrade or buy gear"" that compliments my playstyle.""I play on hard, but it's just artificially hard. Enemies get obscene amounts of health and damage. I can't imagine playing on nightmare. Ubisofts actual answer to this is to play on easy, but that does not help me.

I don't want to steamroll though easy. I just want solid gameplay that doesn't feel hindered by RPG mechanics.  There is no middle ground like that to Ubisoft, they just want you to buy boosters.

Some of the quests are decent enough, but others are lamesauce. It's pretty disappointing to start off the game fighting the Persians with the 300 and then go on to... deliver letters. Some quests are even lamer. The NPC justs ask you for some money, which you  can decide to give or not. That's the quest. Why Ubisoft? 

I also gotta mention just how large and detailed the world is in the game. It's kind of amazing. Unfortunately,  I felt like the RPG mechanics constantly conspired to take me away from it. Ugh, I got to go back to the blacksmith, or go to my inventory and dismantle a bunch of crap weapons I will never use.  The different areas in the game are also restricted by level, because some guys' eyeballs are much tougher to stab I guess.

I think it's super easy of a game even on the higher level settings. Seems like the most important gear is lumber. Which you need crazy ammounts for upgrades which is fine, but you get so much loot and gear as you move along that it seems like if you upgrade your stuff, then 10 minutes later you find something better than your upgraded gear that you spent a ton on. I don't understand the whole ISU ancient alien stuff, but I wasn't impressed with it. The story is kind of lame as there is know connection or explaination as to how the main characters survive. The paths that you choose have no real affect on the game. For example if you choose not to kill your dad, the story still makes you say and act like you did.  After getting my boat I think I found like 8 LT.s for it within 30 minutes and only got it up to be able to hold 3 slots. The combat is fun but very limited. You get all of these skills but can only use 4 at a time unless you pause and reassign but that grows old fast.  It felt very confusing about what alignment you were with. You couldn't choose a side which is fine but with all of the quests going on, I never knew who to fight or not to fight. Oh I need to kill spartans now...oh I need to kill athenians now. Oh 100 meters to the west it's a town of people I need to go see, but do I need to fight them or not?  I like how big the world is and it's gorgeous but after jumping into water and diving for loot for the 100th time, I got pretty bored with it. The bird almost feels like a cheat as you can fly it find everyting you need to loot or kill with it. THe whole VR experience was confusing and seemed out of place. For example a bit of a ways in you step out of the VR and say you need to take care of stuff. Well you then are be able to interact with old emails and videos and notes  from what I researched off line to be from other games? Why did they not offer that at the begining of the game as a means of introducing the background to the player. Seemed really out of place and poorly planned. The cult of kosmos thing was kind of neat, but again too easy.  Also I learn about my homeland where I start being in trouble but when I Hear of thise and return, except for the visual change, I have no interaction to find out what happened and how I could help. Why bring this up during the game if you can't do anything about it? The purple things to buy gear seems cool to do, but was afraid to spend any of it because of what I said before is that every time I got new gear or upgraded, then I would immediatly find something better within 30 minutes. Kassandra as a character is pretty bad ass but the way the game was directed makes her out to be the biggest hypocryt in the world.  I enjoyed my time but outgrew it in a hurry.

Game play 7/10: it could use a little more variety, I personally don't like games that limit your skills, but it is still good

Ship combat/sailing 9/10: REALLY fun, gets a little repetitive but still fun to do most of the time 

Art/Music 10/10: Everything just looks great, I personally have no preformance issues. Using 980 ti and a i7 3770

Story 3/10: While at most maybe half way though, certain aspects of it just killed it for me, it is layed out in my spoiler tag

Gameplay is excellent, the art team blew it away it looks amazing, the music is great love sailing and my sailors start singing it is incredible, ship combat is awesome. I got sucked into the world very fast and it was for 20 hours money well spent. I completly forgot I was playing an Assassin's Creed game and it was all a simulation and I thought I was playing a game by Bethseda. Then the story progressed and I remembered something a buddy who had already had the game had mentioned.

Spoiler ahead:

[spoiler]God damn aliens, like really? I got up to the part in the main story quest very late I think as I was  doing a ton of side quests and ship combat cause it was just amazing but once the guy said  something about people who came before I instantly remembered about the aliens. Here I was enjoying everything about this game, but once I remembered that they were in it I just closed it and really don't have any interest in it at all. 

I will most likely go back and finish it because everything else is just amazing, but that whole fact is just terrible and really killed the mood for me.[/spoiler]

Another thing that bugs me is the cash shop. I don't mind the cosmetics, whenever something comes out I actually like I will buy it, my issue is with stuff like resources. The game gets pretty grindy later on and you start to run out of resources upgrading your ship and equipment. But for only 20 bucks you can buy enough resources to upgrade some of your equipment or a couple high end ship upgrades!

I have to go with a no on this sadley. It is just because of the story mainly. If that is something that you don't think you wont care about AT ALL I would say get it. Otherwise wait till it goes on sale.

- You run from place to place like a berserker on your way to the next main quest and butcher everything on the way. There is no need to play stealthy anymore in all small camps, because soldiers are just stacked together and it is faster to just go in and kill everything
- Everywhere you go, there are collectible ores and plants laying around for some reason. In caves they even hide ores on the ceiling so you have to spam the scan ability to find everything and then climb on every third wall (time consuming and not fun at all...)
- In the level-up menu, everything is just called a ""skill"". You dont know if its a skill you have to equip to 4 melee or 4 ranged slots, if its a passive or an active ability that is replaced by another button, so you never know how the skill will work
- After every activity you run at least 1000 foot to the next location (game is way too huge with not enough interesting locations you come back to and start to enjoy)
- The game is filled with low quality sidequests (sand watch icon missions), which are way worse than the quests from origins
- Every ""boss"" human or animal is just an hp sponge which also does more damage to you
- You can unlock the ""this is sparta"" kick very early in the game, which lets you cheese all kind of enemies, by going on a high place and kicking them down, inflicting tons of damage (ability is also on a very low cooldown)
- Performance is way worse than in Origins
- The combat is slightly more fun, but does not feel really balanced anymore
- Exp boosters and material packs

Pros:
[1] Visuals are absolutely stunning. Gorgeous open world with lots of interesting areas to explore.
[2] The main story was interesting with some nice plot twists.
[3] Lots of variety in combat depending on your skill builds.
[4] Cultist system is one of the best implementations of assassination targets and it feels like you are hunting them down by finding clues and moving up the chain.
[5] Crafting system is fun and give you the option of upgrading what you like, albeit at a cost.
[6] The characters are interesting enough to keep me invested. Too bad it's mixed with grindy side quests that do nothing to progress character building.

Neutral:
[1] Naval combat was pretty meh. Nothing special but not bad either.
[2] Mercenary system was fine, it did its job for the most part.
[3] Dialogue options are a good addition to the system but really underused. The main quests has some key choices that do affect the ending, but the rest of the time its inconsequential so you do whatever you like. No paragon/renegade style effects.
[4] The romance options are so bad that they're almost good. Take it as a comedic relief and its fine.

Cons:
[1] The world is just too big with little to ""fill"" that space with. Cities have copy-pasted buildings and temples and they start to feel like more of the same. Many locations are just barren expanse of nothingness that you have to travel across because there's no fast travel point anywhere nearer.
[2] Level gating. Seriously, I don't want to play the boring and repetitive fetch quests to earn xp just to progress further. Conquest battles are fun the first couple of times, then it just gets boring with underwhelming rewards. XP requirements definitely need a lot of tweaking for the main quest because the side quests are dull af. The grind is too monotonous to be worth the time.
[3] The auto save system is just garbage. It puts you far back from your objective if you die, and there's no other option but to walk/ride there again. Put some more fast travel points for gods sake.
[4] This game is trying really hard to imitate The Witcher 3 but failing to deliver anything close to the story that it provides. In my opinion, the story makes an rpg a good game, not the game mechanics and latest gen graphics. There's definitely potential here but not everything has to be like the witcher.

Conclusion:
Its not a game for everyone. I personally enjoyed it and would like to see it improved with some tweaks. Most people would likely put it down when they hit the mid game grind. Its a shame because the main story is quite interesting if it hadn't been forcefully expanded into this vast open world with copy-paste fetch quests. Cultist and Atlantis storylines are definitely worth completing if you can slog through the level grind. If you like that kind of game then its definitely for you.

The new Assassins Creed as a promised fullblown RPG game.
Which is set in the peloponnes war in greece (404 to 431 b.c.).
I´ve played almost every AC game, expect Syndicate. Because AC felt boring and out of ideas, gameplay wise.
But behold, Origins was a very good game, which I enjoyed to the end.

Now Odyssey picks the formular which made Origins a good game and mixes it with some new gameplay elements.
Decisions that really have a impact, for example.
I had to make a decision if I would kill or save a family that seem to have somekind of virus.
Of course I spared their lifes, just to see the whole land get plagued with their sickness, later in the game. I was shocked and amazed at the same time. I thought that my decision wouldnt make a difference in the Game.
 

World:
The Gameworld is larger and even more beautiful than the World in Origins.
It is packed with locations to discover, boss animals to defeat or beautiful cities to explore.
And dont even get me started with the sea which can be sailed with your own ship.


Combat / Gameplay:
The Combat is the same as you are used to AC games, expect the adition of “abilities” that can be leveld up and be used while in combat.
Its too bad that you cant use a shield like your enemies do.
Depending on the location where you are, enemies are on a higher or lower level than you are.
Which makes some fights really hard and challenging. Some enemies can only be slayed, if you have got a almost equal level as them. Just like in Origins.
The “God Challenges” and “Papyrus Riddles” from Origins make a return in Odyssey.
The Challenges are mighty and majestic animals that you need to track down.
But the “Papyrus Riddles” are only extra perks for your weapons instead of legendary equipment and weapons.
Which is kind of a let down.


Story:
The Story is interesting and versatile. I have played around 36 hours to this date of this review and it feels like that the story is almost as good as the story in AC 2.
Alexios (The protagonist) has character depth to him and even some humor, based on your answers to the NPC´s.
I am curious how long the Main story will take me to finish and how it will end.


Graphics:
The Graphics are just as good or even a bit better than in Origins.
The Lighting is vivid, textures are highly detailed and the performance seems good.
I get around 40-60 fps on a 1920×1080 resolution, with a GTX 1060 (6 Gb), at High to Ultra Settings.
But there is a problem with the texture streaming sometimes.
Some textures seem to take a longer time to load and appear blurry and messed up for a short period.

Conclusion:
A first review of this game, even if I am kind of early in the game.
The Story and gameplay is very good and just got some minor flaws until now.
Alexios is a charismatic and likeable guy, who acts based on your decisions.
The gameworld is vivid and one of the most beautiful I have ever seen.
Even if the Game has some Ghost Recon: Wildlands vibe to it,

I would recommend this game to every Assassins Creed fan or newbies to the franchise.

Some of the mercs look like male bodybuilders with womens voices- really, they should have just made them all men instead of trying to meet a gender quota.  There is a black female pirate leader that looks like a WWE wresler, but that's only 1 bad character out of hundreds so not a major issue.  Almost all of the NPC characters are really good.  The modern day character and her 'girl power' team are just annoying, but you only play her for a few minutes so its not a big deal.

Grinding: 
If all you ever want do to in this game is the main storyline, then yes, there might be some grinding in between. Otherwise this criticism is laughable. I've overleveled the main story line by some levels just by exploring the sorroundings, killing some enemies and checking out some locations. And still there is so much unexplored non-main-story stuff in my level range left. People who call this game grindy are probably better off playing WoW with an instaboost to level 120 or whatever it is nowadays.

Microtransactions: 
Sure, there are microtransactions available and if the only reason you bought the game for is to whine about something that doesn't affect gameplay at all, then this is indeed a big issue. Otherwise, you could just play the game without ever visiting the store page and not missing out on anything other than some useless crew skins or weapons that you could also come by via the Oikos without spending any real money. 

Performance issues:
The main reason for most of the negative comments here and there are undoubtedly issues with some pc configs. For me this game runs absolutely fine, a lot better than origins. Still, I can understand players frustrated with performance issues and hopefully this will be addressed soon.

In my opinion this is a very solid, pretty addictive game and easily the best entry in the series (unless you care about being a real assassin). Of course your impression may vary as tastes are different. I just wanted to point out that two of the major criticisms found in the reviews are objectively ridiculous unless you're 
a) lazy or spoilt by the modern 'instaboost me to max level and give me legendary loot to start with' rpg-culture

On another note I'm also a big fan of RPGs so when I heard that this game was leaning towards the more RPG side of things I was quite excited and honestly I'm impressed. The game is optimized well I rarely have any framerate drops and have never crashed and the story is quite good.

I have heard some complaints about the grinding for levels later in the story (about level 25 I think), but in my opinion the side quest I find are entertaining enough that I didn't much mind it the grind; even then when I had to grind I only had to gain a level or two to continue the story. Are the side quest as engaging as Witcher 3? I would say not quite, but not far off.  

I would say that if you are a fan of RPGs and have liked the Assassins Creed series since it's debut game, you will most likely enjoy this game as well. The dialogue system which I was honestly concerned with is actually quite decent and the consequences to your selections are not as apparant until later which adds replayability. I would recommend this game at full price as even at this time I'm at about 30+ hours and I don't think I'm close to finishing the game. The Voice acting can be spotty. The male character is quite iffy at times, but I found the female protagonist is more consistent in quality. It's really up for debate.

I tested what mechanics I could. Literally the only thing i enjoyed about this... was the ability to Spartan kick your enemies off ledges.  

First off the mechanics work more like Shadow of War than they do AC. There's no Eagle Vision (which is crucial part of AC), it's entirely free roam on a large open map (not a bad concept) but the movement of the character felt more like Witcher 3 than it did AC. They implemented this lock-on system which only works on enemies (again not bad) but it felt chunky.

No animation for skinning animals or even looting large boxes. It just happens. My character caught fire by running past a Brazier (not through it... past it)  The gear system is wierd... nothing inherently wrong with it i dont guess. just not the same.  

The whole point of Assassin's Creed is that you are a modern day person who has ancestry blood linking you to an important assassin... they only touch on the Animus concept once for like 30 seconds, and it's barely enough to call itself AC.

I DID LIKE: the dialogue options and the choice consequences. As well as the fact that you dont just fail for being seeen on a stealth mission. It actually had in game consequences... however though i enjoyed that... it's not how AC works... your character is supposed to be reliving memories.... so if you stray too far from said memory you desynchronize.... thats how the animus works..

I lived over 350h in Witcher Wild Hunt. After that I couldn't find satisfaction in games anymore and moved on with my life - got married, pushed my music carreer a bit, watched all star trek shows again, and GoT, and some others, finished some books that got dusty, listened to music that was waiting for me, and done a lot of IRL stuff that I almost forgot existed. I really tried and just started to think there probably will never be another game like W3.

Now there is this game, and:

1) You don't die after jumping/falling from 2 meters high;
2) Your side quests do not fail automaticly after completing an act of the game;
3) Your horse performs in 90% less buggy way;
4) You can play the whole game as a girl;
5) She actually looks like a strong fighter not an anorectic ""model"" so you can buy it when she beats up a pack of soldiers;
6) And fighting is a bit more interesting (if anyone cares);
7) You can climb, and jump on roofs, trees, and all sorts of stuff and the explorable enviroment is much more 3D;
8) You can act like whatever sexual orientation you wish and choose ""romance"" regardless of your gender or choose nobody;
9) But the act itself is not viewed, so you don't have to cover your screen from bystanders;
10) You can have a pet;
11) You can have naval battles;
12) You can kick those pesky opponents from the cliff to help them meet hades or whatever;
13) You don't have to deal with that f***ing magic and magicians, while the world still feels somehow ""magical"";
14) When you try to collect some loot quickly, you do not light and extinguish those darn candles over and over again.

[EDIT]

15) Additionally to your ship, you can use few types of small boats, and none of them turns to splinters after touching something few times.

[/EDIT]

And beside it is a little less ambiguous in moral choices, while those have a tiny bit lesser impact on the story, or you cannot play almost-pacifistic (game kinda endorses being a drahma greedy murderer), this is a pretty much the same game, with lots of interesting stories, characters, quests, exploration and artifacts, that takes place in a beautiful and enormous world of historical/fantastical Greece instead of historical/fantastical Poland.

I don't know about people who liked AC games, but if you liked Witcher games, this one you will not regret.



PS: Troll bla bla, not again this stupid Witcher comparsion, bla bla hate, maybe you're going to say fights are like Dark So...

ABOUT GRINDING

I feel I have to comment on the grinding issue. This is a really decent RPG so I can compare it to one of the greatest - TES Morrowind, where few questline steps after the beginning we meet Caius Cosades who says: 

""[...] Here's 200 drakes. Go get yourself a decent weapon. Or armor. Or a spell. And second thing... you need a cover identity. Around here, 'freelance adventurer' is a common profession. Sign on with the Fighters Guild, or Mages Guild, or Imperial cult, or Imperial legion, advance in the ranks, gain skill and experience. Or go out on your own, look for freelance work, or trouble [...]"".

AC Odyssey wants to achieve something similar. Encourage you to take a break from rushing through main quests, to go expolre, raid a tomb or a cave, do some main characters side quests, which are few in every new location, or do a mercenary job, (which is logical - you are a sword for hire, that's your job), or take part in war conflict and fight in a battle. 

If you want to fly through this game's main story in a linear fashion, and if you cannot immerse yourself into this world and a life of a mercenary who needs to make a living besides seeking family reunion or revenge, you will experience this level wall everybody is talking about.

I just enjoyed the game, traveled a lot and did only the stuff I wanted to do, and my level was never lower than next main quest requirement, not even mention ""being forced to grind"". There is just so much to do in this game. If you will face this level wall it means you are not fully utilising what this game has to offer. It is not a one evening game. After 115 hours I only made one playthrough finishing all main quests branches, doing all the achievements, but that's far from completionist. There are lots of main characters with golden exclamations signs on the map waiting for me, there are many pieces of unique items still hidden, there are many beautiful and intriguing places (even ""historical"" ones) I haven't visited, which are not limited to ton of question marks.

I can agree with grinding only if you want to upgrade every item each time you level up, and that is not necessary.",True,1539601823,1540274105,True,10,70,0.745789051055908203,False
0,319,29,4695,1411,76561198025949530,0,english,False,45278806,"PLEASE CONSIDER THIS REVIEW TO BE A ""YES, BUT..."" KIND OF THING!

[spoiler] So, it turns out in this game that the father of the protagonist is in fact someone special. With all the knowledge from previous Parts of the AC series in combination with greek mythology and heroes, one may now assume that means the character is in fact a true heros, a demigod (or in this case half-precursor). Well, that is not the case. He/She is the child of Pythagoras, the philosopher and mathematician. While he is a significant person still today, this REALLY took me out after hoping for a true mythological background, being a big fan of ancient myths. So for everyone who is familiar with Perseus, Herakles or even percy Jackson, you are not in for a treat. And I must say, I see no particular reason for this decision, they had the mythological ""precedence"" and the perfect opportunity to appease the kind of myth-versed audience, but they blew it for some reason. And please don't tell me it was necessary for story-related reasons, they could EASILY have worked with the other premise. Up until the reveal I was fascinated and wanted to know the truth, now I am taken aback and will likely take a break for a few days to cope with the immense disappointment stemming from their massive buildup only to drop the ball at the end. That REALLY took me out of the whole game. 

In case you are wondering what made me think that in the first place:
1) The character's close bond with an eagle, that is even commented on in the game many times; the eagle is - next to lighting - THE symbol of Zeus (and Zeus having a theme of bonking human women, so he'd be the perfect father-candidate).
2) The supernatural combat abilities, that can not be explained in any other meaningful way.
3) The incredible buildup as if pointing towards a truly monumental reveal.
4) General familiarity with greek mythology, where most of the true heroes are demigods.
5) Having to kill many of the mythological creatures that in canon have had their asses handed to them by one or the other demigod heros (Herakles for more than one of them).[/spoiler]

That out of the way, this game is NOT an Assassin's Creed, at least not in the way the brand was set up over a decade ago (even taking into account more recent changes). Everything from the levelling and skill tree over the equipment to the map and exploration experience is more akin to a Witcher 3. On the plus side, this means there are dialogue options, so jippie to that.

The story is somewhat dull, the character not bad but also not really good, but the world is fantastic. Everything looks beautiful.

The graphic designers really gave their best in many cases (and I say that as someone with a degree in Archeology); still too many statues are white, though (only about ~40% are painted in the game). Obviously liberties have been taken, but mostly due to the necessary scaledown of the land (riding for kilometers on end would likely only appease 1% of the playerbase, so everything but certain areas needed to be reduced in size: Athens is huge, but by no means as large as a real city, whereas the Acropolis there is about 1:1 approximately). There even are a few tidbits hidden in plain sight the unschooled eye might miss, such as the Boxer at Rest statue standing (or rather sitting) in several cities in the game.

The combat includes battles for the domination over a state (either by Sparta or Athens) that you can take part in. And no, they do not fight in the Phalanx. And I get why, this would have required an entirely seperate combat system for those battles.
Speaking of combat, while the older parts of the series may have presented the protagonists as somewhat superhuman, this is WAY out of proportion in Odyssey [spoiler] further hints towards possible demigod status? NOPE[/spoiler], like being able to create flame on your weapon, raging, kicking enemies (in a funny 300 reference) so far as 30 meters, firing remote-controlled arrows and such. Interesting, but about as grounded as a balloon. It COULD have made sense, if only...no, I'm not dropping this yet.

Now normaly this is not a problem as most games have an easy way of getting around even without fast travel.
Unfortunalty, this is not one of them.
The horse is stupidly slow inside all cities and villages to the point that it's faster to just run.
The ship takes forever to cross the sea between the 15+ islands and there is so many pirates that ""Scales"" with your level, so upgrading your ship is pretty much useless.

But to get back on the point.
I diden't mind most of these things but what put the nail in the coffin for me and is causing me to not recomend this game is the shoody game mechanics and ubisofts terrible bug fixing.
The fast travel problem has been here for over 1 week and all i have gotten from Gubisoft is ""We are looking into it""
Geee Thanks guys, that's very helpfull.

And to top it all of several quests like hunting the Kreatin bull is incompleteble due to it falling through the world and being unlootable.

All in all i will give this game
6,5/10 for story
3/10 gameplay
8/10 Kassandras looks
1/10 costumer support

RE: Exp grind
There has been plenty of criticism about the exp grind and stuff. Personally, I don't find that to be the case at all. I hit max level about 65% into the main quest, and I'm not even OCD about completing every objective before moving on. If you do a couple of location objectives / sidequests alongside the main quest, you shouldn't have a problem with exp. There are also plenty of repeatable (albeit boring) 'side quests' that offer a ton of exp for something simple, like killing an NPC or delivering an item.

RE: Microtransactions
I'm someone who's quite liberal about spending on lootboxes, but I haven't felt the urge to make a single microtransaction in this game. I was worried that the game was balanced around microtransactions, but upon finishing it I can say that I haven't spent anything extra on microtransactions, and have needed nothing from the cash shop to thoroughly enjoy the game. 

RE: Resource grind
Resource cost for upgrading gear is pretty insane. If you're upgrading your gear at the blacksmith every level for some reason, then yes, you will run out of resources. However, gear upgrades drop all the time in the game. If you replace your gear with upgrades that you find (like in a regular RPG), and only upgrade your ""endgame gear"" when you're near/at max level, then resources aren't much of a problem.

Pros:
+ Kassandra <3  
+ Overall, the 3 'main' plot lines were interesting; they kept me intrigued despite the length.
+ Really large game, huge map, good amount of content and exploration, long quest chains.
+ Beautiful graphics!
+ Plain FUN: Sparta-kicking people off cliffs, scaling every imaginable surface, chain assassinations, blowing people's heads off with arrows that hit like cannonballs, naval battles, investigating a cult, etc. 
+ Romance options are mostly hilarious. They're definitely shallow as far as RPG relationships go, but the blatant flirting and general horniness from the MC/NPCs make me laugh every time. 
+ Voice acting is pretty good overall, although there were some moments where I felt like the voices were over-dramatised.
+ Kassandra <3  

Cons:
- Illusion of choice: Unlike 'full' RPGs, only a handful of options throughout the dialogue actually has consequences.
- Some of the animations look a little clunky / repetitive
- Personally, the endings / conclusions of the main plotlines were kind of a let down for me. The journey definitely >>> the destination in my case. This was the biggest flaw for me, because I had so much fun during the 100 hours of gameplay, only to be let down at the end by a mediocre ending. YMMV though.
- Replayability: Considering that dialogue options matter so little, I wouldn't be replaying it to see different outcomes. I also haven't seen much of endgame content at the moment.

[b] STORY: [/b] I found the story to be pretty decent honestly. There are a few standout moments and I'd consider it a step up from Origin's discombobulated tale of revenge. For the most part I found the story flowed nicely and had enough to it to keep me interested throughout the experience. The only real issue I have with this aspect is that the ""endings"" of the game from the most part are wide open and I didn't get a real sense of closure from them. Side quests often have little stories attached to them that can be very interesting and I personally enjoyed the side quests. I was very impressed with the amount and uniqueness of origins side quests and it's much the same here so I'd recommend not ignoring them.

[b] GAMEPLAY: [/b] Gameplay isn't the best in any game ever but it's also not the worst. The basics from origins are still there, (except for shields which is replaced by an active parry system.) along with some new edition that I feel really improve the gameplay over origins. There is the edition of armor pieces with unique stats that go alongside of the weapons we had in origins that further increase build variation. On top of this you have the new engraving system which lets you add a stat of your choice onto any given weapon or armor piece. This synergizes with the talent tree to give the three different build types a very unique feel. Hunter which focuses on the bow and ranged combat, Warrior which is close combat and battlefield control Focused and finally Assassination which is your traditional stealth tree that focuses on trying to get instant assassinations and going undetected. All of these trees also synergize very well with each other, even more so considering most skills in the trees do not have a minimum amount of points spent in the tree to unlock them, allowing you to mix and match as much as you like. Most other gameplay aspects are exactly the same. There is the inclusion of naval gameplay but I feel this is mostly for traversal. Some missions will require naval gameplay but you'll spend far more time on land. The naval gameplay is much the same as Black flag with the editions of recruiting enemies to your crew resulting in stat boosts and the new naval fire build up system where you do damage to build up a meter that will then allow you to unleash fire attack versions of your normal attacks. There is also a new exploration mode that I feel adds a new layer to exploration gameplay as you have to use clues on most quests to find location. This can be quite fun but it's a little easier than I'd like it to be. Overall the gameplay won't blow your socks off but it's a very nice system that I feel gives enough variation that it doesn't become overly boring or repetitive.

[b] PERFORMANCE: [/b] I think it's safe to say the PC performance is subpar but with a decent PC it will get you where you need to go. I run the game at a semi-stable 60 fps with some dips in the big cities. I have everything at max settings except anti-aliasing, volumetric clouds, shadows and ambient occlusion which are all on low. I'll list my specs below if you'd like to compare.

[b] MICROTRANSACTIONS: [/b] Yes there are microtransaction in the game as most of you probably know. While I don't like microtransactions in premium games, here they are mostly cosmetic and don't interfere with the game. I've seen other people complaining that the game can feel grindy without the money and experience boosts but with my time with the game I didn't buy or use the free boosts and I didn't feel a grind at all. The only people who might have an issue with this are the people who just beeline the main story. Personally I don't see why someone would ignore more than 50% of the game but that's just my opinion.

[b] CONCLUSION: [/b] I have to say I very much enjoyed my time with Odyssey and I may even do another playthrough. In spite of the microtransactions and the subpar performance I think Odyssey is very much worth the 60 USD price tag. I never found myself bored and it kept my attention throughout the entire experience which is a lot to be said considering the games length.

Like Origins a huge amount of the game is just walking / riding from point A to point B.

It develops the ideas and mechanics of Origins. 

Brief pros and cons:
+ The gameplay feels more solid with much much more things to do comparing to Origins. You really feel the desire to explore the world.
+ The world size is just enormous. I have no idea how much time you're gonna spend exploring this but according to my calculations it'll be much more than 100 hours.
+ Graphics is just wonderful, especially comparing to Origins. Also, this game has the best water I've seen.
+ Combat system is definitely improved. Althought it's still clunky, all these special abilities like Spartan Kick makes combat system quite enjoyable.
+ Dialogues, acting and cutscenes. It's a huge leap forward comparing to any previous AC game. Face animation is still quite poor though.
+ Story, of course. Some plot twists will make you say ""wow!"", believe me.

- Optimization. It's bad, very bad. In Origins I've had solid 50-60 fps on ultra settings on my laptop (1050ti 4gb, core i7-770hq). Whereas in Odyssey I have ~30 on ultra (average). On high settings without AA it's playable, though.
- Grind. Be ready to grind. A lot of things in this game depends on grind, sadly.
- Strong Ubisoft urge to make this game Witcher-like.

After more than 100 hours of gameplay I would like to share my opinion, without spoilering anything about the story.

[u]Pros:[/u]
1. An immersive, long and interesting main story which takes about  30-50 hours.
2. A very big and detailed world with almost way to much to do and discover. If you want to do everything it will easily take about 70-100 hours or even more. So better tell your friends and family that you don't have that much time.  
3. A beautiful underwater world with sharks, a lot of fishes, manta rays and wals.
4. The sea combat from AC III, black flag and rogue is back. You can upgrade your ship and always hire a crew.
5. The voice actors are amazing. I've played with Kassandra in german language.
6. The soundtrack is like always amazing. ( Especially the different version of Ezio's Family.)
7. A lot of features such as the photomode, an egale to discover the world, automatic walking, which I used quite a lot.
8. It does have achievements and trading cards.

[u]Neutral:[/u]
1. The graphics. Don't get me wrong it does have very good graphics, but some textures don't look well. Trees and grass at far distance looking garbage. Some animations looking weird, heartless and pretty garbage! Especially in some side quests where they only shake there heads. Some graphics are really beautiful better than in origins, but some are not. I think that I've enjoyed the origins graphics more especially the syncpoint views.
2. It's great to have a choice to choose what's happening in the story. I do like it much more than just to have a linear story even if it is not that great like in other rpgs such as in the witcher. And that's the problem. The most choices does not have an long term impact at all.
3. They trying to do more with the abstergo story. It's ok, especially considered to everything after AC III, but sadly not that good as the desmond story which I really enjoyed.
4. It's great to choose the gender to play as a female or a male, but it does not effect the story or any stats like a male is stronger, but not as agile as a female.
5. The merchenary system/wanted system is good. It reminds to the previous AC parts and the GTA wanted system and the shadow of war/mordor nemesis system. It's a very nice idea, but I often felt interupted at discoverying.
6. The romances are ok, but pretty pointless. Mostly it's just an one night stand and nothing more.
7. It's very nice to have the ability to weak a region and fight for sparta or athens, but the problem is that it is way to repetive. It's always the same and gets boring after a while tbh.
8. The sidequests getting better and better, but it's mostly the same thing gameplaywise, kill this person, steal something, talk to a person and so on.

[u]Contra:[/u]
[u]The technique:[/u]
1. The PC port isn't that great. It does have a detailed graphic menu like in origins, which other games do sadly not have. Every setting explains what it does, but sadly the game isn't that great optimized. Most settings barely boost your fps. I'm getting a stable 60 fps at almost max settings. I've tested it on different cpus and my gtx 1070. This is definetly not that great especially considered that it does need 10-20% more performance than origins, allthough it doesn't look better. I hope that future updates does improve it. Everything else was fine for me. I didn't have any serious bugs, it didn't crash or frooze. The loading times on a ssd are fine.
[u]Balancing problems:[/u]
2. I do not understand why the level cap is forced. I don't like it some people may, but me not. So why is it forced and not like in origins the players choice to use it or not? 
3. Leveling up is almost pointless. The only reason to level up is to be at at least 3 levels under your enemies to even have a chance to defeat them. You never feel dominant at all.
4. The Combat in general is good, but does always feel like the same. Dodging is 90% the better choice than blocking attacks, which does make it pretty pointless.
5. At some parts of the main story you have to do a lot of side quests to level up. It does throw you out of the story, which is really bad. Why do you don't have the choice to do what you would like to do?
6. Teleporting is much worse than in origins. You can't port anymore to discovered cities, which means that you have to walk/ride a lot. You can only port to syncpoints. It wouldn't be that bad, but greece does have a lot of hills which means that you have to climb a lot.
7. No shields. C'mon. Just why? Antic greece and you can't even wear a shield? It's more than dumb. You can even block attacks with your sword. So what's the problem to just put a shield instead to give the player the ability to play as she/he wants?
8. I personally do love stealth games it's one of my favourite genres. The hidden blade aka leonidas spear is a bit to weak in the early game if you do not have a decent assassin skill boosting gear. I don't like it that much if  you can't sneak into a fortress and kill everyone like an assassin.
[u]Microtranslations[/u]
9. In my opinion it's not that horrible like a lot of people do complain about. I've ignored it the whole time and progressed pretty fast through the story and you can collect orichalcum  to get some things from the store with luck, but of course it's defintely nothing which belongs in a full price game!
[u]Grinding[/u]
10. The grind is real. For real. Lol. I personally do not have something against grinding, but it's way to much. You have to upgrade your gear like every 10-20min to get way better stats. A lot of early legendary gear is useless at the beginning if you already get something better that fast.
11. You have to collect way to much resources. Upgrading your gear is extremly overpriced and not even worth cause you always get something better.

Tip to boost your perfomance:
If you switch the volumetric clouds from max to high it boosts your fps a lot by no visual difference. I'm getting about 7-10 fps more.
Tip to level up ""fast"":
Just accept every quest which you can get at the board if you discover a new city. A lot of side quests are similar so you can mostly do 2 or even more quests at the same time.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Well, I do like every AC game. I do think that every part does have something special and their up and downs. It's also my favourite game franchise. That's also a big reason why I wanted to wait until I've finished almost the whole game before I do share my opinion. I had and bet that I will still have a lot of fun with this game.
[u]Is it the same as origins?[/u]
In my opinion it's very similar to origins, but much more to do, new and improved things, except things as graphics and performance. It's the better game and not exactly the same.
[u]Is it still an Assassin's creed?[/u]
Yes and no. No hidden blade, no assassins and no templars. So No. How could it even be? It's before the brotherhood has been created. BUT why yes? Well, in my opinion it's still an Assassin's creed even if it is not the same feeling as for an example in the Ezio Trilogy, cause of the antic artefacts and present story.
[u]Which version should you buy?[/u]
Well, the ""Early Access"" of the Gold Edition is already over, so there probably don't might be a reason to buy it right now. I bought the Gold Edition and ofc you can still buy it, but you could wait until the dlc's are released to buy the season pass seperatly. The season pass includes the 2 upcoming dlcs and AC III and Liberation remastered. So imo it's totally worth the money. I don't see any reason to buy the special or ultimate edition. Imo it's just a rip off. So just go for the normal or gold edition.

I will try to update this review after a upcoming big update.

If you should still have some questions feel free to write a comment or send me a message. There is definitely more things to talk about, but sadly you can't write more in the review.

Odyssey has side quests but the world isn't just littered with little redundant BS things that have no substance. Everything you do in this game feels interesting and fun, not like a grind.

I am only about 24 hours into the game and I have very hardly scratched the surface of what there is to see. I am playing on Nightmare difficulty and I find it very rewarding and challenging, but not ridiculous. (until you have 2 or more mercenaries tracking you)

The world is gorgeous, combat is fun, and they have definitely livened up their game with a nice mixture fo RPG elements while still maintaining the things that make a game feel like your playing an assassin.

Iv always wanted to pick up every AC games simply because I love history and playing trough different time period seems fun. I always hesitated picking up the titles though so I never ended up doing it. Except for this title ( also received AC 3 for free ).

But its a game after all so whatever, I went on to find out I really hate the combat system. Thats what stopped me from enjoying the game.  I would love something more real, for exemple, Kingdom Come: Deliverance. 

Well anyway the story seems okay but I didnt see enough of it to really talk about it. 
The stealth system is shit like most stealth game. Hide 2 meters in front of the enemy and you will be okay. Kill someone right beside another enemy, as long as he isnt looking at you, and you are okay. And even if they are looking at you, you still got time to go unseen sometimes.

However this game deepens in the first civilization history, so in a certain way it innovates the already known concept of assassins and templars teaching us how the world knew the existence of the first civilization and its interaction before the creation of those orders. Now I will analyze the most important concepts of the game:

 - As far as history is concerned it's good, it keeps your interest until the end although it can be a bit repetitive, but this is normal in any game with so much content.

- The combat system is quite dynamic, with different types of skills and different kinds weapons.

- The cinematics are well worked, especially those of combat. The new system of dialogues implemented lets you make decisions that really have an impact on the world, without creating a false illusion of choice.

- The game is well optimized running at 60 fps.

- The graphics are very similar to Assassin's Creed Origins, with some slight improvements.

As my personal recomendation, if I were you I would choose Kassandra as main caracter. The facial animatios and voice actor are better than Alexios's.

Pros: 
-Very different and refreshing entry to the franchise
-Many things to occupy yourself in rather than the main questline providing tons of content
-The naval aspect for the most part is very well done

Cons:
-The animations on deck while sailing in this game are annoying because they just stand there like toys
-I wanted more life skills to do in the ocean like maybe fishing
-No cool assassins order (I know this takes place before the creed was made)

Addressing the retards:
""The main quest line gets too many levels ahead of you""
A: You don't play RPG's right, if you only do the main questline of course the levels are gonna stack up. THE POINT is to explore and do sidequests, stop putting down a game thats making you do more than the main quests.

""Oh no there is dlc, instantly bad game""
Tons of other games have done this but you're too blind circle jerking it to the hate train of ubisoft, Never once have I or many others felt the need to buy the timesavers, If you do feel the need, you're probably one of those dumbasses that only do the main questline and nothing else, thats your fault.

I few things that bothered me about the game:
-The controls kinda annoyed me because I just wasn't used to them but they're easy to adjust
-The overpowered spartan kick can make you a god and can make any boss battle go from a hard fought fight to a 3 second kick off a ledge.

I don't mind, and even enjoy, a certain amount of grind. But this level of grind is a game breaker for me. Despite breaking down virtually all non-legendary gear and buying  materials from blacksmiths, I never have close to enough material to keep my legendary equipment current. To upgrade a  legendary torso to level 38 costs 442 iron, 885 Soft skins, 133 obsidian glass and 8846 of the currency. It's the same cost regardless of whether you are upgrading a level  16 torso or a level 37 torso. You get soft leather by hunting animals and a deer gives you 3 soft skins. Even the larger and less common animals such as the lion or bear only yield between 10-15. You do the math. It's a brutal grind. 

The RPG aspects of the game are strictly based in the gear the character wears. We invest time and resources kitting out our gear to develope a character and then are forced to wear other non-legendary gear that may or may not fit in with the RPG character we have developed. Or . . .  we can pay real money for resources. I mentioned earlier that a level 38 torso requires 885 soft-skins. It will cost you $10 to get 420 soft-skins, 420 iron and 14 obsidian glass. $10 will not get you enough materials to level a 38 torso! Including weapons, we wear 8 items, and I've only talked about the torso, admittedly the most expensive piece to upgrade.

PROS:
Map is very huge with tons of content( 100+ hrs) and so many wildlife
Amazing armours and weapons with so much detail 

The main story is somewhat okay enough to keep me interested. Better than Origins
Some good, funny and well written side quests

Eventhough the soundtrack is not as good as the Origins, still its very good 
""Naval combat is back ""

The game looks pretty in 4k with lush vegetations and mountain areas but i recommed to lock the game on 45 fps for smooth. no stutter experience.

Cons:
I said map is huge but little to no variety in regions, its just copy an paste of the same area which stopped me from wanting to explore the map. Origins map is far better and great with so much detail and variety.

Upgrading your armour is such a pain the ass, as it takes a lot of resources which you can get by grinding(x 10) or purchase with real money ( triggered)

They tried to mimic the WITCHER 3s side questes but they fall short,9 out of 10 side quests in Odyssey are so repetative like "" go fetch these and kill the commander in the outpost'' but some are really great. I want more of those good side quests or only those good side quests

And what happend to the parkour system, its very boring. Not stylish like Unity. I want those back. In Odyssey, you can just climb on almost anything even on surfaces with no grip at all( takes me out of the game completely) 

And stop selling items in a single player game, its unacceptable !!!

I think they should reduce the choices to only ones that will impact future dialouge and events.

I'm not the biggest fan of the combat either, it is similar to Origins and it isn't at the same time. I hate the fact that there is no shields as I feel it is harder to block or parry incoming attacks. I also loved the 'Sniper bow' in Origins but you don't really get anything like that in Odyssey.

Origins started off being an RPG before Odyssey yet something wasn't quite right about it, the combat seemed kind of floaty yet it was still very good. Now Odyssey comes and makes it 10x better. The ONLY thing Odyssey doesn't have that Origins did better are exploring tombs but that's because of the scale Origins had with pyramids.

On high/medium settings the game is visually pleasing and honestly a wonder. Unlike other AC games there are a variety of environments that are different in colour design. Northern mainland Greece is full of lush forests with places like Lalaia being an incredible get-away point I'd go to holiday for while the southern islands almost feel like Origins with its yellow / brownish palette, every region and island has their own theme instead of a copy and paste. The performance was pretty alright as well, averaging 60 frames with RX 480 8gb and a i7 8700k while dipping to 45 when looking at a lot of the world from high points, I thought I had to upgrade my gpu early for this game but it proved me wrong.

The real reason people got bored of the old AC games was gameplay, every sequel didn't feel fresh, Revelations was a copy+paste of Brotherhood but with ottomans, not italians, Rogue felt like the diet pepsi of Black Flag. Odyssey makes everything just unique, yet not so different it's an entirely different game. Unlike old AC games you can't just walk up to the guards and spam counter for instant kills, whenever you parry an enemy they could dodge your counter attack, or another enemy could hit you out of it. The fact that enemies don't attack at the same time anymore makes it so you can't just nuke one guy down and ignore the others, because in the old ones at most two people would attack with one guy shooting, but always hitting his own guys.

I've tried a pure stealth build, a warrior build and ranged and everything is viable. You can only use a bow through the game and one-shot enemies before you get 100 meters close, assassinations let you straight up teleport across forts and you just feel like a badass. The most fun build I tried was using explosive arrows with multi-shot, being able to hit 8 people at once infinitely with bombs was so stupid I killed myself 3 times in a Conquest battle, but on the 4th try I ended up with 117 kills in under 30 seconds. I haven't even tried every skill yet or explored every region and I still feel like I'm not even close to 100%.

There are microtransactions in the game though, although one thing people forget is that they're optional. The weapons and armour sold on it have unique engravings ( enchantments ) that can't be found anywhere else, yet are entirely situational to specific builds and EVEN THEN might not be useful. I haven't bought a single thing, no xp or money boost and I wasn't underleveled at one point throughout the game, hell sometimes I was overleveled. There might be some people saying that there is a grind put in to make you buy XP boosts but that's because they try to rush the main story instead of actually doing a side quest which is right next to them, or even exploring the map. They're avoiding 60% of the game because of this and think it's forcing them to spend money, it's kinda sad.

Overall I think this is one of the best Assassin's Creeds you can get, if you're skeptical about getting it, grab Origins and if you like it you will definitely love Odyssey. Just ignore the modern day part of these games, they're filler when compared to the old games and aren't done well at all.",True,1539503280,1539503280,True,0,4,0.565768539905548096,False

Do not listen to the people saying this game is not optimized. Do not listen to the people crying about microtransactions. Do not listen to the people saying this is not AC anymore. This is the best AC game to date.

Not AC anymore - These people  are the best. They obviously haven't played this game. It is everything that makes AC great, and everything that it was missing. Stealth aspect is still there, mixed with black flag naval combat, and the most emmersive gameplay I've had in a long time.

I won't write an award winning review, i'll simply adress the biggest things people are complaining about. 

I'll start with this, if you liked origins or even gr:wildlands you're going to enjoy this game. It's a single player ubisoft game, they don't change the recipe very often you should know what to expect.

I see a lot of people complaining about the game being grindy but, having completed every single question mark on the map as i always do in these games, i can say that i had plenty of fun doing so and that it never felt like a grind and always more like i was exploring beautiful ancient greece.

About the sidequests, sure the gray ones are trash fetch quests which is why i just ignored all of them after about my first 10 hours of play, but the golden exclamation mark ones all have a decent background to them and they usually do a good job at initially showing you around a region. 
And no, your quest log won't ever look like the one Dunkey showed in his video, you have to purposefully go and fast travel to every contract board on the map, accepting every quest to get that many.

An amazing, rich, colourful and fascinating world. Where you'll create your own Odyssey. And so I did, after spending about 118 hours officially on my save slot, every hour was worth it. What made this game so great can be summoned up to, WOW!


[u]Story[/u]
The story in Assassin's Creed Odyssey is amazing, of course it's based of something every Assassin's Creed game does, FAMILY. So it's to no surprise that your Odyssey will be based on family. Of course it also allows you to seek out vengeance, fight for freedom and enjoy life with love. Either way, the story of Assassin's Creed Odyssey is breathtaking, interesting and fun. Sure it doesn't bring anything new, since many other games allow you to make your own dialogue. But it felt really smooth to experience a dialogue system like the one in Assassin's Creed Odyssey.


[u]Game World[/u]
The game world in Assassin's Creed Odyssey is quite literally HUGE, you'll traverse mountains, beaches, forests and so on. Of course it's packed with the secretive question marks and many things dotted around the map. The game also allows you to chose 'guided mode' or 'exploration mode', this will directly tie into the game world and the map. Another big part of Assassin's Creed Odyssey is on the ocean, where you'll spend a fair amount of time on. Searching the depths of the mysterious Greece. Although it's nice to see this again, it wasn't as big of a feature as it was in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag or Assassin's Creed Rogue.


[u]RPG System[/u]
The RPG system in Assassin's Creed Odyssey is familiar, aspecially if you've played The Witcher 3, Dragon Age or Skyrim. And to be honest I'm not a big fan of this system. Well not in Odyssey at least. It felt overwhelming, annoying and boring. For someone who's been there through every Assassin's Creed title I'm used to the ""automatic"" combat system where you can counter the enemies moves and where every assassination is a kill on hit. And since Assassin's Creed Odyssey brings the full force of an RPG it's heavily based on your gear. Which means that the game will screw you over if you favour looks over stats. Even though I later on in the game chose gear with assassin stats it still didn't really allow me to be an ""assassin"".


[u]Realism[/u]
While Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of the most realistic Assassin's Creed game it has some pretty weird parts. One being no fall damage, while this has been answered by the developers it still doesn't make any sense. Their reply was that they dodn't wanna break the immersion for you, and sure it's nice to skip an additional loading screen when you die. But it also breaks the immersion if you jump 200m and don't die. And that's only the tip of the iceberg, the game has tons of stuff you wanna question but nothing game breaking.


[u]Combat[/u]
While I'm no fan of the RPG system in this game the combat is free flowing, to a degree. Which again is based on your gear, if you chose to go full on warrior for example. Then your hero will plow through the enemies like butter. Of course the game allows you to play with more playstyles, but the warrior path is definitely something I got to learn is very important. The reason why is because I found myself being detected more often than I wanted, which made assassinations completely useless. It felt like the game was tailored to being an all out warrior and not a shadowy assassin.


[u]Characters[/u]
In Assassin's Creed Odyssey you'll meet many interesting and curious characters, and a lot of them are directly pulled from the history of Ancient Greece. You'll for example meet Socrates, Hippocrates, Pythagoras, Pericles and many more. And even though Assassin's Creed Odyssey is based of ancient greece, it certainly builds character story like nothing else.


[u]Length[/u]
If you're like me, a completionist, then your in for a LONG ride. Of course you can play however you want but if you aim to compelete the entire map, every single quest and collect every single achievement. You'll spend well over 100 hours, and that's with some parts being rushed. I also did the same while playing Assassin's Creed Origins, which is a huge shame, since both Origins and Odysseys world is worth spending extra time in. And to note, this is only the base game and the bonus missions for pre-ordering and picking the Gold Edition, meaning time will increase if you choose to the the contents on the season pass which will drop later this year and in 2019. There is also some free missions to come, so game time will be a lot if you favour to 100% your game.


[u]Your Hero[/u]
Assassin's Creed Odyssey allows you to choose your hero, Kassandra or Alexios. With the first one mentioned being female and the second male. For the first time in the franchise you're allowed to pick which gender you wanna spend your time with. And personally I chose Kassandra, mainly ecause she felt more alive. Something with Alexios just didn't seem right to me, but that's just my opinion.


[u]Romance[/u]
This time around Assassin's Creed Odyssey let's you pick the ❤ option sometimes with some characters. Throughout your Odyssey you'll meet about a dussin people you can romance, that is if you aim to complete every encounter, since some romances are tied into side quests. And it's finally an intersting game to play. It didn't bring a full love system but the where it's at now only means the next game will improve, hopefully.


[u]First Civilization[/u]
And of course Assassin's Creed Odyssey also adds the First Civilization side to the game. And this time you'll be directly affected by it's powers. Not only will you uncover more of the First Civilization but you'll also be tied into it's story.


[h1]Technical Side[/h1]

While Assassin's Creed Odyssey is the latest in the franchise, it's also not without issues. While I didn't have any game breaking issues I'm sure they exist within the game.


[u]Graphics[/u]
The graphics are stunning in Assassin's Creed Odyssey, how the ocean simulates waves, how the sun pierces through the leaves, how the foggy nights will make the world a scary place to be in. It's no doubt Assassin's Creed Odyssey takes home the price for being a graphical masterpiece. It really does make the world feel alive with this much detail.


[u]Bugs[/u]
Personally I didn't experience any bugs except one with a quest, which hopefully will be fixed in the future. But apart from that, the game ran very well. 118 hours and to not experience anything at all was a surprise to me.


[u]Perfomance[/u]
With my system I aimed to have a better looking world with some stuttering here and there. But no matter what, the game runs very well. This time around the CPU wasn't being tanked, which was a nice thing to experience. Other than that, Assassin's Creed Odyssey will run good if you have a semi new system.


[u]HUD[/u]
While I miss the small mini map, it's still a very nice game to play in without one. And once again, the compass is being used to only show minor symbols. This time though your left with options to fully customize the HUD to your own liking. Apart from that, every other detail of the hood was small and never in the way. Some aspects even went away once you were out of combat for example.


Assassin's Creed Odyssey, the game with many mysteries. Mysteries you'll have to face yourself. THIS IS YOUR ODYSSEY.

Long story short. There are over 30 regions in Assassins creed Oddysey but its a shame you do the exact same 4 activities everywhere

-Cities feel lifeless 
-Sidequests are glorified fetch quests
-World filled with only forts and lifeless cities
-Combat is repetitive and spongy
-Resource grinding is slow
-Money is practically useless in a game where u are a mercenary with the goal of getting money
-Parcour went from a carefully designed world to you can literally climb anything
-I quit before i got to midgame but heard there is a giant xp grind to continue the main quest
-Assassinations aren't even a 1 hit anymore
-Optimized like crap
-Microtransactions to help u through the xp grind

This game is damn great, I have never been an AC fan I actually just played it a few times and never actually owned one of the AC games I dont really know why, you know is jut one those thing that didn't happen, that being said I bought this one because I thought it was really cool to be a Spartan and fight all across the Greek world, and hell I was right.

PROS
-The combat and gameplay overral is great.
-You can either play stealth or go full Spartan kick simulator 3000 xD
-The world is huge and beautiful to explore there are many interesting places and historical locations on it.
-RPG elements are fun and addicting (items sets, upgrade of weapons, ship, etc).
-You can fight mythical creatures such as the Minotaur :D

CONS
-Required lvl for main missions is not that good since some people dont like to do side quests between main missions but thats up to you.
-Optimization wise I believe performance could be better, struggles to get 60 FPS with high settings.

The supporing/culist quests can range from generic to pretty epic (e.g. the minotaur quest) though.
Much stuff to do, if you get side tracked easily you will sink many h into this.

EDIT:  So after playing it for a while you get to see the grindy scheme behind it.  I kept playing because grinding this game was great since I just quit smoking, so it filled that empty time with empty tasks.  However, this game is another test to see if microtransactions have a place in singleplayer gaming.  I'm disappointed because it started great.  Still, I havn't smoked so I do recommend the game if you want to fill time with something you don't need to pay too much attention to.

Some of the big cons if you want a quick list of them are below:
1. Grindy to extremes
2. Reptitive nature
3. Majority of side quests aren't very fun
4. Characters are cliche and poorly written
5. Needs a companion system badly, something to make you feel for other characters
6. Pets (if you get the perk) get stuck or will watch you fight instead of entering combat
7. A fairly large amount of bugs, only ran into one game breaking bug though
8. Controls sometimes don't do what they should do
9. Obvious level and material structure based on paying to progress
10. Exploitable marksman builds (I had to stop doing it because of how easy it made the game)
11. Very poor voice acting
12. Not enough variation in character models


There are more but this sums up the issues I personally had, although every individuals experiences may vary.

0,319,2,346,0,76561197980913991,0,english,False,45253721,"  I feel like I should like this game. On the surface, it seems to have all of the qualities of a good third-person action rpg. It ticks all of the checkboxes for a decent Assassin's Creed. But I just don't. I can't help but feel like this game is a mix of mechanics that are all about 80% complete, and the narrative is just barely passable with tons of stilted dialogue and character interactions.

  For example, the fight with the Cyclops (a local crime boss with only one eye) was some of the most confusing and ham-fisted gameplay I've experienced all year. (minor spoilers follow) I am told that the Cyclops and his men have docked on a nearby peninsula, so I scout the area out with my magical pet eagle. It looks like a harbor swarming with guards and surrounded by cliffs. I determine that an approach from the cliffs near where the Cyclops is hanging out would be the safest and most effecient for assassinating him. As I am crawling along a waterfall outside the walls, I suddenly get thrown into a cutscene.

  The camera pans and reveals Cyclops drowning some guy because he called him 'Cyclops', which is apparently a name he does not like. That's when Kassandra, my character, casually strolls into the scene (when tf did she get over the walls?) and reveals the obsidian false eye that she stole from him (which was itself a stupid idea that I couldn't really object to). She then takes the eye and shoves it into a nearby goat's asshole and tells the Cyclops to chase after it. No joke. She actually did that.

  The game then drops me right in front of the Cyclops and all of his still living guards, and I proceed to run around like a lunatic trying my best to not die while slowly chipping away at their numbers. Eventually I succomb to the sheer number of guards and their arrows, but not before a particularly stupid moment in which Kassandra grabs a zipline instead of a ledge and proceeds to zoom to another part of the harbor with even more guards.

  I feel like that whole series of events exemplifies why I dislike this game. It tries so hard to be multiple things, and ultimately fails to be good at any of them. I mean, in a game called 'Assassin's Creed', I am unable to simply sneak up and assinate a guy because the game needs to get in its own way and show a cutscene where my character shoves an obsidian eye up a goat's ass. Combine moments like that with a clunky parkour system so full of context sensitivity that your character will often do things you don't want them to do, a derpy bounty hunter system in which the AI will sometimes glitch out and just stay in one place until it suddenly teleports across multiple islands to join one of your fights already in progress, and a mish-mash of rpg mechanics, some of which mean you must get your arbitrary stats higher that the other guy's arbitrary stats before you can actually kill him when you sneak up and 'assassinate' him. In an Assassin's Creed game. And that's by no means an exhuastive list.

  Add in all the microtransaction stuff too. Anyone remember when your single player games didn't have 3 ads on the main menu trying to entice you to buying stuff off their store, or XP boosts that give the developers a financial incentive to make the grind more tedious? All of these things together make me wish I could refund this game and buy it again when it is 50% off. Or just play the countless better games out there that actually have a cohesive design.

  And that's not to say I don't understand why people are enjoying this game. Despite all of the above, this game can be fun and it's packed with content. I just wish Ubisoft would drop the AC brand, make a new IP, and design the full-blown historical rpg from the ground up that they so obviously want to make. The AC brand should then be refocused on the whole 'assassin' part of the name and become more like a medieval Hitman, rather than a watered down Witcher that is confused as to what kind of game it wants to be.",True,1539458157,1539458157,False,0,33,0.606230735778808594,False

Sure, the writing isn't as good as the witcher 3 and ubisoft is clearly still struggling with the quality of the rpg elements and procedural questing systems and some things are rather unwieldy and need more balance work. I can think of tons of little annoyances, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the game as a whole. I expect my first playthrough will be around 120hrs. That's good value imho.

There are some critics claiming that it's grindy and that for it to be good you need to buy a booster. I'm going to say that that's not really true. You don't get to do all the main quests without doing anything else. Even on easy I'd expect it's impossible. But then, is that really neccesary? I think it's ok for you to need to do some sidequests to stay leveled, though this is certainly pushing the edge of what's enjoyable. Then there's other points, like the fact that this game has little to do with Assassin's Creed. That's true, but who cares? It's great in its own right. As a matter of fact it would have been even better without the questionable Assassin's Creed backdrop.

To be fair, this game doesn't really feel too much like a 'true assassin's creed game' at heart. I think that is one of the greatest advantages of the game if you aren't heavily invested into the series' modern day content or it's assassin vs templar based storylines. People are suggesting just dumping the eden/ancient isu content just for the sake of it being 'an assassin's creed game' and just making Odyssey a seperate game altogether. However, even if Ubisoft had wanted to do that with the game many people would complain either way that it's game systems were too similar to other titles in the Assassins Creed series. I would think it would be fairly hard to make this era fit into the shoes of the other titles without deviating away from the semi-historical depiction of the Peloponnesian war.

Assassins Creed Odyssey is a truly beautiful looking game with its artistic design staying very true to the period of Ancient Greece and its mythological depictions. The game continues the great action based gameplay from previous titles in the series while heavily enhancing the RPG elements first properly introduced from Origins. The ability to focus between three differing playstyles allows the game's combat to feel less repetitive and more refreshing as you cycle through the hefty content that is inside this game. The game's RPG components do not try to overwhelm you and keeps itself simple. Leveling, gear, skills and item engraving exist to make the game progression feel more meaningful. 

It's open world is truly monolithic, especially from the first time you scroll out from the starting island that you thought was big. The game feels like the incorporation of all the enjoyed elements throughout previous titles in the form of systems implemented such as sailing of the Adriesta, the mercenary system, cultist system and the exploration mode system. While some of these systems may feel half-baked or a bit annoying at times, they still add to gameplay in a meaningful way. The cultist system does make up a little bit for the lack of traditional assassin content by making you feel like an investigator, trying to rid the world of an underground organization that threatens the balance of the world.

Perhaps the biggest lull for the average user is the experience gain within the game. The game does not intend itself to be played as a heroic rush to the end to defeat the biggest bad guy - but instead as a stroll throughout its vast world. Experience gain is found through the completion of side quests & miscellaneous repeatable content, discovering tombs, exploring caves, conquest battles, assaulting forts and so much more. However, to many users this is where its greatest downfall may lie. For those that do not enjoy taking their time and experiencing a 'grind' through the forms of content Odyssey has offered you, you get gated from reaching parts of the storyline you wish to reach.

This is where Odyssey shows some of it's inconsistencies. Their team is still fairly new to this sort of free-form content. Making each and every side quest incredibly fun, unique and fitting of your character's status isn't an easy task. Especially across a world as big as theirs. For the most part though, side quests did actually feel unique and enjoyable, especially if you did not rush the game. Microtransactions have no strong compellent reason to be ever used inside this game in the average playthrough, outside of the 'time savers' section. From what I understand: People are going to be resentful that they have to pay an extra $10 or so to make their grind less of a pain, and I do think it should be in the power of the consumer to increase their experience gain without this payment. I however, do not blame the developer itself as I understand that they're obviously just meeting their publisher's outlandish requirements for a singleplayer game.

However, the lack of depth in many of the systems starts to show after a while of playing the game as you try to go for full completion. Conquest battles may seem great at first - and is a great concept, but is not executed as well as it could be. Conquest battles feel kind of gimmicky and just end up being you constantly getting 2v1'd, surrounded by 100s of people all doing their own thing. I can kind of get why it is the way it is because of engine limitations; but i cant help but feel like I want more. I hate to nitpick too, but, asset reuse is fairly prevalent throughout the game for many of the different outposts and faction camps. You end up realizing that a lot of them feel the same, thats because they literally are.

In short: The game's sheer amount of content in the time frame they had to develop it left it feeling average in certain parts of the game. Still, I love this game for what it has enhanced and introduced to the franchise in the form of the cultist system and general RPG features. The storyline and zone progression were quite enjoyable when I took my time with it and did not rush. The voice acting was overall fairly good with the exception of the stellar performance from the voice actor of Kassandra.

I was really looking forward to this game and I pre-ordered it with the Ultimate Edition that comes with only Epic crap, yes, the ultimate edition only gives you epic not legendary items... I loved the graphics and the story, but everything else is dissapointing at best.

Sadly has a lot of grinding and with it's microtransactions is a very pay to win game... The combat is very difficult when you have more than 2 oponents even on normal. Anything over 2 levels of you is almost impossible to kill, and you're never going to have any real advantage against enemies as EVERYTHING scales up everytime you level up which sucks! In AC Origins you could at least get OP because you could continually invest points into abilities which would eventually help you get an advantage in combat, this unfortunatelly isn't present anymore, instead you have a very badly designed spear of leonidas upgrade system that you can only complete after you killed all cultists, which means you've finished pretty much everything in the game, so what's the fucking point of upgrading it still? 

Doesn't have a dye system so you can't use different pieces of different sets and make it match, it lacks variety on the outfits colors, everything that drops that is a certain quality (rare, epic, legendary) will be always the same color scheme... I am sure they know how important looks are in a game like this and even if you buy the cosmetic packs like I did you'll still be dissapointed at how they look. Everything looks ok, but you'll get tired of it really fast. In a game that you have to put at least 100 hours to complete most things you'll be left wanting on this aspect. And unless you put in real money at the start, your character will look like shit for at least until you're like level 20 and can get a matching set with a matching color scheme. And even then, with how expensive it is to upgrade your items as you level up, you're better of learning how to use cheat engine to get materials and gold otherwise you'll be VERY frustrated.

It's a huge world and lacks more fast travel points where you actually need them. The entirety of Makedonia has 2 while some very small islands like Kythera have 4, a very BAD design choice. I don't need 4 fast travel points to get around in Kythera! I completed everything in it in 30 minutes, while to get anywhere in Makedonia it will take you 30 minutes... Feels like it was designed to waste your time rather than letting you choose where to spend your time. 

For some stupid design flaw you can't command your horse to jump, so you'll likely get stuck on the most idiotic places.

The microtransaction items called ""Time Savers"" aren't really worth it as you can't see them on the map WITH the game icons, so you have to be switching between map filters ALL THE F****** TIME!

I'm a bit concerned at this point, but I attempt to start it up once more. Crashes once again, at the same exact spot, right at the beginning, every time. Hardly even get to look at the game.

I take a look online to see if anyone else has had any issues and this is what I read: ""*Warning* Odyssey will NOT boot on PC if your CPU does not support AVX.""

Cons:
The main con is the microtransactions. They have no place in single player games and the XP boosters infuriate me even more.  The cosmetics are fine in my opinion, but items that change the gameplay are a big no-no. Take. Them. Out.
Another common listed con is performance. Personally, I have had no issues with my semi-modern PC, but do what you will with this information.

I've always found AC games immensely boring, but with this one (and I assume Origins, too) they went for a more RPG-style experience.

The open world is massive. There are enemies and animals to run into, side quests (that are actually somewhat meaningful) to do, and collectibles to... collect. The world feels alive enough.

The graphics are great, but you won't be running it on the max settings unless you have the best hardware out there. Basically, what I'm saying is the optimisation could be better. But I've certainly seen worse. If you're running a mid-range system, your best bet is to cap the framerate to anywhere between 30-60 FPS - which the game thankfully allows - and setting the graphics to around high. You'll have a great experience, because the game actually feels much better when you're getting a stable framerate compared to if you'd run it uncapped, which is a terrible idea for many reasons.

If you liked Origins - which I believe a lot of people did - then there's a pretty big chance you'll like this one, too. Definitely a cool game for anyone who's into Greek history and/or mythology.",True,1539440890,1539470118,True,0,2,0.54356849193572998,False

I've had UI elements disappear randomly (including my health bar, and tags above enemies - those are pretty rare.  Much more common is the popup information about inventory disappearing).  Another common bug is the eagle breaking so it can't be using to find tablets.  The game is also a bit too repetitive, and features microtransactions.  The item UI also makes selling large quantities of junk items (Which inevitably build up in your inventory) and buying large amounts of wood, to upgrade your ship, needlessly aggravating.

The map is also pretty bad - quests will often tell you what region they're in, but the map desperately needs a search function, given the large number of regions and the unimportance of the region and subregion names mean you won't be learning most of them.

Otherwise, it's a decent game, certainly more colorful than its predecessor.  The writing for the main questions and ""yellow exclamation mark"" is consistently good, the voice acting is fine.  The gameplay is just like the previous one, albeit with a more interesting skill tree, and a smattering of tiny new gameplay elements.

By way of establishing my AC street cred, my favorite installments of the series were Brotherhood, Black Flag, Rogue (cause I loved playing it from the templar perspective) and Origins, 

Some people may hate the new dialogue options but its exactly what the series was missing. I love the fact that I can customize my crew as well as my ship and the way I can chose lethal or none lethal approaches to many of the camps and side missions (for example if you dont want to kill fellow spartans you can just knock them out and recruit the captain/commanders and promptly dismiss them to get the ""kill achievement"")  I love being able to capture enemies and press them into crewing my ship so that one Merc or fort captain who I struggled to defeat can now fight for me on my ship.

The way the dual protagonists are implemented is great, much as I loved Evie, I hated Jacob and he felt like an annoyance I had to drag around. I cant get into spoilers but the way its been done in this game is excellent.

There are some bugs (still missing Evie as a LT but they are working on it)  but overall I love the way the series has gone, even if the siblings are not technically assassins I just find myself not caring, the trimmings are all there, the templar side is presented in the cult, the assassins side in the mercs.

The world is gorgeous, much as I enjoyed Origins, the sand got really depressing after a while and boring. I like the variety of scenery, the open water etc.

The combat feels far from the traditional hide and stab mechanics from older titles, and shoots from a more tailored approach, allowing a player to choose if they want to hack and slash, assasinate from behind or shoot arrows from afar. Where all these culminate into an overall great game, the biggest and most glaring shortfall is the level system.

You can progress through the story and quests without much trouble up until about level 25, but after that, it is a massive grind as subsiquent quests are suddenly suggesting you to be level 30-35. For example, the Minotaur questline started with a suggested level of 30, slowly progressing to 32 as you finish each task. At the very end, right before I jumped in for the final fight, I got the glaring red text that my opponent was 8 levels above me because the suggested level suddenly jumped to 40. Knowing how long it will take to grind to that level makes you (well, me at least) want to put the game down for a bit from annoyance. This happens throughout the later portion of the game.

Again, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a great game. Ubisoft does encourage signing up for Uplay but you get rewards just for completing acheivements for cosmetics and weapons that are mid tier. The grinding required can be tiring at times but since the side quests are decently enjoyable, it feels like you are backtracking rather than doing a chore.

EDIT-10/18/18
I've got about 33 hours in game now. Let me tell you, I think I've ONLY just scratched the surface of the potential of this game. I just dinged 15 last night. If you think that's a slow go that's because it is. I've been extremely lazy in following the story as I want to find EVERYTHING I possibly can. So, a few things that rock. Hard. 1. I finally opened up the Cultists last night. Wow. Now, there's another whole layer I wasn't even expecting. Seriously awesome stuff so far. 2. Your eagle. Well, as I found out last night, you can use your eagle to venture pretty damn far from you. I flew halfway around a continent just exploring, looking for a half buried giant (you may know) While doing so I took in what is, easily, the most gorgeous vistas AC games have had to date. Easily. Unreal the scope of this game. 3. The story is really good so far. I'm invested whole heartedly to see this through. 4. The land battles you can participate in. You can either defend or attack based on where you are at. Defending is easier and usually lands you 1 pick of epic gear. Attacking is another whole thing. Usually 2 pieces of epic gear and a much harder experience. Loving it. 

So, what's not to like you may ask. Well, not much, for real. I got an odd shadow flickering here and there. My horse will wall run on top of a fence sometimes. Sometimes you'll ""ping"" for goodies and the goodies seem to be buried in the world somewhere but nowhere where you can actually pick them up. 

One thing that seems slightly out of place sometimes. At least, for me. While it's an AC game and does so in a stellar fashion, how weird is it that you can wall climb while in full gladiator armor? That is just off. While I appreciate full stealth gear (which is great) I prefer going full warrior and kicking a$$ but climbing doesn't seem like something you should be able to do in plate armor. You know?

7. Most side characters are memorable and well written
8. You can play how you want. It is totally possible to be stealthy while raiding forts and enemy territories but invest in warrior skils so that you don't get overwhelmed during boss battles. 

Con's:
1, The grind is real - You need a lot of planning and patience to reach level 50
2. Some performance issues
3. Naval combat is not as good as black flag

NOTE: Its highly possible that the grind exists to sell the XP boosts but this is how any RPG plays out.

This game is amazing. It's overwhelmingly atmospheric, you literally get lost in it playing. Graphics are wonderful and unlike many  other people I've read the feedback I don't have performance issues on Ultra so that's not a con I can account for.

Ancient greek, Sparta versus Athens.. something evil lurking in the shadows, pulling strings. Family issues. Mythical creatures, conquest battles and beautiful landscapes. Tidy up forts and leaderhouses to trigger epic battles where you decide who comes out victorious. Quickly switch from Assassin to Warrior gear once you grow tired of lurking or screw up sneaking through the quest. Bring your leopard to the party. Kick people or other people's leopards off cliffs or any given highground. Slaughter mercenaries, bad dudes and soldiers alike, grind some gear (don't salvage or sell epic gear with good stats early in the game, you will regret it later on) and loot treasures. Take screenshots (F3 - I was clueless for so long) available to be seen by other people playing the game and vice versa. Kassandra can make love to other women.. behind closed doors of course.
This game has so much going on and so far I haven't grown tired of any of it.

Things I would like to see improved or did not like: my horse failing to gallop over a tiny rock, enemies sometimes vanishing in walls or mountains (to be fair, Kassandra packs quite a punch or kick rather), an overview containing stats such as overall crit values etc., maybe a couple less pirate ships trying to gang up on me as I'm trying to travel in between islands especially in early stages, the option to switch in between preset sets of gear.

I don't have a lot of bad things to say, it's a really good and well rounded game. It certainly reminds of games such as Witcher which at least I do welcome. Even the tiniest quests might matter, even a random blacksmith or villager can be your key to a crucial clue you are missing. The quests are well designed aswell. 

I like it and do not regret a single cent spent. And while we are at money, yes there is a shop for microtransactions but I haven't found myself in the need to purchase anything so far and I am pretty much done with my first odyssey. You will manage, there's plenty of resources. Salvage gear instead of selling, drachmae can be found literally anywhere unlike comparable amounts of mats. Think economically with obsidian glass as long as you don't have plenty.

I did purchase a controller to play this game but haven't even used it yet, meaning the controls via keyboard and mouse are better than I have expected (my first AC on computer).

Now, when i played through this game, and i have not done everything, the only thing that went through my head was that how much detail and work and effort went into the game, for example, they made the 'city' of Sparta into what all evidence suggest - the 5 cities surrounding it (all appropriately named and as close to accurate locations as possible) with a central Acropolis. They even placed the temples such as Artemis Ortheia and the Menelaion in the right locations, which I did not even expect to be in the game, let alone in accurate postions. This detail is everywhere it could be (within reason, I doubt there is enough evidence out there to place everything where it should be). The story was very good, very long too, I did not know where it would end, and surprised me when it did, as the story is split between the 'main' storyline, and the 3 other parts of your 'Odyssey' (I will not name as I do not want to spoil). 

-On to the stuff everyone complains about, I did not even know there were microtransactions untill i read the reviews - sure it says something about the 'shop' on the main menu, but i was too busy playing the game to bother with it, and all the items can be found in-game (as far as i've noticed). The 'grind' was not too bad, i always seem to have enough materials on-hand (whether from looting forts, buying off blacksmiths or de-constructing gear - yes you can do those for massive amounts of materials, rather than the silly stuff found in the wilderness) and the levelling was just right, although there were only two points in the story where my level was a few under the recommended, which i went off to do exploring and side-missions, which were actually quite enjoyable, if you mix them nicely with the story they don't get boring. 

-Performance-wise i only got 5-10seconds of frame drops every 10minutes at the tail-end of a long session, as my laptop started to heat up (it is a hard game to run, it looks beautiful though), but i have encounted no big problems. 

TLDR: Odyssey is an awesome, historically orientated game with excellent mechanics (Everything from Combat to Naval to the War etc.) and storyline, highly recommended if you enjoy RPG's, or just Ancient Greece and exploring. However, if you think this is an AC game, then you'll be disappointed - long gone are the Ezio days. Just give up on that hope, and treat the games as they are - decent games made by a studio, where the higher-ups are trying to make money, and the developers themeselves are able to make awesome games they want to do through the branding of AC. Win-win scenario in my books, as long as the games are actually decent. BUT that's just my opinion.

But I am happy that I was wrong, it has been an amazing game (in my opinion one of the best AC games to date) I love the story of the mercenary character, I love how open the map is and I really do like how they added choices into the game.

While in my playthough I tried to complete as much as I could like the cult, atlantis etc. One thing I respect from those missions is while they are technically part of the main story you dont need to complete them to finish the game only becuase of how hard they were to complete, the atlantis missions were hard to complete because while there was only 4 enemies to beat they were hard and with the cult there is something like 44 cultist scattered all over the place which would have been extreamly annoying to complete if you wanted to complete the game.

   the modern day story felt kind of weak 
   I completed the atlantis story quite early which kind of felt like i completed the mordern day stuff quickly 
 The ubisoft store, this is an issue because odyssey is a solo player game and yet if you want a nice looking armour you need to pay £5-10, or you could buy a small temporary xp booster which again if for a solo player game, its not hard to change difficulty if your struggling with enemies that are a higher level

Honestly ive found that I've truly enjoyed the vast majority of the game, and I would definitely recommend it if youre a fan of the franchise, especially origins. That said, the problems become glaring after a while, and you only seem to die from bugs that I just cant justify. Everything from Fazing through walls, to floating objects, to jacked up hitboxes on things like >>>BOARS<<< WHICH CANT TAKE DAMAGE FROM MOST WEAPONS BECAUSE THEY FADE THROUGH, to the inability to actually block attacks sometimes. This, coupled with the fact that only like 7 of the dozen or so abilities are even remotely good makes the game have really lackluster replayability. Like, No Man's Sky level replayability. A good example is aoe damage, where i start every fight with a single explosion and win. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and it feels like easy most. Not that anything but damage gets harder on higher difficulties. Additionally, the game has a big problem with its quests being mundane and repetitive, with rewards that dont quite match the difficulty. For example, I was asked to deliver a letter at level 45 and received roughly 45k experience points and a crapload of gold from it. At the same level, i killed a bandit leader and got like 3k experience and 300 coins. It was maddening taking on messenger quests to level up because it was the only thing that would get me to max level. Yes i could have not done these quests, but i feel i would have been level 30 upon completing the game otherwise. The diversity of flora and fauna is interesting and entertaining (with the exception of the buggy boars), but the ai for most of the animals, ie bears and lynxs, is better than that of the guards. And sharks are one of the most underwhelming enemies in the game for how intense i felt prior to actually swimming into them. It's so bad I feel like Dora the Explorer needs to point out where shit is for them. 

I want to end on a good note. Some of the graphics and asthetics, like the unicorn, make this game a beautiful masterpiece, and from a graphical perspective, I love this game.

You can definitely play the game without having to buy the XP boosters, although that is a negative in my opinion (no single player game should have microtransactions).  However, these do not make the game less fun for me, and the content is definitely worth the price.

However, I recently bought and played AC: Origins and enjoyed it despite the late-game grind, for the wonderfully detailed setting with remarkable verisimilitude, a relatable main character, and well-written quests that fleshed out the setting and the story. This set high expectations for Odyssey, which it regrettably failed to meet.

Where Origins did a remarkable job of crafting a believable Ptolemaic Egypt, Odyssey is lazy pulp. Here, mythological characters are real, the landscape is littered with twisted monumental statues, giant monstrous skeletons, and ""precursor civilisation"" ruins, Spartans have more in common with ""300"" than who they really were, and unpleasant characteristics of the Greek civilisations -- such as ubiquitous slavery and utterly oppressive patriarchy -- have been edited away. Instead of the warm and personable Bayek with his complex relationship to Aya we get tough-guy/gal Alexios/Kassandra, as clichéd action-heroes as things get. And the story gets weirder and weirder, dumber and dumber from the start.

The gameplay is somewhat improved from Origins -- where brawling was merely passable in the previous instalment, it's much more varied and satisfying in Odyssey. However, this gets old around the ""you have killed 100 enemies with a spear"" point, however you slice (or stab) it. Moreover, the MMO-style leveling completely neuters any sense of progression, as fighting on level 5 is much the same as fighting on level 50, since you'll be fighting enemies of the same level. Instead, it imposes continuous busywork, swapping and upgrading gear and grinding cookie-cutter quests (procedurally generated or otherwise) for XP.

I was expecting a step up from Origins. Instead, I got a small step forward in one limited area (brawling) and many steps back in the areas that made Origins fun. I could only take less than 20 hours of playing this before giving up: at the point where Origins was picking up speed, Odyssey already feels like a chore. Regrettably, I'm going to have to give Odyssey a thumbs-down. It's just lazy, grindy, repetitive, and frankly boring; the only thing it has going for it is an addictive core gameplay loop with frequent rewards, but then so does Tetris and that takes up a lot less disk space.",True,1539371346,1539371613,False,1,34,0.649656295776367188,False

Story: I find the story enjoyable thus far, I was expecting something bare bones, but there is actual story here. The player is able to make choices that can alter a story in some way shape or form, some larger than others. I havent completed the game yet, however its probably the only reason I am playing. The only complaint is now that the game plays more like an RPG/Adventure game, story missions called be level gated, forcing you to do ""skyrim level"" quests. By that, the quests usually are little more than ""go to this fort and find this item in a chest"" or ""Go over here and kill something"". This just bogs down the game substancially. I am only level 33 and played almost 40 hours.

Combat: This is the games achillies heel (pun intended). You see, the games combat system relies on getting better equipment from varying weapons (spears, two handed bladed, swords, daggers ect) to armor sets. As you level up you gain ability points which can be fun to use. You can get abilities such: the ability add poison/fire to your weapon, charge forward, sparten kick (like 300), rip an opponents shield from them and throw it at their head like a destruco disk, heal for a percentage of health, or unleash a large flurry of blows that depend on weapon type (daggers will strike a single target several times while hammers allow you to target a single opponent while being able to chain to 2 others). This is well appreciated and I enjoy the fact that you can choose a weapon prefference, though most of the time the damage difference is negligable.

So you get into a fight with some Spartan soldiers, one guy is duel wielding maces, another has a spear and shield, the other guy has just the spear. Combat usually revolves around you being able to attack when available and watching your opponents attempt to strike you, in which you can do one of two things. If their weapon glints like a sun striking metal at the right angle, you can perform a parry, allowing you to stun everyone in a short radius and open up those enemies. If the enemy glows red while attacking, the attack is unblockable and you can dodge, if you dodge at the right time, you can go into slow motion which allows you to get in a few attack or just get some distance.

Here we get to the part that has driven me to make this review, because it was absolutely rage inducing. You see, besides the average grunts you can fight, there are harder enemies (akin to mini/bosses) called mercenaries. Now these mercenaries will follow you to Hades and back. You gain a sort of ""wanted meter"" as you go about the world doing bad things, such as killing civilians, guards, soldiers, stealing, ect. These mercenaries are just like grunts, but have a bit of the nemesis system built into it, meaning they may be able to bring a pet bear with them to fight along side them, but may be weak to assassination attacks. Other than that, they are honest to god damage sponges, think of a boss that is reletively easy single handed, that you can easily fight one on one, but for some reason the developers decided to give him enough health to last 100 attacks for no reason. The good news is that they can drop some sweet loot, but you have to kill them and whatever buddies they decide to take along.

Here is what drove me to make this review. As I said I am level 33 by the time this mission is around. I am tasked with killing a man in a fort, this man is a cultist and a side objective. This fort has around 30 guards roaming around. I dont want to start a fight immediately and instead attempt to assassinate my way to a brazzier (which the guards can use to call for reinforcements, which you dont want). I have a bounty on me as the game forces one on me for this mission. In my head I am thinking ""there are no bounty hunters here, so as long as I am not seen no bounty hunters will show up"" my train of though being they would only appear if there were rumors I was at this for. Makes logical sense right? 

So I am killing EVERYONE in this fort silently and quickly. To make sure the bodies of the dead are not found, I carry their bodies and throw them off the edge of the tower to the forest below, where NOBODY will find them and summon bounty hunters here. I get about 80% through killing everyone when I see not one, not two, but THREE bounty hunters walk through the gate.

At this point, my plan to silently kill this cultist and complete my mission is screwed, because as soon as I would try to fight him, these guys would show up and screw me over. So I attempt to ambush them and kill them as quickly as I can (as quickly as you can kill a sack of health taking of as little as 3% of their health with an entire combo).

 I do just that, I get a sneak attack on one of them and then realize the odds are stacked agains me. Not only am I facing 3 people at one time, but I notice they all have different weapons. One guy has duel daggers with poison applied (daggers are extremely quick and hard to tell when its save to parry), a girl has the same sets of daggers with poison, and another is duel wielding maces (reletively easy). Now if that wasnt bad enough, they are all at 2-3 levels higher than me, meaning they soak up even more damage and deal more damage.

I down the woman carrying poison daggers and the duel mace wielder, and focus on the last enemy and I am more than ready to get this fight over with. Then I see on my map not one, not two, not even three, but 6 more fucking bounty hunters with varying weapons, attributes, and levels. I am beyond pissed off.

The fight continues, I somehow down two more, but now im not really fighting, im just dodging praying to mighty zues I dont get hit by anything. So while im fighting anywhere from 2-4 bounty hunters in melee combat (some of which decided to bring animals like bears and wolves) while the remaining enemies are chucking fire/poison grenades, shooting fire/poison arrows, or otherwise being a pain in the ass. As im fighting those in melee I cant even attack anyone because im constantly attempting to parry light attacks, dodge heavy attack, dodge arrows, dodge bombs, avoid poison melee attacks, avoid basically anything and everything.

On top of that someone has called for reinforcements and I am probably fighting 15 enemies at one fucking time, half of these people I am doing so little damage to, its like I am doing more damage to my controller by repeatedly hammering either the light attack or dodge buttons, and even when I do connect its the equivelent of throwing a satin pillow at a concrete wall, halariously ineffective. 

I end up dying, of course, taking out only about two more people. In total, assassinating everyone in the fort probably takes 10 minutes and the rest tas around 30-40 (I shit you not) and I had to do it, not once, not twice, but four fucking times because every time after I got in the fort, at least 3 bounty hunters show up, with even more backup on the way.

I eventually did beat it, but this huge fault in the game shows that the difficulty isnt in the enemies styles or weaponry or tactics, its sheer numbers. Games like dark souls usually have few enemies which are unique in their attacks, openings, or general strategies. Odyssey just fucking throw everything in the kitchen sink, the fridge, and the master bedroom at you and expects you to just be ok with it. I for one am not a fan of wasting nearly 2 hours on a single  MANDATORY mission, which is relatively easy but enjoyable, but arbitrarily made difficult by damage sponges.

Game is fun, but keep this type of stuff in mind, youll be seeing a whole lot of it.

Quests are more often than not XP and Gold grinds which have the player undertaking monotonous tasks such as delivering a letter from one place to another (of no consequence or overall story significance) or simply giving a small sum of Gold to a begger for an immidiate quest completion and XP payout. 

I despise Grindy RPG Gameplay such as the Whitcher (Difference here is you can cimb and properly explore areas, whereas in the Whitcher I felt incredibly grounded which I found to be a problem) where the goal is to ignore beautiful looking and rare Legendary pieces of gear in favour of STATISTICS, Assassins Creed Odyssey falls into this heavily with EVERY Item, Quest and Reward being level gated to your current level, one above or one below. Levelling up does not assist with this as Quests will dynamically scale up to your current level meaning you CANNOT be overlevelled for a Quest, you can however be often drastically underlevelled for one, resulting in HP sponge enemies that continuously 1 shot you. 

Around the 40 hour mark I found myself beginning to understand the game properly and after spending those previous 40 hours playing ASSASSINS Creed and following the ASSASSIN Skill Tree, I decided to swap for the vastly more powerful and easily exploitable Hunter Skill Tree. Following this decision I was 1 to 2 shotting enemies regardless of level and remaining undetected whilst doing it. After a few hours of tedious grinding I hit level 50 without having finished the main Quest (there are 3 main quests trees) and with this being the case I no longer had the need to grind unlimited amounts of side quests. I decided to start working on the more interesting and enjoyable Quests, which there are few of actual intrest and significance and seeing that there were mythical creatures in Assassins Creed Origins and in the Trailer for Odyssey I made the mistake of starting there. After completing the story arc I was greeted with the ending, needless to say I was rather dissapointed, it was vaguely interesting however tossed me back into the game despite the circumstances which had just unfolded. 

In conclusion (of this terribly structured review) I enjoyed the Assassins Creed Games for their beauty, characters, story and simple yet effective combat, sadly Assassins Creed Odyssey only has 1 & 1/2 of these things because of the everchanging gamer audience, the game is absolutely beautiful with its amazing setting and incredibly detailed environments however the characters, (Kassandra as my choice) felt flat and generally felt like the all too common 2018 Hero that cracks jokes and comments on the world (often talking to themselves as if theres an audience present) 24/7 who is a neutral character to save for player choice. The loss of proper custscenes making way for again the now everpresent IN GAME ENGINE CUTSCENES downplays often meaningful and impactful moments with stale and often laughable moments of stiffness in character and vocals and makes me question whether or not they care about their characters past Ezio's game series. I have not finished the other 2 story arcs as of writing this Review, however I assume it to be much the same, not to say I will not however I don't expect it to be anything incredible nor for it to not lead into another sequel containing many of the same problems.

EDIT: Finished the game and am only missing 5 Achievements which are mostly optional and secret content. Main story is kind of shit overall, Cult ending is interesting and ties the other games together with nice mentions (visual) and the Atlantas ending is not great. Overall dissapointed in the story elements of the game however I keep coming back to explore and change up my playstyle with the awesome gear and ability trees. Recommend this game for a time dump and definitely a wallpaper generator.

TLDR,
Not a true Assassins Creed Game outside of the world and story elements, flat characters due to 2018 game design flaws including poorly done in game cutscenes in place of proper structured cutscenes with depth and meaning. Terrible level gated content in all respects, cramming grindy RPG elements and microtransactions as ""Time Savers"" down your throat to make up for possibly intentional bad game design. If you grind to level 50 there is a fun time to be had with the Skill Trees and great customization options (of gear and weapons).

TIPS
1. Naval Combat can be annoying but easily exploited for good resource gains (Especially Wood)
2. Upgrade at least your weapon every level up as upgrade costs stack up quickly and the most important stat for levels is damage, armor from gear helps but is less important (as least early game).
3. ^ Following this, gear stats do level up with the gear but only every 10 levels I think.
4. Assassin Skill Tree sucks for the most part outside of HERO STRIKE which CAN BE USED IN COMBAT.
5. Top of the Warrior Skill Tree is a buff ability which buffs ALL damage by 35% which INCLUDES ASSASSIN DAMAGE (Trust me you'll need it)
6. Do the Arena when you can, it gives great XP if you can do it.

If you liked Origins, you will like Odyssey. A comparison made about this game is that it's essentially Witcher's Creed: The Wild Odyssey. The dialogue system is built the same way, and the story is improved upon- it's not ""Witcher 3"" quality, but it's better than Origins, and allows the player to make their own story based on the desicions they make. Personally I'm pretty gripped by the story and exploring Greece on foot or by ship has yet to get old- the map is beautiful and I still find myself excited everytime I discover a viewpoint. Graphically the game is amazing, I'm running an i7 6700k with a GTX 1080 and 16GB of ram, and I average about 55 FPS at 2560x1440 resolution. 

The on foot combat is just like Origins, although target tracking and hit detection is improved upon. You still have the same system for weapons and gear from Origins (including the P2W time savers and 'add-ons'), although the armor/outfits/weapon designs are much improved over Origins IMO. The combat tiself is... usually okay, but tends to become unstable in certain situations. The AI has aboslutley no issue goon swarming you, the lack of invincibility frames while dodging is going to have you running around a lot to try and get breathing room, and the camera has a tendancy to get jacked up in tight spaces like forts, ruins, or huge battles. The sea combat is right out of III/Black Flag/Rogue, with more stream lining and less loading screens during ship boarding animations. Sailings songs are back, in Greek, and will be sung by a male or female chorus depending on what kind of crew you pick for you ship. (My only complaint on this is that I wish the singing volume was a little bit louder.)

The biggest issue I have right now is with the Mercenary system. It's akin to Shadow of Mordor/Shadow of War, and while it's an interesting direction to go in, ultimatley it becomes annoying because I find myself having to pause my big scrambling fights to pay off a bounty every few minutes because the AI characters will just drop 3-4 figure bounties on you to try and get the Merc system to push you out of the fight. I don't like having to pay 3k ingame credits just to be able to finish clearing a fort without an equal level merc (or 3) showing up and spamming elemental/power atacks on me.

tl;dr- If you played Origins, but thought to yourself ""gee I wish I cared about this story"" or ""gee I wish the setting was a little more lively/colorful"" or ""gee I wish the combat was more refined"" or ""gee I wish Bayek wasn't such a flat, static bore"", you'll like Odyssey for what it improves upon. If you remain unconvinced, wait for a sale, but there's defnitley enough content to justify the $60- I've put 50+ hours into it without completeting the main story and I've maybe explored just over half of the map. There's plenty to do, but unlike Origins I don't find myself forgetting half of what I've done before I even finish the game.",True,1539356377,1539356377,True,0,1,0.519999980926513672,False

Now that we got the obvious out of the way, Assassin's Creed Odyssey is one of, if not the worst Assassin's Creed game I have played since I first fell in love with the original Assassin's Creed some ten years ago.  This game's development started at around the time The Witcher 3 released, and boy does it show, because Ubisoft has gone full Zeus and ravaged this series' identity and charm and replaced it with a soulless cash grab.  Almost every facet of this game is taken from some other game. The dialogue choices and the corresponding camera angle are taken directly from The Witcher 3.  The story beats and and pacing of the narrative are taken directly from The Witcher 3 (that woman you're looking for is in another castle, now here are some flashbacks of that person you're looking for).  The bounty hunter system is shamelessly ripped from the Lord of the Rings games.  
 
If that wasn't bad enough, Odyssey isn't even that good when compared to its predecessor, Origins.  Suddenly, enemis are super tanky, it takes forever to level up a single time, and upgrading gear now costs an arm and a soul.  Reflecting on why this game is suddenly a chore to progress through for even a nanosecond, it becomes clear that Ubisoft is turning AC into a F2P with a premium model.  Hope you enjoy doing those merc quests, because it's pretty much the only way to get legendary gear now, unless you're lucky enough to stumble upon a legendary chest (that isn't marked on the map) among the vertiable question marks littered throughout the game.  

Speaking of quantity over quality, Ubisoft apparently learned nothing from previous mistakes, such as turning this map into an arduous chore of checklists and completing sidequests simply for the sake of gaining XP to break through Ubisoft's hilarious notion of character progression and leveling requirements.  Enemies not only scale with your level, but any enemy that's three or more levels above you will be impossible to kill.  This creates a very restrictive barrier around the player that prevents any sort of real freedom, because no matter how much you level up, you'll always need to level up one more time to meet the game's stringent requirements.  Which again, is done to incentivize players to spend real cash on ""time-savers.""  This could have easily been remedied by stretching out the buffer between an enemy that is able to be killed and ""You're dead faster than you can blink"" enemies.  

I am level 19, and so far I have only come across three legendary weapons. This may not seem that bad, but when compared to Origins, Odyssey's loot system is terribly boring.  There is no real motivation to explore and open chests when that feeling of ""it will just be another blue or purple item"" is always there.  Ubisoft expects you to do all these merc quests that involve killing a bunch of people, taking over a bunch of camps, or destroying supplies.  Each of these quests gives out an average of 10 Orichalcum.  Considering you need 100 Orichalcum just to buy a legendary weapon from Sargon, it becomes plain to see that the grind in this game is depressingly overwrought. 

Game's writing is terrible too.  Characters like Socrates are shallow caricatures of historical figures.  Ubisoft apparently thinks intellectuals actually talk like this in everyday conversation.   

""Thank you Alexios for doing this errand for me  By the way, what do you think of man's seemingly innate inhumanity to man?""

This is just one of many examples of shoddy writing that I have come across.   The story so far is also terribly paced, and for the past two hours, I feel like I've been doing nothing but busy work for people when all I'm trying to do is track down someone.  One main quest involves talking with Hippocrates.  I got his location, come across another NPC who tells me that Hippocrates isn't here, I need to go over THERE.  I grab the horse over to the new location, and then Hippocrates tells me he's too busy, so he sends me ons ome errands of his own.  I then have to talk to three different people, each of whom have their OWN errand I have to perform.  When you're playing this game it almost feels like you've died and gone to some gamer-equivalent hell where you're forced to do fetch quests in this never-ending torture of ""just one more thing and then you can get some catharsis.""  

Ubisoft has completely forgotten what made Assassin's Creed fun and intersting.  First they took out the modern segments, and then they replaced the protagonist with Layla Hassan, who is one of the most insufferably written female leads since Aya (yes she supplanted Bayek as far as I'm concerned). They have reverted to putting a metric ton of markers on the map and forcing the player to completel all of them just to get through the dumb level requirements. Very little story, too many fetch quests, grindy gameplay, atrocious writing, and is almost worse in some instances when compared to Syndicate.

0,118,10,4101,411,76561198233849576,0,english,False,45228172,"AC Odyssey is a really fun game to play. That'll be the first thing I tell people when they ask how my experience is with it. 

Unfortunately, it falls prey to the same things recent AC games have, but to a lesser degree. It lacks a lot of polish. The graphics aren't up to the standards of say Kingdom Come: Deliverance, Spider-Man, or [insert fairly new game here]. The story is cool, but very, very predictable. I found myself not surprised by literally every plot twist, every character's actions, and every big scene. What the game does well is deliver a beautiful atmosphere that makes you feel a part of the Greek world, and takes you on an interesting (but again, predictable) journey through it.


Pros: Great atmosphere/immersion, beautiful music, fun characters, a 'choices matter' system with fair concequences, memorable villains, few glitches.

Cons: a frustrating combat system featuring unblockable/undodgeable hits, inprecise timing, slow player to difficulty scaling, poor keyboard mapping that cannot be customized, and a lot of ""really, I survived all that just to be killed by this"" moments. Again, a very, very, very, VERY predictable story. Like wow. It's still interesting to see the character's develope through the game's events and the player's guidance, but it refuses to throw anything new at you. Lackluster romance options, an ungodly amount of grinding required to keep your armor and weapons on par with your level due to the game's terribly balanced crafting system Microtransactions that boil down to ""pay more money so you don't have to grind for five hours to upgrade your ship, weapon, or armor"". A terrible ending to the story that leaves you feeling stopped short of your character's goals, only achieving one of the 3 overarching goals the game sets you up with. Even with the ""good ending"" you end up feeling underwhelmed, and unaccomplished.


Overall, the game is fun, the atmosphere is cool, the characters are delightful, but it's all stuff we've seen before. the storytelling was done better in Dishonored and Horizon: Zero Dawn, the choice making was done better in the Mass Effect series and Fallout series, the combat was done better in Batman: Arkham City and Middle Earth: Shadow of War, and the crafting was done better in The Witcher 3, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild. Heck, even the sailing and ship to ship combat was done better in a previous installment of the series with AC 4: Black Flag.  Everything AC:Odyssey has to offer has been done better by other games that came out before it, and everything new it brings to the AC series is either poorly implemented, or kinda' meh. 
(What I really did like was the ability to scan an area with your eagle in order to locate points of interest, enemies, eliete enemies, and treasures in order to form a plan of attack. It was okay in Origins, and made better in Odyssey.)

But still! It's a fun game that as an AC fan I loved, and as a video game fan, I thought was solid, if not a bit unoriginal and unpolished.

For the poopy part of the review, I have to say that the microtransactions are a joke, they pull the same garbage that EA and mobile devs pull, and it's blatantly obvious. It's a purely single player game, Ubisoft, why are there in game transactions? They use these 'time savers' packs to get you to buy meager amounts of resources for not-so-meager amounts of money. It can save you six hours of grinding, but at the cost of $11.99. It's dumb, it's predatory, and the gaming community has made it clear that we hate it.

The microtransactions, the abysmal crafting/grinding system, the unpolished, lacking combat, the subpar graphics, and the unoriginality get this game a thumbs down from me. Wait a while until it's on sale, then have fun roaming the Greek world. It's not worth it at $60 right now.

0,388,24,3396,0,76561197980804400,0,english,False,45227640,"Odyssey = Origins in Ancient Greece + Black Flag sailing.  It seems fairly obvious that Ubisoft took the most popular features from past AC games and put them all into one, and it actually works pretty well.  It still has its flaws, of course, but 41 hours into the game, I'm still having a blast and there's still so much to do in the main story.  I would say that if you enjoyed Origins, you'll like Odyssey whether or not you played Black Flag.  If you liked Black Flag but did not like Origins, then I'd probably stay away from Odyssey, since the vast majority of Odyssey's gameplay is on land and is therefore nearly identical to Origins.

Since Odyssey borrows so much from Origins and Black Flag, I'm not going to go into detail about those game systems as they aren't new.  As for what IS new, well, the combat is different, you use a broken spear for assassinations instead of a hidden blade (it's actually more involved than that), and there's a cultist tracking/hunting system.

I find the combat to be harder than Origins, and not in a good way.  Most of that really boils down to enemies having too much health (or maybe it's just that there's no insta-kill abilities in combat:  I seriously miss counter kills from previous AC games).  Your abilities mostly require adrenaline to use and most have cooldown timers, which is lame, especially considering that some enemies appear to be able to spam their special attacks with reckless abandon.  My other major gripe with the combat is that enemies can attack at any time they wish while you're hitting them (apparently, they can work through the pain), but you can't do the same:  standard enemy attacks will always override your standard attacks (to be fair, though, your special attacks will always override an enemy's special attacks).  All of this put together makes combat feel kinda clunky, honestly.  It's not bad by any means, but it's not as good as it was in Origins, either.

The broken spear is your hidden blade substitute in Odyssey, and in terms of use, it functions pretty much identically to the hidden blade in Origins, with the notable exception that you can't assassinate while hanging underneath a target from a ledge.  On the flipside, because it's held like a dagger, if your character is wielding a one-handed weapon like a sword, he/she will use the spear in combat as an offhand weapon.  It looks cool, but has no function in combat.  The other big exception to the spear is that it can be upgraded, which affects your overall combat prowess.  It also serves as a gate for your skills:  most skills can't be upgraded to their final level until your spear is at level 5 (out of 6).  Spear upgrades are tied directly to the cultist system:  each cultist you kill has an item that you collect, and when you collect enough of those items, you can upgrade your spear.

Speaking of the cultist system, it has been completely redesigned from the one in Origins.  There are many more targets than in Origins, and the design of the cult tracking menu lets you see just how many cult members you have to kill from the moment you first see it.  Most cult members start off unknown:  you have to track down clues to identify them.  Once you identify them, you can ""unmask"" them in the cult tracking menu, and once they are unmasked, you can attempt to assassinate them.  Assassinating a cult member is a free-form thing:  it is usually not tied to a quest (though some are), which means that you're more or less free to go after cult members in whatever order you wish, assuming that your level is high enough to take on a particular cult member.  Just by playing the story, you will unmask a few cult members that will be much too difficult for you to handle until you level up (similar to Origins, small level gaps = big difficulty spikes, so it's best to wait to take on enemies until you're within only one or two levels of their level).  If you try to take on a cult member that is three or more levels higher than you, you'll get destroyed in a straight up fight.  You might be able to assassinate them stealthily, but it will involve multiple assassination attempts followed by panicked running/hiding when you see how little damage each assassination does.  Still, if you're patient (i.e. insane) enough to assassinate and run/hide from a single target 20 times, it's possible to get away with it.

Now, some of the bad stuff:
1. The game is grindy.  In order to keep up with enemy levels and not get shredded in combat, you have to do every single mission you can find.  Every.  Single.  One.  Naturally, for $10 real money (on top of the $60 you already paid for the game itself), Ubisoft is willing to sell you a permanent XP boost that smooths that leveling out and allows you to pick and choose which side quests are worth your time, which, ahem, isn't a shady, despicable business practice at all. /sarcasm
2. Upgrading your gear is too expensive.  I loved the concept of this system when it was introduced in Origins, but I don't remember it being this expensive.  The drachme (gold/in-game currency) costs are fine, but the resource costs to upgrade gear are pretty ridiculous, and only get more ridiculous the higher you go.  It's the same with your ship's upgrades, which just adds more grinding time to an already grindy single player game.  Or...you could pay some more real money for one of Ubisoft's resource packs, which, again, isn't a deplorable business tactic at all.
3. Restricted areas are sometimes too big and give insufficient warning that you are tresspassing.  You can be walking along a public street, minding your own business when suddenly, you see your compass background turn yellow or red and the guards attack because you were ""tresspassing"" at that building across the street.  It doesn't happen a lot, but often enough that it's annoying.
4. If there are witnesses to a fight, killing in self-defense counts as a murder towards the bounty system.  What's more, your ""crimes"" are reported immediately, and can even be reported by other people already involved in the fight.

1. Everytime you change any of the video settings, you need to restart the game. Even window to fullscreen. So I spent 20+ minutes trying to find the best settings for my computer. So by the time I started playing I was already pretty frustrated.

Playing a greek demigod person does not feel like an assassin at all for me.

The main issue with this game is progression. This game wants players to do the side content it offers, and the side content that is in the game is worth doing. There is only one problem though, I don't want to be forced to do side content everytime I complete a story mission. The game almost forces it's side content on you, a good example of this is when you need to retrieve an artifact from the Labyrinth so you can seal away a first civ temple. The game makes you help some people out around Crete and all of the ""support missions"" in this sequence are meant for level 30ish characters. The actual fight with the Minotaur is a level 40 Mission. So you did a whole bunch of work for more or less nothing because you have to grind out quests on the other side of the map, it butchers the narrative progression of the minotaur story arc for no other reason then ""muh side content"". Either lock the first civ arc off until the late/end game or lower the levels of the beast fights.

Other then the progression issues this game is really good.",True,1539299158,1539299158,True,0,0,0,False

We complain if it's too easy or too hard. We complain over micro tranactions we don't have to participate in. And we complain just because we can and like to. You get my drift.
This is an Assassin's Creed game. There is some grinding to be done here. If you don't like the series I suggest you don't buy it. If you like the series I doubt you will be disatisfied. Is it too big as some suggest. Aboslutely not. I like open world games with plenty to do. And if you do to, you will like this. It's similar to Origin's with some improvements. The graghics are stellar. The story line is good. The mechanics are good (could use minor improvemets, but still pretty good). 
My only complaint would be my build is starting to show its age a bit.
intel i7 6900k @ 4.1 ghz
2x Gtx 1080s in sli
32gb ddr4 @ 2667mhz
This was never the perfect gaming build and was never intended to be. But since this game has no sli profile I can't keep a steady 60 fps with everything maxed out at 1440p. But with a little tweaking I can hit 60 to 80 fps which is good enough and very playable. I've run into this in a few of the latest AAA games. It's just the way it is. I'd like an sli profile, but I can live without it. Odessey certainly dosen't have some of the performance issues Origins started with and were fixed along the way.
So my opinion is this: if you like the Assassin's Creed franchise, I doubt you will be unhappy with this. Certainly if you like Origins. And I like both. Don't participate in micro-transactions if you don't want too, I don't. Is it a perfect experience? No. I can only think of a very few games that are. But it's good and in my book worth the cash for the entertainment. I think Ubisoft did a fine job here.

There is a ton to do and explore but TO ME at least it doesn't seem tedious and useless. Your choices in situations DO have effects on the game (no spoilers but I found out a negative effect the hard way), but it makes you feel more involved and immersed in the world. Always fun finding new gear.  The game looks beautiful but it will stress your pc to the max (I'm guessing more due to poor optimization/drivers). I'm running it on 1080p 60hz refresh rate monitor, maximum settings for everything, not using supersampling though. 115% (i think thats the max) field of view. I have adaptive v sync to help with tearing and I haven't dropped below 52fps I think was the lowest I saw.  My hardware: i7 8700k @ 4.7ghz on all cores, 16gb 2400mhz ddr4 RAM, MSI Duke Gtx 1080ti, samsung 970 evo 500gb nvme ssd.  

A personal dislike though not major is that I don't truly feel like im playing an actual assassin anymore so much as just a warrior; though the stealth is satisfying and I do like that you cant just instant assassinate everyone, you actually need to be strong enough to do it.  

My biggest complaint is the microtransactions, THEY REALLYYYYYYY want you to buy them, and most of the stuff is on the pricey side.  There is a permanent account boost for +50% exp and gold in game, which you don't NEED but it does help level up a bit faster. I personally think they need to patch an increase in to aquiring gold because its a pain to build up unless you sell blue and higher tier gear BUT that takes away from getting the crafting materials you need a TON of, especially for your ship.  I don't mind having sections of the map tiered off based on your level, since I'm an MMO player and i think it helps you build more of a sense of gaining stregth and skill as you progress and not just mopping the floor with every enemy you encounter like you could in older AC games.

I haven't found the game to be really glitchy or anything, only crashed on me once but thankfully my save file was ok and I didn't really lose any progress.

You know why? Well, simply because, among many other things that I won't mention and let you discover for yourselves, the game has:

- awesome mechanics
- fascinating characters
- astonishing graphics
- breathtaking landscapes
- an intriguing story
- an unbelievably big map to explore

Honestly, this is the ultimate ""Creed"" compilation with everything we've ever wanted from the series, and more! At this point, I could care less about Altaïr, Ezio, Connor, Aveline, Kenway, Shay, Arno, the Frye twins, Bayek and the three characters from ""Chronicles"", and I've been a huge fan of them all since the original launch in 2007, but not anymore.
[b]Now there is only Alexios in ""Assassin's Creed: Odyssey""![/b]

In one single punch, assassin's creed odissey has given us so much content and creativity, that it competes not with one game, but at least four at the very same time: number one, FOR HONOR, yes what this other game has not been able to give us in terms of freedom of movement exploration etc., odissey brings us with ease, two, TOMB RAIDER, not all life is made of tomb raiding as such is the case with that game, but odissey has given us this peculiar mini series of tomb explorations that is just ADDICTIVE!, number three: SKULL AND BONES, i think this upcoming game developers may be SUPER AFRAID of releasing it because the open seas gameplay of odissey is simply beyond EPIC, i have not seen yet any other game with such magnicficent ocean simulation, the beauty of the vessels, the way they handle like in real life wooden boats (the physics engine involved.) Beware if you start to hit n ram on enemy ships because poseidons rage will rain upon you and the ocean will become a tormentous ordeal along with the fights, and to keep your adrenaline levels way up the scales, the superb background music will be right there backing it all up.

Number four: ASSASINS CREED itself! yes, if you are the kind of player that was in awe of a.c. up until the xbox 360 assassins creed 2, but never quite liked it afterwards, not even origins, then fear not cause this is a fresh start, a path that I URGE UBISOFT to reamin on and EXPAND UPON four times it sheer size over! you will have exploration for free, you will have tomb raiding and legendary equipment exploiting let alone solving the tomb puzzles, you will have endless epic ocean pirating, you will be granted the chance to deviate from being a boring assasing and face the enemhy head on, become a warrior or a devastating hunter, you will have a ton of mini quests that make you feel that you are really helping dudes around, you will take your NIKKON camera around and take those wonderful sunrises all over the place, hell yeah. you will hunt down legendary beasts in awesome settings, heck you dont wanna do nothing? this is the game for you! fly the got dam eagle at will! you will seek forgotten places that the BLIND KING will request upon you, or you will solve ancient language meanings as a totally separate taskt from it all. need I go on?

IN FIVE HOURS you will become a master of arms, i recomend large axe and bow all over, with little extra real money you will get a jumpstart into motion that is zero expense compared to games of the likes of GUILD WARS 2, my personal favourite as well. my level scaling has been efficient and balanced, im just as strong as my enemy perhaps a bit more in case i am outnumbered, a good challenge in normal mode. I am at level 36 now, but guess what? i dont want to go up fast yet, cause it is so fun to face those higher leveled enemies for one. makes you feel like you are fighting against some epic hercules or something, I have found the ocean sailing inmensely fun, it grabs you so deep into pirating ships that you can spend hours just there! oh, the grand ARENA, here comes UFC!!!!! 

bugs: yes some, some orichalcum ore areas dont work on a small island the ore is just floating in air, i cannot take it, took photo of it. on another area it is below a wooden bridge, cannot obtain it either. i had this odd experience that my health remained locked at 1/4th or my total for some reason, after several reload tries that did not work, my solution was to remove all my equipment and install it back again on my toon! so beware ok if that happens.
Also, the Adrestia Vessel tends to enter into turbo speed mode nonstop here and there even without the sails, D:

COMPLAINTS: only one, if we all learned not from history but from the movie 300 that leonidas rejected the help of the short fellaw who could not raise his SHIELD all because the shield was the most important aspect of the warfare style of the spartans, that the group works as a SINGLE IMPENETRABLE UNIT, that one soldier defends the soldier next to him, etc. etc., then where, I might ask, IS MY GOT DAM SHIELD? I waited along the whole story to somehow get it as the ULTIMATE loot or prize, but no, I am left alone with a spear! or an axe, or a dagger, or a sword, we must all raise our SHIELDS!!!!!!

UBISOFT, when i say stay the course here i mean BRING ME A LARGE PERSIAN INVASION in the future, A TURK invasion, or viceversa, take us further yet to explore and conquer, expand and open these maps, keep on bringing those quests. go deep into the stories that were never told, whatever pleases your imagination will do so long as it is set up in this kind of platform. For me to review a game is like a no go! So when I review one, it is only because i have been deeply impacted by it, ASSASSINs CREED ODISSEY is an admirable piece or art and work, worth receiving the highest of ranks!

This game is  awesome, it packs in so many activities that it can almost feel overwhelming on what to do next, but in a good way. I loved Origins, but this make origins look like an unfinished beta, it improves on every aspect. This is now a full RPG, unlike older AC titles, if open world questing and exploring are not your thing then dont play this. Tired of seeing all the reviews complaining about questing and grinding, if that's not your thing then move on and let the rest of enjoy this beautiful well done game. There is no ""grindwall"" Ive seen so many negative comments about being forced into MTs to buy a XP boost, that is not the case. Do not be fooled by these reviews or comments, if you play the whole game and quest and explore you will level up just fine. In fact I'm the opposite, I love to explore everything and do everything (see my Witcher 3 hours) and in doing so I have over leveled most of the areas before I could even get to them. Bottom line I am loving the game and have not bought any MTs as I have no reason to. The only reason i could see buying an XP boost is if you dont want to explore the game and only want the main story, if that's the case then why did you even buy this? Go play a telltale game if that's all you want. Now, on to the pros and cons that I have experienced so far:

Pros:
1. World
Beautiful open world with tons of activities to keep you busy, and the wold actually has different feels in different areas. origins was just hot sand everywhere and that got a bit boring near the end. This game has many different seasonal looks as you go through it which I love, and of course it has a great photo mode for taking pics.
2. Gear overhaul is awesome! 
I love exploring for loot and customizing my look and this game has tons of that, unlike origins that had you just picking cosmetic outfits and the only loot was weapons, Ody opens it all up. You can now loot all of your armor and upgrade it as you go. They removed the need for all the bows and instead put that effort into head, chest, arms, waist, and leg slots that totally change your look with each new piece. The detail on all the armor is top notch, I am continually amazed how great all the armor looks and all the attention to little details. Huge huge improvement over Origins. 
3. Side activities 
ACOd packs in the side content to keep you busy with other things so you can take a break from the main story any time to engage in them. You now have a mercenary side quest to move up the ranks of your fellow mercenaries, and the detail put into this is awesome, all of the mercenaries have strengths and weaknesses and full backstories that you can read before you engage them. You can hunt them down on your own or wait for them to come to you if you have a wanted level (similar to the GTA star system) You now have full control of a naval ship and upgrading its look, armor, weapons and crew. Ship battles are a little simpler than Black Flag, but are a ton of fun nonetheless. While your out taking down targets on land you can now analyze them and see if they are high level and would be an asset to your crew. Once recruited they will be on your ship and look the same as when you got them, they also help you fight in your ship battles. I was expecting them as Lieutenants on your ship to be an invisible entity that just contribute to your stats, but no they are very detailed in that they have names and unique looks that add to the prestige of your crew and you will spend a lot of time fighting along side them. 
There is also a full cult you get to track down with clues you find in the world to uncover their identities so you can find them and take them out, as you do they provide resources to upgrade your spear giving you many different benefits as you do. I wont go into too much detail on this as it can be spoilers for the story, but another well done system and side activity that I have been enjoying a lot.
3. Skills
I love the new skill overhaul and now it feel more like you actually get to play ""builds"" rather than just unlocking everything eventually. There are many ways to customize how you like to play with the skill builds and your gear. Love sneaking around and doing 1 shot assassinations? Then work on the assassin tree and build your gear toward assassin damage. At the beginning I couldn't one shot people, but now with a few re-specs I have no problem at all. Again this is an RPG, so you wont have all the best ability when you first start, you have to earn it as you go. This game has a great feel of progression and doesn't feel grindy at all. I'm always doing something fun when i'm getting my levels. Also if you choose wrong you can re-spec at anytime in the menu for a small fee.

Will update more later as I go

Cons:
1. Alexios animation and voice acting are not very good. Cassandra seems to have the better voice actor. Sometimes the animations dont match the actions or voice, but nothing game breaking.
2. Too much money and resources to upgrade your legendary items to a current level, the money is fine, but why would I give up 400 wood to upgrade a spear. You need those resources for your ship, I wish they would lower down the mat requirements for these. Again its not a game breaker as you do get a steady stream of new items, but it would be nice to upgrade them more without so much of a penalty.
3. needs more fast travel points. I love exploring but there are times I like to jump to an area and work on things and they only let you travel to sync points now and not all the cities like in Origins, I hope they change this eventually. In the end you will just be doing more walking and horse riding for now, but it forces me to collect my ship mats more often so its not all a bad thing. 
4. Bulletin board quests are a joke, some of them you will literally just hand someone some money for XP and to finish the quests. Ive seen fetch quests more interesting than this. However they are not required to advance, and the main quests and regular side quests make up for it. I just get these quest in case I happen to be near it. If so ill do it, otherwise I dont go out of my way.

Summary
I will update more as I go through the game....
Don't be fooled by troll reviews talking about grind walls and mandatory MT purchases, its all complete crap and lies. If you're into big open world RPGs like Witcher 3 then this is your jam, get it.

The last few Assassin's Creed games have been great in my opinion, but lacking. Odyssey has restored the series to its former glory and beyond in my opinion.

Pros:
- Exploration mode - Gives you more reason to explore and enjoy the world
- Choices that impact the story and relationships
- Combat - Not too easy, not too difficult.. just right
- Ship battles - Never was a fan of ship battles in Black Flag and other games, but I quite like how they work in Odyssey
- Unique Abilities - 4 melee and 4 archery abilities that can be assigned to use. One unlock per level, at least so far
- Amazing graphics - I run the game on ultra settings at 1080p on my 4k monitor, and even being stretched like that, the game is stunningly beautiful
I'm only 15% through the game, so I'm bound to find more things to list as a pro, and I only listed a few major pros here

Cons:
- It does tend to freeze from time to time, not often, and not game impacting (I run a gtx 1080 and i7 7700 with 32 gigs ram)
- Made the mistake of unlocking Evie (the UPlay reward) before I progressed far enough to get a ship in the game, now it seems she is lost forever, hopefully Ubisoft fixes this bug
- Resource heavy - Even with a beast of a computer, if I want to play with ultra settings, I can't play in 4k or 2k, unless I wanted to settle for less than 60fps

Voice acting, the sense of freedom, the script and quest structures are a major step up from Origin, BUT the leveling stuff is still very annoying to deal with as sometimes you are just stuck in an area where you just can't do anything but leave since none of the given approachs work if you are 2 or 3 levels behind, imo I hate this. Alot.

Playing on Hard mode + Exploration mode is highly recommended.

Microtransactions are there but I don't think they are forced upon the player or anything... maybe it's just I enjoy playing the game enough that the time-savers aren't relevant or appealing to me.

Not too shabby Ubisoft, maybe you will become a decent game publisher once again.

The good:
Intersting story with freedom of chose dialog should be keep forever on AC series, it is making the game play varied.
Side quests most of them were very intersting.
Stealth/Infiltration are fun to play because of improved A.I and more well builded enemies bases, many of tactics works too, like using arrows shot a place to lure enemy walk specified direction. or using dead body as a attraction, whistle works on vertical too.
Improved combat gives more style to play.
Huge, pretty and varied world to explore.
Great graphcis and music.

Cons:
Run quite bad on above average PC.
Stealth game play still not as deep as other stealth games.
Although there are many bases to Infiltrate some of them were using same struture design blueprint, i wish there are more realized enemies bases, for example big interior with wellplaced obstacles to hide.

Overall is great and best AC for me

STORY:
Haven't gotten to far into the story, just unlocked the cult system (which is quite cool looking). However the story is immersive and decent.
Sneaky Stabby and Stabby Stabby:
There's a lot of bitching about microtransactions (fuck off ubi), which I haven't hit any of the grindy parts. Playing on hard I have beaten mobs that were higher level than me (but still in the white), it was quite challenging and often took many tries, but it is possible. I honesty like the combat system it's the best part of the game, per the normal assassin's creed. Each weapon are different. I'm not going to into detail on each type of weapon feels, beacuse they feel exactly how you think they would feel. Stealth is not op, but still is good to do. Skills are also game changing, get some skills over others (bow is actually really good, don't forget about them).
THE MECHANICS THAT SUCK:
Overall I like the game quite a lot, however the travel system is pretty ass. Fast traveling is pretty annoying, for an example why can't I teleport to towns? The spotting mechanic is very annoying, the bird isn't fun to use. It takes a few seconds to go back in forth between them, which is the worst when trying to stealth. On top of that it feels inconsistent, either the bird can see through the universe or couldn't see its own closed eyelids. Worse of all, I don't get any infomation from using it. I don't use the bird to scout out ahead, or to be able to (INTERESTLY) track down my targets. I just go into bird mode, and just throw my mouse around until I mark everything. Also using the spotting mechanic for the boats, is pretty much entirely painful.
Boats+Factions+Mercs:
AC4 without the cannons, and being a pirate. Overall honestly I'd say the boating system in Odyssey is just nothing new, I don't feel like they really did anything intresting with it. You deal with actual fucking mythological creatures, is there really no intresting ideas that they had? I think it would be badass to build a fleet (like in AC4) but actually see your ships floating around perhaps joining you in fights, or allowing you to make an actual personal army or navy. This actually ties into my next problem for Odyssey, I don't feel much of an impact for helping a faction take a territory. I just helped you guys take over a territory, and you give me a shoe. Then on top of that, they don't care that I just helped their enemy attack them. Also the mercs are just a minor hinderance, as the march their death. They don't try to sneak up on me or do anything but walk right at me. Also at one point after killing about 10 of mercs in a row, you'd think that perhaps they wouldn't want to take this contract.

The plot and story are tenfold better than Origins, even if they're strikingly similar - a family focused story and you oppose a mysterious organisation that are trying to kill you and you're family.

the ship gameplay is super lackluster and downright infuriating, despite Black Flag coming out 5 years ago Ubisoft has not been capable of getting it right since (expect the super short Rouge which is just a Black Flag expansion). Unlike Black Flag where your ship progressed powerfully alongside your character in this game its secondary, so you have no incentive to put any upgrades into it. And you would be an idiot to do so, every level you gain is way too significant a jump in damage and health and if you have no materials to upgrade your legendary weapons as you level you'll be at a massive disadvantage.

Because you put no active effort into your ship and a single level means a significant jump in difficutly it becomes unfair very, very quickly. You're ship will be ganked by groups of 3 or more pirates at every turn of the ocean and you will die very fast.

But all in all the ship gameplay is a very miniscule part of Odyssey and isn't what annoys me the most. The actual story grinds to a total halt once you reach level 13 for a short time. Then it REALLY grinds to a halt in the early 20's.

Their aren't enough story missions to get you to a high enough level to continue the story, once you finish a mission you'll find yourself grinding 3-4 levels to reach the new zone or start the next mission. It's the most insane thing I've ever witnessed in an Assassins Creed game before in its history.

[h1]Immersion & Questing[/h1]

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is taking us through a war-torn Greece as a misthios, a man-for-hire, who is searching for answers (cue family drama) and adventures. Through multiple story arcs, each more interesting than the other is added a spectacular amount of side quests that are intricated somehow in the decisions you made.

Indeed, Odyssey emphasized dialogues and choices. Some of them can have a drastic impact on the story, others quest and how people react around you. Based on your previous decisions, NPCs are going to be referencing your previous actions and can potentially cut some quests from your storylines.

The results of this are two folds: with so many different endings and choices, there is a replayability value rarely seen in an Assassin’s Creed game and it all manages to intricate your actions into the different story arcs and create an incredibly immersive universe based around your vision of your character.

Overall, Odyssey is extremely rich in content. The integration of the side quests within the main story makes it so that you will want to do more of them! We calculated that a good 60 to 70 hours can be put in the game without finishing it. You will still have plenty of work to do.

[h1]Graphics & Exploration[/h1]

We played the game on Nightmare difficulty with exploration mode, the latter is a nice touch by Ubisoft because you must search for the objectives and use the skill set Ikaros, your eagle possesses to locate them and not just mindlessly go after them. These two elements together made it so that some fights and activities had to be planned in order not to die a stupid death.

Exploring the game in this beautiful reconstruction of ancient Greece unlocks little excerpts of the history behind buildings, characters and other historical elements in this country that breathe and bleeds history. A real plus for any history nerds.

Let’s also mention the fact that there are no loading times between the different maps, sea, mountains or anything at all. It’s a feat considering the graphics and the fact that Greece is exceptionally vast in this game.

Indeed, through exploration, you can easily witness how everything is wonderfully tied up together. Graphically, the game is terrific, with spectacular scenery and a great photo mode, mechanics are fluid, it is the kind of technical prowess that we would expect from Ubisoft.

The scenery is just utterly gorgeous from the open sea to the beautiful forests, islands, cities and their decorations, Odyssey is a treat for the eye. Animations are superb, you can easily sense how everyone feels about whatever they are saying and how they are feeling.

[h1]Gameplay & Combat[/h1]

The game is dependent to your level, you can’t just wander (you can) into a zone and expect to be just fine. A few level differences mean death most of the time. Leveling is fair, it will get slower the higher your level is, but I never felt like I had to grind for levels or anything. It all happened as I was playing.

Drawing inspirations from quite a few RPGs, the skill tree is built around your game style. You have the freedom to develop it the way you want to through three main choices: Hunter (ranged), Warrior (melee) and Assassin (stealth). You can most probably mix ‘em up as I did with a Warrior-Assassin build.

Your equipment needs to be carefully thought out and the same goes out for the bonus you are engraving within your weapons and armors. Also, fashion hunters: five pieces of equipment are going to change your in-game appearance.

Fighting in this game revolves around dodging and counter-attacking with light and heavy attacks (at least in nightmare difficulty). Mechanics are fluid, fights are challenging, but the biggest down part is that you are limited to 4 active skills from the three treelines available. This is extremely limiting, and I stopped counting the times I had to press start mid-fight to change the bounded skills to something that could be useful in this specific fight and adapt the strategy Alexios (or Kassandra) was doing to sometimes, survive. This specific issue was for me game-breaking, immersion-breaking and plain annoying.

Odyssey gives the player a vast array of choices as of which weapons they are going to use, axes, bows, daggers, maces, staves, spears and swords all have their pros and cons and are just different enough to be meaningful and give a different in-game experience.

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is also bringing back naval fights and navigation from the depths of Black flag and Rogue. While not a lot of things changed besides making your ship upgradeable, is the fact that you can now have lieutenants on your ship that gives a passive bonus. While it is not innovative, it is the best Naval fights we’ve ever seen in an Assassin’s Creed.

Finally, a system of mercenaries very similar to what we can find in Shadow of War is proposed, based on the illegal actions you do throughout the game, your bounty will raise, said mercenaries will then hunt for you and try to kill you. Killing them instead, induce a fun leaderboard of mercenaries, that you can climb for rewards. This is entirely optional, you can ignore this and while it is just a plus to the game, it adds a great atmosphere around it, with more immersion and some more challenging fights.

There is also an entire pan of gameplay revolving around conquering a region. Just like Shadow of War once again, you will need to conquer or defend a plot of land for either Sparta or Athens by killing local leaders, pillaging and lowering the enemy presence in the area.

[h1]Very few bugs[/h1]

While everything in the game seems to be working flawlessly, the lock-on system can give you some trouble maneuvering the camera when fighting enemies in a small space. Finally, the game didn’t have a game breaking bug once during my run and for such a game it is quite incredible. Odyssey suffers from a lot of collision issues though.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Odyssey’s world is by far the biggest, most gorgeous and with the most content of the franchise. It feels like Ubisoft took what was best in recent gaming, made it their own and delivered the best Assassin’s Creed of the franchise history. With marvelous environment, scenery, gameplay and spotless mechanics, Odyssey sets an entirely new level for Assassin’s Creed and is probably one of the best RPG we got since the Witcher III.",True,1539233162,1539233162,True,6,44,0.689217329025268555,False
0,116,6,2278,0,76561198075437124,0,english,False,45213141,"This game is BEAUTIFUL. The world, the character models (I love Greek period being a Rome Total War fan myself), the environment, the lighting and shadows, small details in animation, the crew singing on the boat. Acting is great. Combat animations and executions look fluid. 

But it's just a very pretty thing masking a very shallow, repetitive, and grindey game.

In short, this is why this game is shallow:
1. You have MAPHACK with the bird. Tracks everyone without an expiration timer. There's nothing in the story that explains why the bird gives you telepathy. Makes sneak playstyle TOO EASY

2. Enemies can be cheesed. NO ONE can catch you if you climb shit and GTFO. Literally 15 seconds later they'll forget about you, then you can go use your maphack to pick them off again

3. Combat is boring and RPG-like. It's all in parry timing and dodge timing, but not fun like Dark Souls because enemies are hit sponges. Strong attacks always result in you getting hit, so it's just button mashing the light attack. You have these abilities like in an MMORPG game like ""spartan kick"" or this weird dash thing 

4. The pacing is like that latest game of thrones season. The next destination can be reached in 20 seconds top by horse. Major plot developments occur in 5 minutes. If you've played GTA, that's an example of good story+story pacing. 

5. A little grindey - if you're under-leveled, you'll do like 2% damage per hit to enemies 2-3 levels higher than you. 

This game is good for relaxing after a long day of work or school. Hop on, do the next quest, admire the beautiful atmosphere. But don't expect anything challenging and fun like Dark Souls, and don't expect the story immersiveness of Witcher. VERY good game acting though.

Game feels like it's designed for Call of Duty players looking for a Dark Souls + Witcher experience that's extremely convenient - I stress the word convenient. If you accidentally fall off a high cliff, you're left with 1 hp.

First things first, all these people out here complaining about the microtransactions, pointless, they grant no help what so ever. The tool to help you spot all the treasures on the map? Did someone forget about google? Other things are just cosmetics or a slight help to progress you along, which is practically useless, since the gear and resources you can get within 1 - 2 hours of grinding. So in conclusion, microtranactions? Useless unless you are a rich spoiled brat or just want to support ubi. Also just a fyi it's a single player game, so if another player buys something off the shop, it WON'T affect you in any way. This is also a RPG game so it is excepted to have these microtransactions.

Alright so we have gotten microtransactions out of the way, let's talk about the core gameplay of AC: ODYSSEY. Storyline? 9/10. It is extremely interesting, will leave players hungry for more, yes somethings you will need to grind and beat hard bosses, but you just need to learn the combat system. Now combat system, 10/10. Best AC combat I have ever experienced, yes there are a few glitches, but I have only ever had 2 or 3 during my time in combat. Gear system? OH MAN DO I LOVE IT, 11/10. Of course that is only if you are into RPG games like me, I love the grind and the leveling of gears. If you want to know how to get legendary, just look at your quests, merks, and cultists, or just google it, your call. Boat fighting mechanic, eh 8/10. Not the best, at least compaired to Black Flag. Don't get me wrong here, but the boat combat on the water is extremely fun, it's just the boarding part that needs work. Sometimes my crew won't come with me because their scared and I have to face 20 guys alone. Also you can't really do any damage to the enemy crew before boarding since there is no cannons, but of course this is 431 B.C. Now the assassinations, ohhh weeee, 100/10. I have never been so hyped about killing someone, the spear stuck in one end of the enemy and pulls it out on the other end. Damn is that satisfying. Last but not least, the abilities. The ability tree is very well thought and out executed. I love it, it's really balanced, except for when you find a ability combo that is overpowered as hell. Also you can't spam the abilities, there is a stamina system, 9/10. The game is difficult and requires more brain power then other AC games, so just be prepared to use the big brains.

Only downsides to this game is the amount of glitches, there is quite a few, but most are small and unnoticable. Also the optimization, people have been screaming OH MY GAWD, 50 fps? UNPLAYABLE. I personally don't mind it, but of course it would be nice if they did something about it. I'm running a gtx 1050 ti and a ryzen 1200 O.C. to 3700 MHz and 16 Gb of DDR4 2667 MHz ram, and am getting about 30-55 fps on low-med. I find it totally playable, but if ubi can do something about it, and allow me to play a 60 fps, that would be pretty neat. Also the game can be a bit pricy.

I would rate this game a overall 9.5 out of 10. Extraordinary game, with a few small bugs, but overall enjoyable. Will provide over a solid 50 hour of story, and can go all the way up to 300 hours of gameplay, and that is without all the DLC.",True,1539231168,1539231168,True,0,1,0,False

Pros: 
-- The gameplay is really good and the combat can feel amazing. I saw myself complaining about being outmatched and the fact that I couldn't win the fight, but that was my ignorance making me think that I was invincible.
-- The visuals are amazing and leave me with many beautiful screenshots of the game. While I do have a great PC setup, I feel that if someone doesn't have the minimum requirements, then they'll have a tough time playing the game.
-- The different weapons allow for some cool animations and different playstyles. 
-- The animations look great when they line up with the person your killing

Cons: 
-- The game is BUGGY. I experienced about 4 hard freezes and quest just not showing up. When the game works, it's fun as hell, but when the game keeps freezing, it gets hard to enjoy.
-- The DAMN MICRO-TRANSACTION system. I hate how you have to grind so much just to level up your gear. The upgrade system would be better if you didn't have the micro-transactions being shoved at you constantly. Some may say that you can just go and do different things to get the materials, but when it gives you 3 to 5 iron when you need about 80 to upgrade one piece of gear, it gets annoying and you'll fall far behind on armor or weapon damage causing you to die easily or spam the attack buttons on 1 guy for 2 minutes.

Time sink. Health Bars. Gating areas. Not so open world now. Why didnt they just go with Zelda: BOTW and have weapons that get destroyed with time and no ""levels"". Like they saw the Witcher series and decided to make the combat so simple to bore you. A gold portait 1 level higher than you will take almost 100 hits with non max(your level) weapons, and over 2 critical hit assassinations. Yes that means stab... then run away... hide... come back... and hope he dies this time. Asinine creed more like it.  Enough ranting. I will be refunding. 1st game I have ever refunded. Not worth 60 dollars, especially when there is a pay wall of time reduction which up until this point was fine, but now its salt on the wounds. So disappointed, bring back black flag and get rid of the ""levels"" and I may try again, highly doubt it. I will never buy a day one purchase from Ubisoft again.


Edit 2: So steam would not let me refund this after 12 hours play time. In my defense I cant judge a game at only 2 hours, especially a disappointment as big as this one.

The story has actually been really good up to the point i am at.

Sure, it's very similar to Origins on the surface, but once you get into it, it's a much more personal game, giving you the ability to make your own decisions (to an extent), but we'll see how much those actually impact the game later on ;)

I spent two-three hours alone on the first island exploring the beauty of it, and simply adjusting to the combat.  The fact that you can have special abilities is completely new to this series (as is a lot of other things).  I see what people mean: this is very similar to an RPG.

The world is massive, and it feels limitless!  It's amazing.  Not to mention they took the ship mechanic of Black Flag and added it here, but it feels more realstic, ESPECIALLY when you board a ship.  Instead of having the little cutscene in Black Flag, it sinks immidiately after you kill everyone, and you have just enough time to loot and then get back to the ship before it sinks under your feet.  It's honestly awesome.

You will need to watch out for your level... similarly to the last game, the bounty hunters are back, and they're as strong as ever, except they're a lot cooler with special attributes (from what I've seen).   I couldn't think about taking on the first hunter until I was level 4, and even then I was still nearly beaten.   The level recomndations were real in Origins, but here they're even truer to their word.

I cannot defeat enemies of the same level (boss enemies like Mercenaries and a certain boar fight). Combat is long enough to become dull as you hack at the same enemy until you cheese it to death or you kill it by dodging and scratching them.

The ""choice"" for the story portion is very superficial (at least so far), I chose to spare the life of a main character but after that choice, every dialog or cutscene suggested I killed him, which was odd to be sure, I don´t know if this will come up again later, but left me very unimpressed.

All in all, the grindy nature of this game is by far the worst thing, I also believe that this game could have benefited if it had been its own thing and not part of the AC universe, its starting to get stale even for me.

I put this into the fun and addictive game category.  The only other AC game I have played is Black Flag which was really well done.   If you are on the fence about this game and looking for something to push you onto one side of the fence or the other, allow me to put some things into perspective. 

1)  Reliability and stability - excellent.  If you are having CTDs, update your drivers and check your rig.  Stop complaining about a 20 year old computer issue that most people know how to fix in most cases.  I have had ZERO CTDs.
2) Graphics - turn it up to the max your rig can handle.  It is beautiful.  Enjoy what you paid for.
3) Combat - some AC and Shadow of War hybrid.  I like it, you may not.  Fighting multiple enemies at the same time can be rough at times, but use terrain to your advantage.  The Skill tree is fun to mess around with in terms of what type of fighter you want to be.
4) Characters - well done.  I chose to play as Kassandra and she is fun to play.  Her mannerisms and quirks are believeable and immerse you into her world.   I didnt play as Alex so I cant speak for his character.  The NPCs are mostly well done and have very good voice acting.
5) Scope - if you have time to burn then you just got yourself a great way to burn it.   The game is huge both in map size but also in the number of things you can do.   Travel can be tedious at times (as some have mentioned) but once you get used to it, its not that big a deal.  People that can't handle the travel time in this game sure didnt experience Everquest travel back in the day.  Enjoy the ride and the landscape.

I really enjoy the game but I'm nowhere near done.  I like games that give you a lot to do and make you commit time to doing it.  It makes it all worthwhile, especially when it looks as good as this game does.

The graphics are beautiful and AC Odyssey takes what AC Origins did and made it better ... sometimes. AC Origins was one of my favourite AC's, despite it's story being a bit boring, and at times, failing to grab my attention. But this is about AC Odyssey, so I'll stick to that. Odyssey's story doesn't fail to entertain me, and I often find myself focusing on that more than side quests. The Naval combat is exactly as it was in Origins with only a few additions including boarding. But I find myself trying to avoid naval combat more times than not. I also really liked this new cult tree that was added. Trying to gather clues to unveil a cult members identity so you can assassinate them and claim Legendary gear is rather interesting and intriguing as each cult member has their own back story. Making your kill more meaningful. My biggest drawbacks with this game are few but they are enough to give me an ulcer at the age of 23.

1. You play as either Alexios or his sister Kassandra ( I chose Alexios due to the fact that you are a Spartan warrior so it makes more sense historically ) , both are Spartans trained in the arts of war ... but wait a minute! Where the FUCK is my SHIELD!?!?!?!?!?!? If you're a history buff like me, you'll know that a shield was one of the most IMPORTANT things a Spartan warrior holds close them. That Spartan saying where the mother and or wife said to their son/ husband, ""Come back with this or on this"" does NOT apply to Alexios or Kassandra apparently because YOU GET NO FUCKING SHIELD!!!! 
Instead, you get a Bow and some arrows that completely mess with the whole Hellenistic look of your armour, not to mention the historical inaccuracy of a Spartan fighting with a bow. SPARTANS DID NOT FIGHT WITH BOWS, DAMMIT!!! It was seen as a cowards weapon. ""Oh, but Ragnar's Revenge, you play as a mercenary in Odyssey!""
Shut your filthy face!!! It was apart of Spartan ethos and apart of their whole culture. Why couldn't they just make a mechanic where a shield could also be used as a ranged weapon? Bayek got a shield. Why can't a damn Spartan get one? ""Oh no Alexios, you can't fight in the phalanx. You've got NO FUCKING SHIELD!!!"" Might as well shove my spear up someone's ass and call it quits.

2. Your helmet does NOT show in the cutscense. Why? Origins had it. And in a game where Korinthian helmets are availble, you're telling me ( or I guess I'm telling you ) that I can't check out my helmet up close in a cutscene? Bastards.

First off the fire damage is way to strong an enemy that is 2-3 levels lower than the player should not one shot them with a fire arrow. Also the fire should be put out when you jump in water or roll becasue the arrow does not drench you in oil so therefore it would be easy to put out. Second the Mercenaries need to be nerfed hardcore. There is no need to have them come in during main questline quests, they shouldn't be able to spawn out of thin air, when hiding they shouldn't be allowed to walk right to the bush you are in, they also shouldn't get to gang up on you 5v1. I was in the cave looking for Lagos and once I completed the quest two mercenaries just spawn at the end of the cave with me? if you have a level two wanted level and you kill two mercenaries you shouldn't get another wanted level you should lose the level you had because you killed the two that where looking for you. If these small quality of life changes where made then I could give this game a 5 out of 5 star rating. Another thing to add is the unrealistic swinging of heavy weapons by the enemy. I don't what hulk of a human is building these guys but I know for a fact that you can not swing a giant mace, axe, or hammer around like it is a plastic baseball bat.

[h1] TLDR: [/h1]
     Overall I think this game is well worth $60 and I will probably buy the season pass as well. The story is well written, the side quests are better than you’d expect and keep you just as engaged as the main quests. The plot twists are hard to guess and I was genuinely surprised by most of them. The sound is great, the combat is fluid, the RPG aspects are a great addition, the game is lots of fun. Like a better more polished version of origins. 

[h1] Details: [/h1]
     I think this game is excellent, it took me a few minutes short of 60 hours to complete the story line, this includes the main game (chapters 1-9), ridding the Greek world of cultists, and helping save the world from this guy under and island yelling about knowledge and fish. I would guess that at this point there are about 30-50 real side quests I have not done I expect there are 200 or so question marks I have not discovered but I have unveiled the entire map. I think that if you play on hard difficulty (I played on normal almost the whole time) than it will take 10+ hours extra as this game can be rather challenging. If I had to guess how long it would take to do the rest of the real side quests (Not the infinite number of randomly made ones but the real ones with voice acting and dialog) I would say probably 10-15 more hours. I give the story and side quests 10 out of 10.

[h1] Sound: [/h1]
     I played with Kassandra, so I can't speak for the voice acting of the other protagonist. However, all the characters in this game sound great, they have deep emotion and I find it easy to be immersed in the world they built for us to enjoy. The other thing that took my breath away when I first heard it was the thunder cracking while you’re at sea. Overall, I give the sound, music, and NPC voice acting 9.9 out of 10. 

[h1] Bugs: [/h1] 
     During the 60 hours I experienced 4 crashes, thanks to the auto-saves however I never lost any progress. (It should be noted I played most of this time within 5 days of the games release, so a few bugs can be expected) Another time I jumped off a building and got stuck perpetually falling inside a gap between to boulders. Though the game just murdered me, and it set me back about 10 seconds before the jump, so all was well. The last bug I experienced was while on the ship everyone on the upper deck disappeared, you could still hear them and move the ship as per normal, but I couldn’t use any combat abilities or fight whatsoever (quitting back to titles screen fixed this and it never happened again) Overall, performance of the game 9.7 out of 10.

[h1] Combat, Movement, and Climbing: [/h1] 
     Like origins, you can climb everything – sheer walls, horizontal cliff faces, statues, everything and it works well. A few times Kassandra didn’t seem interested in traversing specific spots but this never caused any game issues, just took an extra second of moving around. The movement in this game is quick, running around in this game is very enjoyable and it seems the it is perfectly suited for exploring, it never takes super long to get anywhere but you aren’t going so fast you miss everything as you sprint past it. Combat is very enjoyable, even at 60 hours I feel like there is room for me to improve and get better as well as experience the many different weapon types. (Spears and Swords are my favorite so far) Overall 10/10.

+ The world is massive and a real treat to look at. It's fun seeing historical figures as always and just seeing Ubisoft's recreation of things like the Parthenon are enjoyable if you're a history buff.
+The main story is pretty decent, there's some twists here and there and there's a handful of solid performances. 
+Combat feels fun, but bullet sponge enemies do drag it down a lot. 
+Adding dialogue choices was a great decision and there are a few brilliant moments here and there. I love small touches like having NPCs mention whether or not you were caught during a quest or who you may have killed.

-The world is very very empty. And because of a lack of fast travel you'll spend quite a lot of time doing nothing but staring at tons of trees while on horseback.
-Some of the voice acting and dialogue is terrible. Most of it is servicable to good, but occasionally you'll get someone who just completely takes you out of the game with an annoying voice or bizzare line. The child voice actors suck as to be expected, games should stop having them.
-Far far too much padding. I get the idea of wanting your adventure to be a true ""odyssey"" in scale, but leveling takes too long with too many shitty abilities in trees. Although I'd say the complaints of the game being grindy are mostly overstated, I do think that the game really doesn't want you to rush through it, Ubisoft wants you to explore the world this game around, and that may be a big deterrent for people interested in the story only.

They're trying to make a more RPG style game which I'm totally on board with but they've made a lot of bad choices.  The talent system is weirdly dependant on how far through the story youve progressed which results in you not being able to level skills or abilities to match your playstyle.  The map is similarly gated which is a necessary evil but it's wayyy too extreme.  Naval battles are pretty similar to Origins with the addtion of some meh crew mechanics.  I'm 20 hours deep and I've been forced to waste several points on skills I don't need and don't use.

The animations for this game are...strange.  The female character is weirdly masculine because I'm pretty sure they've just reused the skeleton and animations from the male lead, facial animations are the usual disaster.  Fighting and freerunning both feel slower and less fluid, it's awkward and there are a lot of mistakes.  There are lots of terrain bugs and stuff you should be able to climb but for some reason can't.  When sailing it's pretty easy to get stuck on the coast or have trouble turning around in the harbor.  I haven't gotten trapped in any geometry but I've been killed several times because I leapt into a corner and then just hung there which is a staple of AC games but it's happening way too much in this one.

The story and dialog so far are a mixed bag.  I'm not far enough in to really judge but the game hasn't made it very clear when you're making a big decision and when it's just flavor.  The main characters so far are kind of meh and the voice acting is ok.  I'm playing as Kassandra and so far she seems really shallow and I don't see much changing.  She's also crazy aggressive with the ladies and ultra cringey.  So far the absolute worst part of the game is the writing.

I'm not sure I'm sold on the gameplay loop which is funny because it's not very complicated.  There's tons of busy work to do but it's not very interesting.  Mercinaries is a bastard mix of the Phylakes and the Nemisis system and is so far completely useless.

Of course the game looks great.  Running on Ultra it peforms better than Origins did on the same build and I'd say looks just a bit better.  i7-7700k and 1080 both water cooled and I maintain a rock solid 60fps @2k.  I get occasional tearing and I have also noticed several options resetting themselves.

Overall I like the ideas and RPG elements they're trying to work into the game but I wish they'd taken a year off and really thought about what they were doing and why instead of just cramming a bunch of stuff together and calling it a game.  The gameplay is half baked and considering how technically similar it is to Origins the amount of things that they got wrong or got worse at is pretty amazing.



I'm sure they'll take care of some of my complaints with patches but unless you're a big AC fan wait for the Winter Sale.  I was bored and had the cash but I'll probably get about 25% through this and then drop it for a month or two while they fix all the bugs.",True,1539208388,1539223784,False,0,5,0.557046949863433838,False

The fact of the matter is that if there is a staggering amount of DLC within the first week of release, the game has cut content being placed behind a paywall. This is not excusable.

Gameplay is fine, you quickly get used to the controls in my opinion.

The concept of ""Leveled Areas"" is stupid if all areas level with the player. Why have leveled areas to begin with then?

The game is NOT historically accurate, so bear that in mind if you are one of those people who points out historical stuff constantly. Consider it an alternate reality, especially since your fighting Medusa and there are digital gods.

Graphically, the game fine enough. I am playing on Ultra settings and I have seen clipping issues with my armor, specifcally some vambraces and texture quality of npc armor looks like it was made out of butter.

    who are well versed with Assassin's titles may feel that the game is quite much like its 
    previous title ""Origins"", but by the time you reach Level 4/5, this would change. Its a 
    massive improvement over origins in many ways like gameplay, abilities, weapons & 
    armors

4. Choices you make do affect things later in the game, so it is always exciting to see how 
    things unfold as you move on in the story

5. Captivating Naval Battles. Improvements in terms of cosmetic nature & gameplay keep you 
    hooked up. Naval missions are available to keep you up & going to experience the life in 
    the sea. Beautiful water textures / whale splashes / dolphin school chasing boats / flock of 
    birds flying from island to island in open waters add a good amount of immersiveness to 
    the sea life

6. Mercenary System - One of major overhals & my favourite part of the game. If you commit 
    crime in a particular hold, someone from the hold raises a bounty on your head & a 
    mercenary hunts you down for that bounty. It is not the same thing as ""Phylakitai"" from 
    Origins who were spread across the map in regions. These mercenaries travel places in 
    your search. You can either pay off your bounty or kill the person who has put bounty on 
    your head to get rid of mercenaries chasing you. Killing mercenaries also takes you higher 
    in the Mercenary Ranking Order, until you become the most feared mercenary of ancient 
    Greece

7. Daughters of Artemis - A side ission that allows you to comeface to face with 8 of Greece's 
    Legendary Animals, namely - Nemean Lion, Kalydonian Boar, Hind of Keryneia, 
    Erymanthian Boar, Kallisto the Bear, Kretan Bull, Krokottas Hyena & Lykaon Wolf. Time 
    investing quests, but really fruitful ones. Good gears as rewards for completing each 
    animal quest. 
    After some time, you can also unlock the ability to tame an animal as your companion 
    along with ""Ikaros"" the eagle (your assassination companion). This does not have anything 
    to do with Daughters of Artemis questline though

8. Massive Map - I think they have made a playable map of the actual map of Greece. Its 
    really massive. After playing for more than 80 hrs, I think I have just explored 10 - 15% of 
    the map only. So, if you keep on picking side quests quite frequently, this game would give 
    you a lot of playable hours.

9. Hold Battles - You can pick a side (Sparta or Athens) & jump into a full scale battle 
    between the 2 sides for command over a hold / island & help a particular side to win this 
    war

10. Replayability - Once you complete the game with a character (Alexios / Cassandra) you 
      might like to play it again with the second character to see the story from his/her eyes 



B. Cons - 

1. The game is quite new & is not giving a very smooth playing experience as of yet.

2. Somehow, the ""Fullscreen"" option does not give me a fullscreen view. Not sure why. 
    Actually, no option does. I have tried a lot of settings & fixes that I got from internet + 
    Ubisoft's customer support, but none of them have been able to get a borderless full 
    screen view. I always get a windowed view

3. Very frequent frame rate drops (below 30 FPS). This makes it hard to aim with bows, 
    specially animals (who jump, run & change directions quite fast). I have tried fixing frame 
    rates to 60 / 90, but they keep on dropping, even when my rig is more than capable to 
    handle the heat of the game. This happens in Medium / High settings as well, for me. I 
    have NVIDIA Game Card & playing the game through NVIDIA Game Ready Driver 
    Interface seems to help stabilizing the frame rate a bit, but not much

4. Hopefully a stabilizaion & fullscreen patch is released soon. Witing for it, but maybe by teh 
    time it comes, I would've completed the game.

Overall, the game seems to be 8.5 / 10 for me at the moment. This would've been 9+ had I not been experiencing few performance issues here & there. I highly recommend this game. Very well made & made with a fantastic storyline. A round of applause for the developers for merging age old stories & science fiction in such a wonderful manner - your hardwork can be seen in the game very clearly.

Things that made me give this a thumbs down:
1) Microtransactions
2) Enemy scales with you, I mean, this can be good in some cases but jesus I don't want to fight a random wolf every single time and have to hit him 12 times regardless of level. This may change I'm around level 15ish.
3) Weapons, meh, they scale as you go, always find something better, once you have an epic or two they are just for parts. That's fine but not exciting to find treasures after a time.

Honestly, i just play things on easy nowadays to get through the story and move on to newer games but in this case it seems to have been a good call in general as it just lessens the grind in every way (if you upgraded your eqiupment to current level to keep them within a level of your own, you would spend so much time just searching for resources to upgrade with its ridiculous). Another tip: sell equipment, don't dismantle. the money is only ok, but you can use that money to clean out merchants of the resources they sell, which is arguably easier and more efficient. Other than that, have fun and enjoy the view, as this is a beautiful game with a great story that has very meaningful choices. google ""The Blood Fever"" quest choices to see what i mean by meaningful (only side quest spoilers). Even on easy i had to do the majority of the sidequests to keep up with the suggested level of the main story missions, and am now at a point where i need to go back and do the rest of them to move on even further.

My thoughts on the game
The game could be better and should be but for what it is its great. Not the game of the year in my opinion 

Pros 
Massive world
Great story
Cool weapons and cosmetics
Lots of gameplay so don't expect to finish this in a few days.
Amazing graphics but I do have a pretty good Pc tower
Love the ships and battle options when doing naval battle.

Cons
There is some obvious bugs and glitches so it does take away the experience
There seems to be some optimization problems as well
I think they released this game to soon because overall it could be a lot better. 
This game doesn't feel like a assassins creed game because it feels to me personally like a medieval open world game so a bit disappointed . Yes there is some things you're able to do like in most assassins creed games but the game just doesnt feel like a stealthy assassins but that might just be me. 

Overall. If you have spare money laying around and you're a sucker for games that last for awhile and love big open worlds and interesting storys this game is for you. 
If you dont have spare money but like games like this I would wait till the price goes down. 
I would give this game a 7 out of 10 . 10 being the best and 1 being the worst
Yes it could be better and should be especially for a well known developer company , the choice is up to you after all it's your money.",True,1539181725,1539537414,True,0,0,0,False

Story is okey it get better later on i have not finished it since im mainly grinding the side quest which later on become a requirment to gain levels. To make it worst side quest are not interesting as they are your basic kill this come back, most converstation are the same as well, and you need to do them if you want to advance which means they are no longer side quest as you dont have much choice in skipping them later if you want to go up. They added a booster that increases the exp and resources you get if you pay around £16 i would usualy not mind this if it was already pretty easy to grind then getting this would basicly eliminate the grind for people that have less time but even if you spend 8h a day next day you go right back to the grind as it never ends prices for upgrading gear are insanly high so you cant upgrade piece of gear you like often only every few levels and thats only some gear as you have quite few slots for gear now which is good too as it means you can mix your gear to create your own look but good luck upgrading that gear with the resource prices for each upgrade. you better off just using the next higher level gear then sticking with it till max level and just upgrade your ship till then. 

The game looks incredible, i mean from the moment you start with a giant zeus statue to later on massive temples and other statues you never seem to run out of things to look at and admire. you really feel imersed in the world, and you can even make your own choices in the game, sure not all have much meaning or any but some do and this add some replayability. One sad thing is we dont have a shield and with spartans in the game who are know for their shields thanks to 300 movie you kinda feel sad not having one they could of made it kinda like god of war gameplay with it where it was mostly used to couter enemy attacks rather then full on block as enemies could move your shield away, someone said it was done so because your a mercenery and merceneries dont use shields yet you keep getting attack by merceneries with shields so not sure whats going on there. 

Ship battles are fun they might not feel as good as we had it in black flag but thats propebly because cannons sound better then arrows or javalins how ever its mostly the same with eneies maybe being more agressive and trying to ram you almost all the time while also shooting you making sea combat quite a chalange.

What makes me like this game is that you can just hit f5 to quick save close the game and continue on at any time so if you burn your self out from the grind you can just go play another game till you start to miss the feel of rome and want more action which usualy means back to the grind but even that can be fun at times, instead of using stealth to take over a garrison of 15+ units you go full on causing massive battle which can get quite hard if your undergeared and not carefull, this game its not as easy as other AC games where you just pary and kill most of the time here its much harder as enemies can get enraged and do a single attack you can't stop unles you use an ability or just avoid it. this means you have to actualy pay some attention or your gone find your self dead rather fast plus you cant stun lock like you could before. 

Romance in this game is kinda bad there nothing special to it it just do a mission now you can go into a house with the person but other then a kissing scene you wont see much and thats not really a problem what more of a problem is that it means nothing would be nice if they become your companion you can call upon to battle with you rather then just one scene and you never see them again. you can recruit some of them to your ship or you can find higher level better recruits instead. I cant complain about it too much since its neither bad or good its just there do with it as you like. 

The map is massive with plenty to explore and with plenty to see, you can do what i did although im not sure if it was glitch or not but i got onto spartan boat while swiming to underwated objective and as normal they did not like that and wanted me dead but while i was fighting a massive amount of them the ship kept swiming so i found my self on a different island i started on so it was quite a trip to get back ofcourse you can fast travel if things like that happen but i did not mind the massive detour. Overwall the game is good yea its grindy and filled with borring side quest but it has a lot ot offer to balance it self out i say i git it 6/10 maybe 5 story is nice but side quest are boring but we have neat abilities like the spartan kick, which can be a lot of fun at times and a battle wining move. war battles are somewhat fun as they can be quite chalaning if they are same level as you, but also they provide a great way to get new gear which negates some of the grind needed to upgrade your gear as you can get epic level items if you win the war for the side you fought for. there plenty of customization so you wont have to stare at the same character looks for hours and a lot fo ship customization. only down side is the game is called assassins creed yet assassins dont exist yet so this game could have been its own game with plenty of fiction added to spice things up but since it usses the title its limited to how far it can take fiction although there some of it here in terms of special enemies",True,1539180281,1539520292,True,0,0,0.454545468091964722,False

Assassin's Creed Odyssey now puts a much greater emphasis on role playing elements than it's predecessor. The game now has dialogue options, branching quests and multiple endings which can be decided by the players in game choices. Like traditional RPGs stealing and killing civilians will earn you a bounty which results in mercenaries hunting you throughout the game world. Odyssey now has a romance feature which allows you to develop romantic relationships with NPCs in the game. 

Odyssey does a great job expanding on the RPG elements seen in Origins and also brings back a beloved feature from one of the previous games. Making it's return is the much loved naval combat from Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag. Just like in Black Flag, you are free to roam the world in your ship, which can be upgraded along the way. Using your ship you can take down enemies and board them in order to gather resources. This was something I loved about Black Flag and to see it in Odyssey is amazing!.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is set in 431 BC during the midst of the Peloponnesian War fought between the city states of Ancient Greece. Players have the ability to choose between two main protagonists, Alexios or Kassandra. Both these characters share the same story so choosing one over the other will not impact the narrative. The story follows you attempting to reunite your family while attempting to uncover an evil cult called the Cult of Kosmos, who are attempting to take over the Greek world. The game's world feels and looks amazing. You have the ability to take part in massive conquest battles as well as join forces with Athens or Sparta. There are so many different locations in the game world and each has it's own objectives in order to complete that location. 

Despite being set 400 years before the birth of the Assassin Order, AC Odyssey somehow still manages to feel like an Assassin's Creed game without Assassins. The familiar mechanics of AC are still here but this time the assassins do not exist. You don't have the iconic Hidden Blade but instead the Spear of Leonidas a legendary relic belonging to the Great King Leonidas of Sparta. The game's parkour and combat feel fluid and smooth and provides players with a pleasant experience while playing. Overall Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a step in the right direction for Ubisoft.

I've heard it mentioned as an Origins 2.0 which is probably pretty accurate. I barely played Origins, I couldn't find it in me to enjoy that ass of a game, but Odyssey really is a step up. Combat is fun, nightmare difficulty is at least close to enough of a challenge, seeing as an enemy 2 levels over me is a real fight and 3 is pretty much just death. 1 is still a good fight and at my level still at least has time for some combat. But the main reason for writing this review is I really wanted to commend a single detail I just noticed. I was going through a tomb looking for this tablet or something and 1. the traps actually seemed logically placed (though there was only one) *cough cough* TOMB RAIDER. 2. there was a section where I heard a draft coming in and rather than the game just giving a prompt next to a somewhat cracked wall it relied on me hearing that and trying to hit the wall to open it up, which I'm sure I'm overreacting to but the level of not-hand-holdy that tiny little bit was really felt nice. AC Odyssey is literally a better Tomb Raider game than Shadow... which I guess isn't saying much considering Shadow of the Tomb Raider sucked major ass but you get the idea.

But, it does try to mix it up, with having Witcher style game mechanics where the decisions “matter”, which can either be a hit or miss. Sure, microtransactions are bad, but i think the problems are far more deeper when in the first place the game feels like a chore.

TLDR(because my review on update became almost twice as long):
- Moving around is terribad, World too big
- Requires plenty of time to get anything done, game doesn't respect your time spent
- Repeated Animations is terrible and feels like the game is purposefully wasting your time
- Unskippable animations is the worst
- Even animations meant as a grand reward is repeated.
- Climbing is now easy.
- Cult system is made worst with terrible traversal
- Fast Travel points are random.
- Terrible picture mode that stops you from doing things you need to do.
- Same rinse and repetitive quests
- microtransactions (Obligatory complaint, but really doesn't bother me as much) 

Ok you want more? Let’s break it down…

Traversal is a drag. You have a ship and a horse. You have fast travel points which are basically landmarks, but it takes a long time to get anywhere from point A to point B. I think it boils down to, traversal is just not fun. In Witcher, they had a lot of sign posts which made it less of a chore to return to previous areas again. In Just Cause 2 traversal was fun because of the hook + parachute combo, planes, helicopters or fast cars. But in this game it's just a complete chore. I get it that horses and boats was how people travelled at that time, but havens forbid we have to suffer the same fate. 

Maybe the developers want us to take the same amount of time travelling around like people in that age, maybe grow a beard or two. And if you think sure you have a boat, you can only call upon your boat when you are near a port which is miles away from where you happen to stand, which i think is a terrible mechanic. 

So you might think, why not go to each area and unlock the save points first? Well, sure, that’s a great idea, but the problem is they are placed relatively RANDOMLY. Some are actually close to one another, and others are so far apart it might actually take you IRL half and hour to get from one point to the other on your horse. And what makes it worst is that the game FORCES you to watch, WATCH your time wasted away by watching the camera do the same thing, follow your eagle as it flies around your head to WOW you with the wonderful scenery around. It’s cool for the first time but 10 times in, I was prepared to throw my keyboard at my monitor. And some genius thought to make it completely UNSKIPPABLE.

Now if the horse could actually fly, then it might make things different. Luckily there are umm... trainers that can help speed up gameplay without giving Ubisoft more money, and make travelling more bearable.

Combat is similar to the previous iteration, but climbing has now taken a back seat. Ubisoft never really figured on what they want the climbing mechanic to be throughout their sequels. More skill or just push up. Seems in odyssey they decided to go with the later. Climbing is automatic and you just have to push the up button. What’s even worst now is that points you can interact with has now became more of a texture than hand holds. Maybe it will look better on some PCs but it now looks like climbing is just vertical walking.

There is the cult system in which you have to dismantle the cult of cosmos, which is a templar stand in, which requires the player to do batman style investigations, run to a point then told to do another thing to uncover the big bad wolf of the area. Most of the time, you might be lucky to find one while on your travels, but it becomes a chore to go back and search for ones you miss (Refer to my criticism about traversal.).

Then there is the mercenaries system, which is a combo of the GTA Police + Shadow of mordor's lieutenant system. Its an interesting take but doesn't really add much to the game beyond being an annoyance. (You can actually pay off mercenaries in combat). The mercenaries have cool names, but lack personality as it behaves like any other grunt you will stab in the game. 

Then there is the much touted PICTURE MODE. To me I’m not the sort of player to take screenshots in game, and I’m pretty sure most players don’t really do that, cos it seems more like chest beating “HEY LOOK AT MY AMAZING LOOKING GAME”, but for FUCK SAKE have a way to turn off that FUCKING feature. Not only does it populate your in game map with icons of random stranger’s photos, it would obstruct you from being able to click on where you actually want to go, like I dunno, A MISSION OBJECTIVE? Sure you can toggle it off, ONLY IN THE MAP. And the next time you load the game, bam it’s back to SHOW EVERYONE’s GOD DAMN PHOTOS.

Also, the lack of rewards is quite noticeable. So, all your special magical abilities comes from a spear that takes the place of the assassin’s creed trademark hidden blade, but the problem is to upgrade it to unlock the next tier of skills, you have to hunt more of the cultists. Now that’s great and all, but each tier you unlock doesn’t reward you much. You watch the same cutscene, and you see the same blade glow the same. There is ABSOLUTELY no visual difference each time you make an upgrade.

Sure it maybe a great game according to meta critic and game reviewers out there, but FOR FUCK SAKE, ARE THEY ACTUALLY OK WITH THIS? 

Ahem.*straightens up and adjusts Tie…* All in all it's very much an assassins creed game and plays like an assassins creed game. It’s definitely a different game, I don't think there is enough of a breath of fresh air, sure it's an iteration on the Ubisoft formula, but unless you are a fan of assassins creed, those little problems add up, I’ll suggest you give it a miss. Now where’s my trainer…..

The negative reviewers are whining about a small list of things:

1. ""The game runs like shit, it crashes, so many bugs, etc"" - Nothing more than a whine, game runs fine, haven't noticed a single bug. Sad reviewer needs to not buy a game their potato can't run. Plain and simple. Once had the game crash to desktop but I was running way too much shit in the background and flipping between tabs quickly. 

2. ""The game is warrior's creed, no stealth"" - Again, whining. The game has a LOT of options for stealth and assassination tactics. There are some areas where you are forced to fight head-on but this has been true of every one of these titles. This complaint is 100% user-end; you can go full Assassin if you want. I assassinate boss-type characters regularly. 

3. ""Game makes no sense / Can't get into the story"" - Probably picked Alexios. He is not the canon character and is probably only in the game so that incels wouldn't boycott it. Kassandra is the character to pick and her storyline is interesting and fun. Alexios is more wooden and the story doesn't fit him as well. 

4.  ""OMGERD MICROTRANSACTIONS"" - there is nothing in the game other than DLC obtainable through the Season Pass that you cannot obtain, in the game, without spending real money. Nothing at all. You can get every single item through playing the game, either in game itself or through a Ubisoft club reward. And the game in no way ever gives you the feeling you HAVE to have exp/drachmae boosts to get anywhere. There's always tons to do no matter what your level is, either on land or sea.

I would like to thank the Ubisoft developers for taking the time to resolve this issue. It was hard not to feel dismissed, as developers of other games have done in the past in similar circumstances. Ubisoft actually listened to their player base, and found that a quick fix could and would allow even more people the chance to buy and enjoy the game.

They deserve respect and kind words for a decently quick turnaround. While I would have loved to see the game released in this state, I understand that it can be difficult to know what percentage of people will still be affected and by what problems when a new game is released.

I'm going to leave the previous ""would not recommend"" review underneath for transparency even after changing it to ""would recommend"", but I am happy to report I've been playing the game with no issues and am looking forward to enjoying a hundred hours in what already feels like the best Assassin's Creed game to date.

Again, thank you to the Ubisoft developers for resolving this quickly. Thank you to ""ubiunicorn"" for a quick response, and the hard work to include a smaller but vocal group of gamers to the supported hardware. My faith in your company and your support staff has been restored.
-------------------------------

My hardware met the system requirements, and I have not been unable to play any other game previously. Issues with first generation intel CPUs (which benchmark comparable to later generations) make the game unloadable and crash at the start. Ubisoft has blamed the users for having out of date hardware, even though the same hardware runs AC: Origins, and any other game on the market right now.

The issue seems to be with first gen CPUs not supporting AVX. Previous game titles have set this as a requirement and later patched the requirement out, allowing those first gen CPUs to run the game. After more than a week of forum complaints from gamers who play every other game with no issues, Ubisoft finally realized it could no longer blame the user, and agreed to patch the previously unmentioned requirement out in the next patch. No news whether that will fix the issues for everyone, but if you buy this game (which I've heard is wonderful) be prepared for the game to crash at startup. Be prepared to spend much of your own time troubleshooting why this AAA title wont run despite meeting the initial system requirements. Plenty of gamers playing every other title out right now have had to return the game for a refund and wait to see if the AVX issues patching fixes most of the crashes.

Hoping one day soon, I can edit this review after actually being able to play the game, but for now it's put a bad taste in my mouth regarding Ubisoft. They are currently in the shitter with EA for dismissing a good chunk of their player base and then blaming the user for the issue while they scramble to resolve it behind closed doors.",True,1539149969,1539333539,True,0,0,0.541122198104858398,False

Now i of course know that Ubisoft has never provided support for medium to low end systems, if you see the sticky posts you can clearly see they are focused on providing support for people that bought new hardware from their sponsors or likewise. Normally it would be hard to believe, but not with this company.

I've had this old system for 6 years, i'm 70% over minimum but 30% roughly from recommended, for 30 years i've been playing games so i know that this should be more than enough to run a game on low setting with 30 fps, i think most would agree with me here hopefully.

I7-3770k overclocked, 16gb ram,  evo 512gb ssd drive and a old 690 GTX.

Now while this is a very old gpu 6-7 years give or take, it does what it's supposed to in any other game, never had to run a game below medium until Origins and now Odyssey. I believe this is due to lack of care, extreme layers of DRM which hurts low end more than anyone else since they have very little to take from as it is.

The main reason for this is of course there's no support for multi-gpu's or sli, which happens to be what i need to crank this up from low to medium/high with 30 fps, it sounds crazy when you list it like that, but that's how much my system needs that extra gpu for a demanding game like this and when you have a low end system it can make all the difference.

Now in Origins a certain developer gave a promising statement that sli would be added later on, of course i needed this to play the game so i trusted them which was probably not wise with all the experience i have with that company because they never delivered. With odyssey it's a very different story because there are clear evidence that the second gpu is being used without the profile, the game does not make use of it but it is running in the game and that shows the game has potential to use it.

Now it's no secret Ubisoft has little to no care or respect for low-end hardware users, they want you to run out and buy what's new from their sponsors this makes their optimization a bit easier.

I do play games since the era of Diablo 1 and even beffore and this is one of the best games I did play in my life, ever. The world is stuning, doesnt feel generated and you just believe that you really are on some huge epic adventure. I don't see any minus I could mentioned right now (30 hours played) Its awesome game. I really love the Mercenary (bounty hunters) system, when they rush on every place where I am just giving hell to some enemies, to receive the reward on my head. They always drop some fantastic piece of gear :) I do like Witcher 3 very much, but I do enjoy AC Odyssey much more. The only think I do wish for AC Odyssey right now is coop. If this game is done like The Division, that you can play it with 2 - 6 people, that would be really masterpiece in my opinion. The possiblity to play this with my brothers, to sail one warship together, to be able to hunt legendary beasts in group, fight conquest battles side by side and attack the forts in commando style, that gives me goose bumps. I would fell like  one of those hero dudes from movie Clash of the Titans :) Also the map seems to be huuuge, so we could live our own Oddysey for lots of hours :)  This is after looong time first game I don't regret those 60 euros a bit. I am already decided to buy seasson pass and play this till my head don't blow up :) Awesome game!

I do recommend play it on exploration mode. Its much more fun and you will never really got lost, dont worry. All you need is use Ikaros to scan world from the sky and follow the ring target signaling Ikaros sees. If there is some important thing, the ring will appear and will somehow ""pulse"" as you are closer to that important object. This way you will really feel some connection with Ikaros like with your friend and guide. I still think he is God :)

Initially gave it a thumbs down because of the horrible graphics issues. it took me a lot of time to solve it, but now that I have, it runs perfectly.

Here are the main things that caused the problems. I have a GTX 980ti with a 6700k 4ghz processor.

1. Vsync: set this to on. Adaptive anti aliasing or  setting vsync to off causes major stuttering problems and fluctuations on fps that go from 90 one second and 20 the next.
2. I set anti-aliasing to low. It doesn't make much a difference at the resolution I am running the game at anyway (2k).
3. Display set to Fullscreen.

The problem with the game is that these settings sometimes change when you alt tab out of it. It sets the display size to borderless and for some reason turned vsync off. This caused a horrible drop in fps and overall quality. It also made my CPU temperature spike from 30C- 35C idle to 80C-94C. 

The game itself is great. I was apprehensive about the focus on Naval combat and I did not enjoy it at all in Origins, but its actually not forced upon you often, and it is really fun as there are actual incentives for doing so, rather than simply progressing past a point in the story.

The game has dialogue choices, but the game is very linear in how the story progresses. Initially it seemed like there was going to be some choice and consequences, but it became apparent that it was just that one occasion where you were given a meaningful choice. 

You do get to pick the order in which you do some missions, but that is about it. Comparing this game to the witcher 3 would be like comparing a Honda Civic to a Lamborghini. Yeah they are both cars, but one is exponentially better than the other. That is not to say this game is bad. Its a great game, definitely on par with Origins, maybe even a bit better despite the SJW agenda obvious in it (half the warriors are female, which is ridiculous for a game set in Ancient Greece. A female protagonist seemed like an interesting idea, except she is a carbon copy of the male one with the same lines. Nobody even acknowledges the fact that she is a woman, which is ridiculous.)

The game just plays it safe at every option, no risks, no controversial subjects, no soul. The gameplay itself is fun, and the story was initially really compelling, but it soon became obvious that the writers toe the politically correct line so hard that they would rather break their feet than cross it. Spartan women were known for being exceptional in the Greek world. They trained to fight as a last resort, and were stronger and seen as being more beautiful than the women of any other greek city. But Greece was a severely masculine society where women did not participate in manly activities. Not acknowledging this and the way women still managed to be powerful and influential despite these limitations does a disservice to them. The game essentially portrays them as being identical to men in all but appearance. There are a lot of women running around who are much bigger than you, fighting as soldiers btw. It just takes away from the emotion of the story, and I think this just brings what could have been a great game down to just another by the books ubisoft game.  

Slavery is barely addressed. You have a couple missions about how slaves are treated horribly, but that is it. No exploration of the complex relationship between slaves and masters, or even a mention of the fact that Sparta was a society built upon terrorizing its majority slave (Helot) population. No mention of the fact that Athens wealth was built upon the suffering of countless slaves working in their silver mines. Instead Athens is this wonderful place where free thinkers and democracy is valued. The game would have been a lot better if it had focused upon the paradoxical nature of this society, or had even bothered to acknowledge it.",True,1539120823,1539711089,True,0,0,0,False

0,75,21,7292,2558,76561198116405688,0,english,False,45195509,"Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.

I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.

The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity; an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.

IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with deeper and more rewarding roleplaying, far better combat, a much better story, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.

For more detail, feel free to read on.

The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development, as more effort is put into Odyssey’s main story and side quests, and the addition of dialogue options is a welcome breath of fresh air to the series. This was hampered, though, by some puzzlingly bad voice acting by the main character, Alexios’, voice actor (I didn’t play as Kassandra so I can’t comment on her performance). The story features deeper, more interesting characters than Origins and had me genuinely caring about what happened for the first time since Assassin’s Creed II. Bravo to Ubisoft for realizing that good writing is irreplaceable.

Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.

The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.

A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another; chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.

There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.

History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.

I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.

The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.

The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.

In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.

Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds wonderful new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.",True,1539118588,1539118859,True,23,381,0.851498961448669434,False

is it a reskin of Origins, in part maybe.
The game is graphically gorgeous, if you have the gpu and cpu to run it properly.
They added naval combat comparable to AC: Black Flag, its fun, rewarding and entertaining and there is so much to do i sometimes start doing a quest, and get lost sinking pirate ships or simply sailing around the agaeis.
Not sure if there where dolphins and wales in these seas at that time... they are lovely made, might be unrealistic though, as well as the great white sharks, who i think prefere other climate zones.

Pro's:
- gorgeous graphics, entertaining storyline and quests.
- Huge map with actualy more then enough to do, sometimes a bit too much.
- good and solid combat system (yes close to origins with some new tweaks and variations)
- Very good feel into the ancient greece world (a bit too modern dialogue maybe)

Con's
- very resourcehungry and needs more then a mediocre setup to run well.
- Upgrading gear, and keeping it up to date with your level can become a full time job, to the point where you hunt and gather more then you actually do missions.
- Sometimes the conquest map reminds me of Fallout 4 and the settlements, enough said

customisation of your gear and ship is also pretty good , it could have been better by adding character customisation and id love to make my own sail and color scheme for my ship and armor...... then again they love to sell u cosmetic packs on top of the game.

id say the only bad thing about this game is the resource grind and lack of customisation/coloring like i stated before. but then again its a far better RPG then most titles that came out the last few years ... only one i can compare is the witcher3

Meh. I think the assassins creed franchise is simply dead. This game has exactly the same problems as previous games of the series. WAY too repetitive and exactly the same stuff as AC origins. I really apreciated origins because of the Egyptian setting, but here we are in a random mediterranean setting that is nothing special. Sure the game has amazing graphics and awesome world building but it is simply recycled and repetitive. The combat and the characters are a lot better than in origins and you even have dialogue options; but good characters don't mean anything if the story is simply the exact same as origins (spoiler: you fight a evil cult wearing masks that is even older than the one in origins....can't wait for assassins creed primal where you need to fight the evil masked fertility goddes cult....), and the dialogue options don't really matter since the outcome is always the same. For the naval battle which is quite important in this one I expected progress compared to black flag which had awesome ships, fights and water....nope.....total regression, its boring....they could have done so many things but no just ram into all ships and win... there are so many mechanics they could have integrated.....

I've enjoyed this game thus far (about 33 hours in), and will continue to enjoy it. The game is quite massive, with plenty of things to do. Instead of the old Assassin's Creed combat system of Counter-Kill everything until no one else is standing, we've got an RPG system that at first I wasn't too sure of but I've grown to like. You've got Far Cry crafting, and even elements of the Shadow of Mordor/War Nemesis system, much to my delight. 

At the start of the game you are given the choice between two characters, Alexios, and Kassandra. This choice is permanent and cannot be changed (similar to For Honor Single Player). The game dialogue is written in a way to make this choice mostly unimportant, as most dialogue is gender neutral. I chose Kassandra, and the fact that I'm a badass woman running around in ancient Greece is never brought up. Romance in the game is shallow, after doing the deed you never speak to them again unless they show up in a quest.

Dialogue of randomly generated quests don't always line up with what they want you to do, giving them a gamey feel, making it obvious that they are randomly generated Everyone seems to know who I am, yet don't care that I've massacared countless of their fellow soldiers just a moment ago; if I'm not actively doing something illegal they let me go where I please. The ""war"" is very superficial in that the tide of battle only ever goes one way, then flips to the other side, blue banners switched with red or vice versa, then repeats. 

Black Flag was my favorite game in the series and this game has the Black Flag naval element to it; Functionally the same but lacking the visual elements of gunpowder and is restricted to the much smaller ships of the time period; a valiant effort at recreating what made Black Flag great. But don't be confused, while Black Flag felt like a Naval Battale Sim with a distracting land portion that just got between you and more naval battles, Odyssey finds a balance between the two with fun naval battles (albiet not quite as great as Black Flag), and a beautiful and engaging land portion.

The game contains microtransactions, but you cannot purchase ""loot crates"" with money. Instead loot crates are the in-game method used to obtain the gear that is otherwise only obtained from the store. These ""loot crates"" require a special currency only obtained through daily and weekly randomly generated quests (and are clearly marked), as well as finding the currency in the game world (albiet in a limited amount). Be careful when obtaining special gear though, as they are leveled to you at the time you get them and would require you to upgrade them at the blacksmith to keep up with your level; and resources still feel limited where I am in the game.

I essentially went in blind to the game and found myself pleasantly surprised but not amazed by it.

*Now, to get the bad things out of the way….*

Yes, there are microtransactions in AC Odyssey (I do not know if this has been the case in previous instalments or not). However, while I agree with most that these are entirely unwarranted in a single player game (let alone most games), they did in no way hinder my experience and those who say that the 'grind' for levels or similar things forces you to spend on said microtransactions is either too lazy to play Odyssey to its fullest or has no idea what they are talking about. Yet, I reiterate, there is no need for these things to be here in the first place, and the implementation of it being plastered on the title screen advertising said unlockables is devious at best. Add to that the small amount of in game currency you receive for free at the start of your journey to incentivise you to look at what the store has to offer is blatant in what it is trying to achieve. That being said, it was nice to get a skin for my ship for nothing at all. I would also like to add that probably a quarter of what is on offer is unlockable via uplay club units for completing challenges within AC or other games and that’s the only point in my play time that I’ve bought anything akin to the microtransactions. To sum up – while they are there, they do not impact Odyssey if you play normally. And yes. you can unlock gear and weapons, but they are no better than the items/sets you can receive by doing quests or upgrading gear as you level. It does not excuse it, but it is not as overbearing as people are making out to be.

I would like to add my final issue with AC: Odyssey, and that is the various pre-order bundles that you can/could purchase and the amount that is present. I have no idea why Ubisoft hasn’t learnt from Square Enix or hell even Evolve that this type of thing does not sit well with the consumer base and I find it abhorrent that this type of practice still goes on, if your going to make bundles, make a couple at best…. because this is just overboard.

*Onto the average stuff…..*

I find myself confused that some people are comparing this game to the Witcher 3; if they mean by its scale then yes, but by its story? I have to say I do not agree with that sentiment so far. The main questline (that I have experienced, which has only been slightly past Athens) had an extremely strong start; good character interactions and pacing with a mysterious plot, only for it to delve into some bizarre tale that is all over the place in its delivery. If that is because of how large the world is and the amount of side content that I found myself caught up in or simply because it is truly unimpressive, I cannot decide. I often at times think my opinion of a good storyline is at odds with other people, so I would take this as a personal opinion only, but I found it really jarring and simply unbelievable at some points (such as meeting a certain someone on an island and them not outright trying to kill you for threatening their plans) and the dialogue tree with the illusion of choice only adds to my distaste. If the story improves the further I play, I will update my review. I would also add if you are looking for (early) Bioware or Witcher level of ‘romance’ as the game proclaims they’ve added, then I wouldn’t hold my breath.

Other grievances I have come from gameplay issues, control schemes on the pc and some minor visual bugs, but I am hoping that these sorts of things might be patched out at a later date. 

*Finally, the good….*

The world of Odyssey is truly impressive in its scope and how you can interact with it. With roughly 30hs in, Ive only explored about 30% of the game and so far, that is its major selling point to me. The Greek islands are the perfect era and setting for exploring, with each island having side quests to unravel (some of which are funny) and hideouts to assassinate/plunder from and landmarks to visit. Influencing the balance of power between the Athenians and Spartans is enjoyable and the resulting battles reward you for supporting your favoured army (though at this point there seem to be no apparent impact on anything story wise if you do so and you still get work from the opposing faction if you go out of your way to support one or the other, which I think is a missed opportunity) and the bounty system provides an added bonus for a side distraction and gearing your character if you start murdering, thieving or taking out faction leaders/commanders. Each bounty hunter is unique, and some are quite hard to take out. 

The combat is simple but enjoyable with the various abilities and specs you can spent your points into. If you want to be a warrior, go ahead, if you want to be an assassin that’s good with a bow? No problem. You have the choice of how you want to do things. 

Ship combat is amazing (though as I understand it, it hasn’t really changed much from its first iteration?) and traveling to each island via the ocean gives some breath-taking vistas with the day and night cycle. 

*Summary*

I went into this game not really expecting much but was greeted with a large and interesting world to explore and experience. While I might have some issues with the main storyline so far, I found the side content to make up for that. I would recommend this game if you are a fan of open world and love the age of ancient Greece and its history.

Performance: I have a i5-3570k OC'd to 4GHz, with GTX 1080. Basically a mediocre CPU at best, with a very good GPU. I anticipated issues with CPU-intensive settings so the first thing I did was set volymetric clouds off, AA to bare minimum, and shadows to medium. Pretty much everything else maxed out. Result is a smooth 55-60 FPS with full HD, and one of the most beautiful games I've ever seen. And when I say smooth 55-60, I mean it doesn't dip.

Now, I never really played Origins so I can't tell how much in common this has with that. That said, here's a list:

Pro's:
- Stunning visuals (most realistic eyes I've ever seen), the sceneries are breathtaking
- Smooth, good gameplay for the most part
- Interesting characters, even if a bit shallow compared to the likes of The Witcher
- Probably more stuff to do than in any singleplayer I've seen before
- RPG mechanics work well enough, though your choices are basically just ""refuse / accept"" and occasionally ""get violent""
- Just the general feeling and immersion, it's easy to get completely mesmerized by the game!
- Easily the best AC game I've ever played!
- Love the save mechanic, on PC you can save anywhere except for forts, camps etc. an area where there's bound to be action. Meaning the gameplay becomes exceedingly organic. You sneak around and do your stuff and just feel like the ultimate assassin, until something goes wrong. And suddenly you're in an open fight either running around tricking enemies into 1v1 or putting your feet down and owning everything in a massive bloody battle. So many games before had some stupid penalties in place that basically just forced you to reload the second you were revealed. In AC Odyssey screwing up or getting unlucky becomes fun, and you revel in having to go to your backup plan, or just start winging it. :D
- Bounty system rocks!
- Kassandra has some serious muscles!

Cons:
- Gameplay: While good for the most part, there seems to be an issue with queueing commands. In hard difficulty some hits can kill you instantly. So when you press dodge, your character does nothing, and then you die with your last save over 30 minutes ago before you entered the fort, trust me you won't be laughing.
- Factions and violence: There's no clear instruction on exactly what your should or should not do, and whether nonlethal has any plot significance. Does stealing matter beyond bounties? Which side - if any - does that fort belong to you're about to attack? You learn to look at the banners and to recognize the armor eventually, but for the first 10 hours in the game I had no idea whether I should attack every random fort or not, and whose side they were even on.
- The world is needlessly huge. Probably a wet dream for open world fanatics but I mean, it's so big it makes anything that was massive before Odyssey look like a linear speck of dust by comparison. I can't help but feel like if the world was left only half as big as it is now and the rest of the effort went into the RPG mechanics, then we'd have a 10/10 game instead of a 8-9/10 one.
- Bullet sponge difficulty: I don't know what the game is like on normal, but I'll likely find out very soon. On hard many of the enemies took everything bad about old fashioned RPG's and applied that into a form that just doesn't work. Your character is a legend, a borderline demigod, and yet while you go down in 1-3 hits, every single random captain not to mention bounty hunters can be stabbed through the belly 150 times, and shot in the head with an arrow another 20, before they die. I mean, really? This is by and far the biggest con the game has.

When I first booted the game, I was truely hyped up. I pre-ordered the gold edition just to play 3 days earlier because I just couldn't wait (I'll be hated for this, but AC is the only series I actually pre-order). 

Upon first boot, I noticed some stuff I've seen before. They re-used assets from origins. You won't truely notice unless you've been playing origins a lot beforehand. The UI and some other aspects also feel the same as origins. Some may say it was due to the games being developed alongside each-other, however that's not an excuse. They could've at-least added some different graphics to some elements, or changed the looks of some stuff slightly; yet they did not. 

I picked Kassandra as my main protagonist. The first few quests where you meet markos, and do quests for him didn't really exite me, and I sort-off disgusted the voice acting on that guy as well. However once you're done with him, the quests and voice acting get better. 

The story has me hooked and the gameplay is really nice so far. 

Decisions in quests... They are there, but for most side quests you don't really feel any impact. Example the plague quest:
[spoiler] I decided to leave the family alive and later on, when i sailed out my captain told me that the desease had spread, and that we could go there if I wished. Of-course, I went there because I assumed there'd be some follow up quests, outrage and people freaking out, burning stuff down and all hell broke lose. Was I wrong... The only differences there are were cosmetic changes, people walking sick on the streets and bodies here and there, but quest givers still act like usual. 
[/spoiler]

The conquest system... It's nice and rewarding, but you don't really ever side with either the athens or the spartans. You're just there and you can decide who to help. You can't ""pick"" a faction so that they turn friendly towards you or give you any rpg like benefits. You just help, get rewarded, the winner takes control over the area and you walk off like usual. There's no reputation to build there. It has so much potential but it's just not done very well. Maybe future patches change this.

Sailing? One word; fuck yeah. I'm in love with the open seas. Occasionally I come across a sunken temple, or hidden treasures. I can't explain how nice it is, although sometimes buggy when boarding ships. And when you board a ship while his friends are still around, they're like:"" Oh hey the enemy is boarding one of our boats, let's wait for the commander to kill our friends and attack them again once they're done looting!"" I know it makes sense from a game designs point of view, because otherwise you wouldn't have enough time to loot a ship. 


Cultists and mercenaries... I love this mechanic. The mercenaries are a pain unless you play it smart and take out the person that put the bounty on you. If you got no bounty, you'll see known mercenaries on the map but they won't do anything to you. You can still take them out if you wish. 

Uncovering cultists is a fun aspect as well. You need to find clues, and once you have enough, you may uncover a cultist and hunt them down. Rewards varie but it's mostly legendary gear. 

All in all, I'll give it a 8.5/10 because it does so much good, but there's still room for improvement. It's worth your money.

-Sleeping with an old lady with her husband's consent

Seriously this game is so much f***ing fun. That said, you need a monster rig to run it at a solid 60 fps and higher settings. On my Ryzen 1700/GTX 1080 I can get a reasonably solid 50 fps at 1512p and High settings but 60 fps is just off the table. It's a CPU problem. I think if you have a 2700X, 8700K, or Threadripper CPU you might be OK but if you're running an i5 or first-gen Ryzen (or anything older) you're likely going to have to target a lower frame rate than 60 fps if you want consistent performance.

For the most part, it succeeds. There is a huge amount to see and do here, most of it well crafted with an eye for detail. The quests offer plenty of variety, in both the activity and the characters involved. The world is expansive and filled to the brim with detail. The combat is engaging, although it takes some time to get used to the finesse of it. The main story line, while not extremely thrilling, offers enough engagement to keep the player wanting for more information on the mysteries at hand. This entry in the Assassins Creed series also does away with a lot of 'real world' Abstergo vs. Assassins gameplay, so far I've only been pulled out of the Animus once and I had the choice to re-enter it immediately. PERSONALLY, this is a welcome change. I feel that myself and many fans are fine with knowing less about the modern day events in the series when it means greater engagement in the meat of the game.  

As always, there are also some negatives. The world is huge and detailed, packed full of a large number of activies, almost to an intimidating degree. It can be difficult at times to decide what should be done next and also makes the experience feel a tad directionless. The quests, while varied, are hit and miss in their levels of excitement. Some will see you gallop across the country side, fighting bandits and searching for lost treasure while others will have you walk 100m and talk to another NPC, finishing the quest. The weapon's and armour you come across, are thrown away for another piece of gear faster than you can blink sometimes. While this keeps you on the hunt for better gear, and it's not an unenjoyable hunt, it significantly cheapens finding any item of value, as it will be irrelevent in 10 minutes of playtime.

So far, I've had a great time with AC Odyssey and I plan to put in a lot more hours. Ubisoft seems to be onto a good thing. The transition from Action/Adventure to Action RPG has been relatively smooth and is a welcome change from what was arguably becoming a stale and uninteresting series.

I will be comparing this game to Origins for various reasons, mostly as it's the most recent and familiar game that people will have experience with. I will also compare some aspects to Black Flag (which is my fav AC game by a huge amount)

Good Things: 
- Character development is much better than Origins
- Characters and the overall Story is far more engaging and likeable than Origins.
- The scenery is beautiful, very creative and detailed areas.
- The fighting mechanics are an improvement from Origins, and feel nice to use.
- A lot more Isu (precursor / 1st Civilization) content. 
- Exploring the world via your ship is completely open, unlike in Black Flag where you would dock and load an area, this world is completely open, travel as you please.

Bad Things:
- Enemies take way too many hits to kill. I don't see Ubisoft changing this as it was the same in Origins.
- Ship / Ocean experience is very boring and no where near as fun as it was in Black Flag.
- I see absolutely no difference in difficulty other than slight changes to enemy health and damage output they do to you. Higher difficulty does nothing to make this more of a challenge, it only makes it more of an endurance fight. For me, it's a waste of time, and isn't a skill-based difficulty increasement. To make a game like this more difficult I would change the time to react to things, and the widow in which you can react to them.
- Slightly grindy, you have to level up to continue the story quests, forcing you to do side-quests a bit more than I personally would like to.

The Worst Thing: 
- Performance issues. This game is not optimized properly. It is clear that they are using the same engine used to create origins, there is no graphical improvements, the overall usage and mechanics within the game are near identical. I can play Origins on maximum settings and not drop bellow 60fps, however this game on settings between High and Very High, a lot of the time the FPS will vary between 40 and 60. Ubisoft has stated that they aimed for High settings on the recommended hardware to only reach 30 FPS, which is an enormous disappointment considering that this isn't even a Console port, there was a separate development team just for the PC version, and this is what we get. Hopefully an update or perhaps a driver update can help improve this.

Why I recommend it?:

However, they still seem opposed to lending those choices historic meaning.

Many great historical games, such as Paradox or TW titles, is build on history as a base with the posibility to change the outcome as key part of the experience (like rebuilding the Roman Empire... again). This could have been great to see in this game - the ability to change history to lend depth and weigth to your ingame choices (it sure wouldn't work with AC lore or the hardcore fans of that, but man, what an amazing rpg it would be - especially for us history nerds that prefer to skip the AC lore and just enjoy the historical setting).

Let me start off by saying this. I am NOT a fan of assassin's creed games at all. The only ones that I like are AC1&2 and I think its only due to nostalgia growing up. 

I only have a few gripes, one being the splash page I'm hit with that tells me the team that worked on this game are from all different orentations, sexual prefrences and have different gender identities. Here's a/some questions for the developers that you need to ask yourselves when putting information up, ""Who the fuck cares or, Why should someone care about this shit?"". Nobody gives a goddamn if you identify as a flying pantaloon with 3 leg holes. Honestly, stop with this shit nobody gives an ounce of loaf-pinching shit that you identify as anything but a game developer, keep to games not politics.

The other gripe I have has nothing to do with the game or the company but the other fans. Shut the fuck up about microtransactions. It's a single player game, I'm tired of you whiney ass bitches ruining my experience because you don't like paying for shit, then don't pay and let me buy my sick pegasus skin in fucking peace you goddamn 21 year old balding idiots. Seriously some of you guys out there look like walking thumbs, grow some hair.

Now as for the game. I'm really hooked, thank god their political idiologue didn't affect the game. I actually think the way they portrayed greece is pretty good and I really enjoy it so far. It's cool how you can bang feminine men and women without worrying about promiscuity. I still find it a shame that I couldn't have sex with socrates, really wish that was an option cause that shit woulda been cool asf. Overall, the setting, music and, color pallette are fantastic. Top notch, you've either created a new fan(if you continue down the way you did it with this game) if you stay authentic, or, created a really mouthy critic if you fuck up ubi. Keep this level of game development up and I can't help but throw my wallet at you.

I thoroughly enjoy this game. The story is pretty good so far and the cultist stuff is really cool and mysterious. I actually feel as though my choices affect the world to some extent and— good on ubisoft for doing that. A lot of the quests I've done and stuff I picked are referenced back to as if the choices give people some inclination of who I am making my character more fleshed out.

Odyssey requires you to think about light and heavy attacks while looking for parry opportunities, which makes the combat a lot more engaging.

‘Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is a resounding achievement in world building, environment, and engaging gameplay with occasional problems throughout. Its incredible recreation of ancient Greece is something I’ll want to go back to long after I’ve finished its main story, and its excellent systems mesh together in a way that’s hard to beat. While there are definite rough edges, Odyssey sets a new bar for Assassin’s Creed games and holds its own in the eternal debate over the best open-world roleplaying games ever.’

Review Score: 9.2/10

Like many said and its true, this isn't the assassin's creed we knew, back there it was cool and yet it had a big flaw, it had little room to expand and ended being stale and dull due to their own story/concept. with Origins this broke the shackles and with odyssey it is completely free to grow bigger and better and a much more enjoyable and rich game overall. 

However this game really borrowed things from other popular games, by which shouldn't be seen as bad, copy is always good when its done right and improved upon, they borrowed from witcher 3, far cry, shadow of mordor and more. 

Imo i reccomend his game to be playedon High settings, even if your hardware in theory should support higher, This setting offers great fidellity at very little compromises and yet a nice nice performance. If you got very high or ultra your will gain minor fains in fidelity and an attrocious drop on performance, You've been warned, those two settings are badly optimized and misleading even if you've a high end pc. But they might became tolerable IF ubisoft optimizes the game and drop their 3rd party drm's by which are cpu hogs.... Don't whine if you try to chew more than what you should take ^^

While a lot of the content is your traditional open world gathering and clearing, the combat is interesting enough to make this bearable and even fun. 
The armor variety is a nice change of pace from other games where you could choose robe A or B, if you want to be a shiny golden warrior, or a sneaky cloth wearing assassin that choice is achievable under the looting and quest reward system. 
And with how the upgrade system works, if you like the way something looks you can level it up to your current level with just some money and the common materials you will find playing. Armor/weapons scale to your level and attack/defense values will rise to meet the average of said level (huge props for this system.)

-Staggering FPS: This is most likely because of my outdated CPU, I'd blame Denuvo but I don't know enough about it to do so, if you have a modern rig you'll run this game fine.
-Weird mouse bug: Infrequently the game will lose your mouse. What I mean by this is it almost mimics an alt + tab but keeps the game ontop, so you are left without character control but the action continues, this has gotten me a few times.

Otherwise Ive experienced little crashing with this game (with the exception of a few times the aforementioned problem arose.)

FUCK NO!

Been playing it for a while now, and the fun don't really starts till you're about lvl 20 and you can stay in a fight without wiping out like a dumb twonk! And if you don't like GRINDING after GRINDING like a fucking MMO, you WON'T like this piece of CRAP! Because you'll be GRINDING for HOURS by taking one base after the other to manage to lvl up.

Not to mention equipment wise where you CONSTANTLY fucking switch gear all the CUNTING TIME! 

And what about the fucking horrible combat system, where you are ether overpowered or fucked... There is NO go between. Of course on the ship you can take on ANYTHING and ANY fucking ONE if you upgrade it just a little.

The ship travel is fucking tedious and really makes me wanna kill myself from boredom. And if you want to go fro a dive, note that you can't just dive EVERYWHERE. I found that some lakes or in some parts of the oceans i can't dive. No response to Ctrl button at all. 

The story as far as i've gotten it, is pretty good. 

So in conclusion:

Starting with Cons
-Grindfest to lvl up
-Crashing
-Boring and tedious boat travel
-Lvl system makes everything ether too hard or too easy
-Boat combat if you've upgraded is WAY too easy.
-Actors are fucking retards
-Many of the talents you have are useless
-you can only use 8 skills for melee and 4 skills for archery at the same time

I've played almost every single game in the franchise, and this one is by far my favorite. In hopes this review may benefit those interested, I'll try and break up my thoughts and experiences thus far. 

Story:
I feel I've barely grazed the surface, even after 35 hours in game. The storyline has me very intruiged and excited to dive further. It's been a long time since I've cared this much about the main character and how their adventure is transpiring. Having player choice not only in simple dialogue conversations, but larger, more impactful, decisions is a huge win for me and my preferred style of video games. 

Characters:
I absolutely adore Kassandra. She is so well done in her motions, facial expressions, and voice acting. Let's be honest - she's every lesbians wet dream. Also a first for me as far back as I can remember in the AC world, I actually LIKE the side characters who accompany you for parts of the game. Even the ones that I interact with for a short time in side missions leave me with an unforgettable impression. Several times I've found myself laughing at particular personalities while heavily weighing if I should trust others. The diversity here makes the world thrive. Romance, while completely optional, is just another bonus and so far these particular encounters have been developed pretty darn well. 

Combat:
The skill tree and overall combat is simple but very enjoyable. I am playing on Hard difficulty, and it truly is a challenge. I'm encouraged to watch patrol patterns, learn my skills, master my weapons, and approach battles with a bit more strategy. Finishing even the smallest of encounters feels extremely rewarding. Bounty hunters, wildlife, and elite soldiers are not to be taken lightly. I'm already pondering how I will build my character in a second playthrough. Naval combat is back and just as glorious as it was in Black Flag. 

Gear:
Wowsa there is a lot of gear you are constantly getting in this game. The armor and weapons are very distinctive, offer their own wide variety of benefits and can change how you approach combat encounters. I am enjoying trying everything on (gotta be fashionable) and upgrading or engraving my favorites. 

World:
Holy cow is this game world beautiful and gigantic. When I visit sync spots, arrive in ports, or just find random hidden gems I find myself pausing and just going, ""wow."" I've never used any kind of photography mode in other games before, but you bet your pretty behind I am in Oddysey. Cities feel lively, are clear in their poverty or prosperity, the wilds are lush with vegetation and beautiful mountain ranges, and overall everything is a joy to look at. The map is huge - I've visited around 8 regions (each having a minimum of 1 sync spot and 5ish points of interest) and I feel like that's only 30% of the map. 

Side Missions:
Some of these made me laugh my rear off - they really took me off guard. I grab quests while in the world iteslf. Whether it be proper side missions with their own story, or favors from npcs. This way is very enjoyable for me instead of a straight grind from a mission board and I am genuinely excited when I find a side quest as most are very well done. Not all of them will be memorable, but I still felt they were executed well. 

Progression/Leveling Up:
When visiting new regions, I'll typically be there a while to explore all the points of interest before moving on. It's very possible to stop in via a quest then jet off to the next mission marker, but as I am not playing that way I can't speak to how much grind is necessary before hitting any level limitations. Just by me exploring locations and completing any objectives associated with it, I am leveling very steadily and above any requirements that the story may demand. 

Microtransactions:
Piggy backing off of the previous leveling discussion, this game does have microtransactions. They are marketed on the main title screen and offer not only cosmetics, but experience boosters, crafting materials, and weapons/armor. With my playstyle I have never been inclined what so ever to make any purchases, but this may not be the same for everyone. 

Performance and Bugs:
I'm running a GTX 1070ti and quad core intel processor. Beautiful graphics with steady frame rate. Only once has it dropped for a short time in a city to be noticeable. No crashes and no bugs that I've encountered. I've seen some odd enemy movement on rare occassion, but that's it so far.

Two was my favourite for a long time, before being overtaken by Origins. I would consider myself an avid gamer, though not competative. 

The first thing you'll notice when you start playing AC:OD is it's not really an AC game. I would say it feels like a mix of Skyrim, the Witcher 3, and AC:Origins. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if you'e looking for the authentic AC experience, you might be a little disaapointed. That being said, the game is great. There are some issues, but overall the game is a joy to play.

Pros:

- Graphics are good, maybe worse than AC:Or but very similar. Certainly more colourful.
- Story seems good so far, to me it seems they have made an effort to still put in a decent story.
- World is huge, 6 x bigger than Origins, however a lot of that is ocean. It may actually be smaller than origins, it's hard to tell.
- Gameplay is reletively fluid. Certainly better than most rpg's.
- New rpg elements are great, these include actual abilities (replacing overpowere from AC:Origins).
- Tons of side quests, locations to explore. 
- Still has forts, bandit camps, caves etc.
- Plenty of options for weapons, combat styles (ranged, melee etc).
- Gender Equality (Sarcasm).
- Race Equaility (Sarcasm).
- Voice acting is good enough, maybe not as good as AC:Origins.

Cons:

- It's a ubisoft game, which means bugs, crashes and poor performance / optimization for a decent percentage of players.
- Feels more grindy than AC:Origins. This does not effect me, I love the grind. People who have less time to play may find this offputting.
- MICROTRANSACTIONS AND UBISOFT GREED.*

* This is the big one. If you thought AC:Origins had too much of this, then you're going to be frustrated with the amount Ubisoft is pushing them in this one. It feels like everything, i.e XP gain, Gold Gain, Crafting Materials, Shop Prices etc has been deliberately put very low to encourage (Cough) *Manipulate* (cough) people into buying from the store.

You can buy permanent XP boosts, permanent gold gain boosts etc. The greed from Ubisoft here is disgusting. This single handedly takes the game down a notch. While it does not bother me, I can completely understand how annoying this would be for some people. The game already costs money, these micro transanctions should be much cheaper or not there at all. I like the option to purchase cool gear, and horses etc. I dislike Ubisoft trying to force me to do that in order to not feel like I'm struggling for resources and XP.

This is typical of Ubisoft, and the greed in Odyssey is the highest I have seen from Ubisoftso far.

The game overall is good. If you enjoyed AC:Origins, like RPG's, and historical settings, then I would recommend this game.

Final Rating:

*If it didn't have greedy microtranactions* : 8.5/10
*With Ubibroke Greed* : 6/10

Still worth getting, but be prepared for some grinding, and being stapped for cash if you want to keep your gear updated.

Note: I have not finished the game, so I cannot vouch for how things are at higher levels. I've played enough to get a sense of the game, but if you only trust reviews from people who've completed the game, this isn't one of them.

There are SO many meaningful things to do in this game:
+Naval contracts, exploration and general debauchery.
+Fight the war as a mercenary for either the Spartans or the Athenians. You have land to conquer and forts to capture.
+Assassinate members of the higher-up society. There are way more people to kill than in Origins (which had about 13 people). This one has about 2.5x more 'templars' to kill.
+Huge amounts of side quests, some with unique stories to tell, others just general MMO fetch quests.
+Secret dungeons to delve into and explore.
+Upgrade your character and spend skill points on interesting skills.
+Upgrade your ship as you see fit.
+Take out mercenaries (similar to how Lord of the Rings: Shadow of War did it).
+Explore underwater environments (that you generally won't come across through the story mode).

There are a few more that escape me but trust me, this game has a lot more content than past Assassin's Creeds. Gone are the meaningless ""collect random feathers around the city"". There are no distractions in this game. Everything you do works towards developing your character & the story.

I'm no fan of Ancient Greece (I think it to be one of the most boring places in the ancient world, to be honest) but this game has given me a deeper understanding of their culture. You can notice a lot of differences in comparison to the Romans.

They also said they'd be working on the game for years to come. I'm assuming they're going to be adding in more dynamic mechanics (such as multiplayer contracts) but I wouldn't hold my breath for anything multiplayer.

In general game is not much changed from Origins, just deeper and more rpg, while Origins was more like GTA.
I actually see here many stuff similar to Middle Earth Shadow Of Mordor, mercenaries is put in same list like captains there also happen same thing is try fight them all, they come more and more so in this kind view this game is more for ""Assassin style"" compare to Origins(for me this personally this is not so great but some people who love this style will love it).
Ship battles here not so good and deep like in AC Black Flag but is good enough and specially this crew and recruit system is great it helps a lot also make game much better.Also pet taming is much better then in AC Origins, pets return on max HP after battle end, that make it more usable, and skill system give much more personalization for play style. I recommend this game for anybody who like open world and rpg games.
Game got and some bad sides anyway, on visual aspect is just more grey then AC Origins colors not so beautiful and bright, graphics almost similar maybe improve some textures , but just not look that great like Origins who was mindblowing(I didnt see any game look like that).And here again this AC Odyssey become even heavier then Origins like system recommendation, little bit improvement on some way then Origins awful town performance but still unstable and really heavy(this game is heaviest from all at the moment, there no else such demanding game, so must have good system if want play this, I recommend at least GTX 1060 for 1080p Medium-HIgh for 60fps and that is not constant if want plat on max on this resolution need GTX 1080 at least).And last bad thing what makes me impression is world, most towns and wild locations looks almost identical that is a shame is just not so varied like was in AC Origins, here if put me in some town I really cant tell what town this is because look so similar, same for wild locations.
Either way game is amazing gameplay and world is so complex, there is just few titles who can come near this game so my rating overall is 9.5/10",True,1539037941,1539038547,True,0,1,0.511288166046142578,False

Good: After playing 16 hours I can say its not a bad game (first Assassin's Creed that I enjoyed in a long time). Good characters, RPG elements. 

Bad: But after my 8th hour in the game, I forced myself to play it. The reason being is simple - level scaling (game world is very unbalanced). 

I was able to turn level scaling off in AC: Origins, however, in this is not an option, trust me I tried. I contacted UBI and they lied to me that this feature can be toggled on and off in the gameplay settings. I searched yet was not able to find it. I searched UBI forums there were people like me. Then UBISOFT tried downplaying it by diverting attention to the difficulty setting however it still does not change level scaling. I wish I could return this game but its way too late for that. From hour 8 till 16 I forced myself to play this game hoping I get used to level scaling, however, I cannot do that anymore (I want to enjoy games I play).

Example: When I left Tutorial island Phokos was capped at 8-9 or 10. Now I'm level 24 and Phokos is at level 22, same as the tutorial island. I personally hate it. I know that there are people who like level scaling but I am not one of them. 

Solution: Make level scaling optional like in AC: Origins

Looking at my hours, I am obviously still in the beginning stages of the storyline. I pre-ordered the game after one of my favorite reviewers (Karak with ACG, check him out if you haven't) gave it a great review. Today I randomly went to the Store Page and noticed it has a bunch of negative reviews. I was surprised to say the least. I have been thoroughly enjoying this game, from the combat mechanics to the storyline/plot itself. I decided to post a review given some of the negative ones I saw. 

The graphics are spectacular, and I have a gaming rig that I built a few years ago, but updated with a new Nvidia card last year. I haven't had any hiccups that some of the other folks have been noticing. The gameplay itself is fun, and I really enjoy the main quests and side quests. The quests do not appear to be cookie cutter to me at all. There is also a mercenary system in the game (ala Nemesis system from Middle Earth games) that is intuitive and fun. The ship gameplay and combat is also a blast. I feel like I can really sink a decent number of hours into this game and it won't feel repetative. The world is vibrant and I think the voice acting overall is good, except for a few instances when I noticed a particular character being so over dramatic that I thought they were being sarcastic - but alas they weren't. Besides that though, no other issues so far. The map itself looks huge. I can tell it's going to take me a long time to traverse through all the territories, completing quests, etc.

PROS:
-The combat is smooth, polished, and feels good. Many unique abilities to play around with AND you can freely respec (free meaning in-game currency and not real money) your ability points at any time. Fighting multiple enemies at once is as difficult as you'd expect in real life, for parrying one person's attack doesn't prevent a second person from attacking you. Timing, spacing, and using your environment are key to keeping the advantage in battle.
-The world. sound track, and background audio are great. When the music kicks in at the right time, fights can feel quite epic.
-Highly adjustable HUD in the settings. Personally, I think there is too much going on with the HUD, so being able to disable only the parts I don't like is very nice.
-The animations are actually good without horrifying glitches, though facial animations will not always convey the emotions of the character. Combat animations can get really wild if you execute someone next to a cliff, a wall, etc, though otherwise they look good.
-The voice actors did a good job, and I haven't felt disconnected from the scenes due to poor voice acting, only poor facial animations. Minor one time characters for unimportant side-quests are where you notice poor quality voice acting and facial animations the most.
-Exploration mode allows you to be far more immersed in the world, but can be freely turned on or off. I personally recommend exploration mode if you enjoy figuring things out and exploring.
-Missions have been enjoyable so far. I've legitimately laughed a few times, and have cared about a few characters. ""Side quests"" come in different variations, which no one seems to be pointing out. The Cult is considered part of the main story, so those golden markers on the map are considered main quests (the game even points this out to you). The gray mission markers and the mission boards are the real side quests; kill this, find that, walk here, etc. I've enjoyed most of the main content, but the side content, including killing alpha animals, conquering forts, etc get very repetitive. 
-Stealth is and is not possible. You CAN assassinate an entire fort of enemies and never get seen, which is very fun, but if an enemy is a level above you he won't die from being stabbed in the throat. So. That's a thing.
-Wanted level system is pretty fun and is a great way to get stronger gear.
-After 73 hours of gameplay, I've only been forced into the modern timeline once. I think Ubisoft realized most people don't buy AC for the modern timeline.

CONS:
-Obvious microtransaction cash grab. The grind wall starts at level 30, but you can buy a one time permanent EXP boost for an absurd amount of money. If you are like me and enjoy exploring and doing a lot of the extra content, you will not even notice the grind wall. If you focus on only the ""main mission"" (which people seem to forget includes the Cult missions) you will find yourself struggling to stay on level. 
-The only load time or game crash issue I had was after dying; the game couldn't figure out how to load and I had to force quit the game. Any other time loading was fast and I had no issues.
-Not historically accurate, if you care. Consider it loosely based on the real thing.
-THE MODERN TIMELINE. For fans of the series, Desmund's death was probably the major turning point in the modern timeline and for our enjoyment of the story. There are immediate and obvious plot holes and terrible writing, which really ruin an otherwise decent game.
-The story can feel jarring when your dialogue choices don't reflect your expectations. FO4 had a similar issue.

NEUTRAL:
-I don't consider it a pro for a game to run properly, as I believe it is an expectation. Yes, AC:Od runs smoothly without frame rate drops on my 980Ti, i5-4690, and 16GB DDR3 RAM. 
-Cannot confirm any of the major issues other users have had so far. Likely, I haven't run into these game breaking issues due to patches (exception being the game crashing after death). Your experience may differ, and I'm usually very lucky about not experiencing major bugs and issues.
-Naval combat makes a return, but it isn't anything innovative or exciting. If you enjoyed AC:BF or AC:R you'll either enjoy the naval combat or get bored of it.
-Consequences for your actions feel shallow. You can switch sides in the war at any point for no reason because ""mercenary"", though there are some good moments where your previous actions are brought to light in future missions.
-THIS IS NOT AN RPG. The only ""roleplay"" you can do is choosing whether or not to kill certain people. A leveling system with stats and ability points does not constitute an RPG, and it just bugs me to see many people referring to it as one. 

VERDICT:
-If you are an AC fan, this game is definitely for you, especially if you enjoyed AC:Or. 
-If you are just getting into the series, are looking for an open-world exploration game, or just like stealthily killing people, wait for a sale. AC:Or has a lot of similarities to AC:Od, plus it is cheaper.",True,1539023900,1540159312,True,0,0,0,False

I've got about 56 hours at the time I'm writing this and I've barely explored like 35% of the game map... Crazy value for the money if you ask me, even if you get the Ultimate Edition like I did!

Everything AC Origins had, but better. One of the biggest things that I noticed was that every creature/quest scales just like you. In Origins something that bugged me was that all of the little sidequests that I had left undone were too easy/not worth the time after I had completed the main story. Not the case in Odyssey, everything will be leveled up to (at least) your level!

One other thing to mention is the actual game difficulty. One of the things that I always thought the AC series could improve on, ever since AC2, was that combat always felt a little too easy. In Odyssey, though, you can set the difficulty to ""Nightmare"" and enjoy as 1-2 wolves take you down in a matter of seconds.

I have only 7hrs in this game so far, I have a rough introduction to the story. Who I am, who my friends and enemies are. But of course that could all change quickly in this somehow incredibly immersive and all round solid game. 

Seriously, I fucking hate Ubisoft 9/10 times... Ask any of my friends, Uplay is ""Ucancer"" on my desktop. 

But this game... Its really not like any AC title I have ever played. And I never really enjoyed any AC titles but Liberation. This game to me feels like a less detailed, less RPG elemented Witcher 3. Which let me tell you is not a bad thing, I have grinned and gone ""woah cool""... I have had tears in my eyes and been shaken by a scene. I have felt genuine confusion and anger towards someone ""I love"" but its just pixels and crap I realise. 

I cannot believe I am reccomending a AC game, console trash usually. But this is a must have if you enjoy RPGs. I have basically no real love for Assassins Creed, but I do now. 

Pros:
- Incredible World, its alive and I am convinced immersion wise. Graphics on my rig are rich are great overall.
- Fantastic Storyline, the main storyline so far and I imagine I am far from being finished. Is very much enjoyable.
- Gameplay is solid... Not the most fluent combat, and the Greeks rocky terrain can shake things up. But very much acceptabe.
- The items, outfits, voices, Greek sense of Culture is all outstanding.

Cons:
- Game is very, very CPU/GPU intense. I have a high end machine and have not had any issues, but most medium to good rigs are struggling in some areas. 
- Can be daunting if you want to do ""all the quests""... They flow well if you can order them right and you get a good sense of accomplishment and dialogue out of them. Sometimes it can be... ""messy"" and confusing though.
- Side quests so far have had no real ""punch"" or emotional drive like Witcher 3. The A grade is very much in the main storyline, at least 7hrs in it feels that way. No biggie... its a ""side"" quest for a reason. 
- I do not like killing dogs... its been difficult but I have simply avoided the woofers. Not really a con... shut up this is my review. 

All in all... sigh... Cannot believe it. Ubisoft has created a fantastic Game. It does not feel one bit like Assassins Creed of the past. And I for one think that is for the better. Big time. 

7hrs in... I give this game a 91% and I believe it should be Game of the Year. Good luck Fallout 76, good luck COD... But this is my bet for GOTY. 

I will update as I play/finish the game without spoilers.

Fun Gameplay
Immersive Story

the ability to choose a character


Cons:
gets VERY grindy, and leveling is slow, i have 35.9 hours and I'm only level 16
microtransaction, while not mandatory, they are there
numerous bugs and glitches due to the open world setting I assume

First of all, Odyssey is what Ubisoft and ourselves fans wanted a long-time-ago, a fully RPG game, started in black flag, and now here we are, a game with customization, where your choices ""apparantly matter"", yes, apparantly, because i've seen nothing yet, and dialogue choices. What i've seen yet, was, going into a location, found an item, and later on, i needed to complete a quest, and the quest giver said, ""oh you already have it"", yea, but a lot of things ruin that immersion.
Side characters in this game have a lot of potential, everyone has charisma and a nice story, while Alexios has a poor voice acting, looks like an imature actor, did not play Kassandra yet.
Characters expression are fantastic, and they look real in every conversation.

[h1]Customization & drop system[/h1]
All started in unity, where u could customize most of your gear, now you can't change colors, but you can decide every item you wanna wear, sword, bow, helm, gloves, etc, i liked shields, but they took it off. What i did not like , was having items from a set, spread across the map or quests, or you drop the entire set, or you don't drop it. but atleast you can have 50 dif looks because of this system, 


[h1]Bounty System[/h1]
For me, it was a nice addition, and a great upgrade from the Phylakes system, but there are a few meeeehs.
Phylakes were bounty hunters that had specific provinces, and they would walk around it, in Odyssey, there seems to be an unlimited number of bounty hunters, and if you attack a camp and they see you, they will spawn on the entrance, that for me breaks the immersion, if they're roamming the world, how do they appear? happened to me, having 5 bounty hunters, plus 5 bosses, so i had to defeat 10 ""bosses"" at the same time.

[h1]Combat & Gameplay[/h1]
They wanted to make combat more realistic, dodge was 2 fast on origins, now it is slower, but cluncky.
Having legendary swords or epic change nothing, most of your enemies take tons and tons of damage in you, while you take nothing on a simple enemy, even if your weapon has fully been upgraded, or if is legendary, on Origins that would not happen, again, immersion goes away.
The skill tree was a nice addition, with skills, but they could make it further, you can only use 4 skills in a time.
People are complaining ""Assassin's Creed is about assassins"", well you have 3 classes,the hunter, the warrior, and the assassin, if you wanna be an assassin, choose it. Actually that's one of the things i did not liked it, the damage you do to kill stealthy, is based on a skill, that never happened on assassins creed, and for me is a downgrade, a huge one, you need to fully upgrade a skill in order to fully kill an enemy from above, bellow, or behind, so until high levels, u can't do a fort without being seen, does that make sense? no, on lower levels you are weak, we need to be stealthy.
I felt the necessity for hunt, odyssey lacks that, origins had it, in a small amount.
Tombs now are meeehhh, in Origins they were amazing, and you had to search around in order to figure out how to complete it.
Arena is back again, but higher level now.

[h1]Naval combat[/h1]
The Adrestia is your player-home now, says Ubisoft, but you don't have a captain room anymore, the combat is not funny, looks rushed, ship hitboxes are stupid, you can navegate near islands, there's no colission with islands, there's no fun anymore by boarding ships, because most of  them only have 5 enemies inside... alteast water locations are back, but they were much better desgined in black flag, much much better. The Adrestia is basically a way to go trough islands, but thats pretty much it.

[h1]Skills[/h1]
They game now uses a skill tree where u can unlouck and upgrade skills, use them in combat in order to defeat your enemies more easly, to be honest, i liked it, but like the combat, seems useless most times, seems cluncky, hit boxes don't look good, even if you have a lot of warrior equips, with warrior stats, you always take more damage or in Assassin, or in Hunter, skill tree looks rushed, like the whole game.

[h1]World, and graphics[/h1]
I think the world isn't much bigger than Origins, but atleast it looks relevante, because there are a lot of locations that are not in the map, like bandits, historical locations, even lakes, or other relevant locations.
Having black flag gameplay plus origins was a nice move from ubisoft, taking players that have mixed tastes.
In my opinion, the game looks better than Origins, in textures and in lighting, much more vibrant and colorful, i don't know in terms on sharpening, because i use AA in medium.
The game runs much better in Athens than in Alexandria.

[h1]Optimization[/h1]
I have less fps in this game than in Origins, but i also felt less stutering in this title.
I'm using a  gtx 1060 3gb and i7 4790 12GB RAM, and im playing with 35-75 fps, places where fog and fire are in high intensity, it seems to blow our fps down, but let me tell you, in my opniion optimization is decent, playing with 40-45 fps does not look like i was having lagg, is smoth.
Forza Horizon, and a lot more games, you don't need a huge rig to run games in ultra, now ubisoft, game by game, optimization is worse and worse, a company with your size should be ashamed, is ridiculous, ubisoft is getting famous by being one of the worse, a company that was one of the best, when they gave us farcry3, assassins creed II, etc.

[h1]Conquest battles[/h1]
Great addition to the game, but makes no sense in most times, you attack a fort on Spartans or Athenians, you kill their general, and than, you can choose if you want to allie with sparta or athens, makes no sense, again, no immersion there, not at all, you should have make a quest to choose each one to help, because we can retake provinces over and over again, without choosing a side.

I'm a fanboy, and for those who say this is not Assassin's Creed, let me tell you, you even know what Assassin's Creed is? no is not about Assassin's, this franchise was always focused on the Pieces of Eden, built by the ISU civilization, those who came before, and these pieces had powers, one day the templars appeard, and the Assassin's decided to stop them, this is a small resume about Assassin's Creed, if you don't like it, just don't buy it, the game is fun, runs well, looks good, has tons and tons of quests and locations.

- The choices really made me think what to do. Compare to Origins and older series which is guided-scripted storyline and just play to complete the mission.
- The Exploration mode changed the way it's used to play. Usually, all Assassin's Creed series up to Origins just follow the marker for completing the mission. But, Odyssey uses examination and [b]clue[/b] first to track down and make progress for the mission.
- The map..... I'm not sure but I feel the map in Odyssey is bigger than the Origins. [i]Maybe because of the sea[/i]. But really, 21 hrs of playing and just a few synced viewpoints.
- The Phylakes in the Origins changed to the Bounty Hunters. The difference is these bounty hunters [b]track[/b] Alexios/Kassandra last position, while the Phylakes don't track Bayek. Those hunters really made me feel like criminal... gosh...
- [b]New[/b] 8 legendary animals with [b]THICK HP!!![/b]. And even can summon its friends(?) to attack you. [i]I died ;_;[/i]
- [b]New[/b] cultists! This cult is a proto-templar (Templar in the past). And the members of the cult are so many........ And we need to kill them all........ HELP
- The combat system is still the same as Origins. With some tweaks like the bows for example...
- The naval combat got more focused and can upgrade your ship like in ACBF. Also since Greece is pretty much has many small islands... [i]and pirates[/i]
- The underwater sites are here too with sharks :) Yeah, sharks... I hate sharks :)
- The wild animals are still here. Watch out for snakes! [b]THEY'RE BIGGER AND HAVE LONGER ATTACK RANGE COMPARED TO THE EGYPT ONES![/b]
- Military camps and forts since the time setting is in the Peloponnesian War.
- Talking about war, yeah... There are 2 sides, Spartans and Athenians. Don't take side with any of them. You'll get [i]more[/i] rewards if you stay neutral ;)
- I really want to battle with Medusa. And I hope Ubisoft gives more gods/goddesses to fight LOL
- Less cutscenes compared to Origins [i]*cry*[/i]
- Less tombs and Isu sites, [i]maybe........[/i]

0,14,3,5260,1,76561198192473462,0,english,False,45170478,"So, I stopped playing the Assasin's Creed saga because I got sick and tired of the constant yearly cycle. It oversaturated the franchise, made the quality drop immensely, and quite honestly it hasn't been in my list of games I look forward to playing during the year since Assassin's Creed 2. I had the chance to replay the second game and realized how much I forgot about the story after all these years.. mainly because of the oversaturation. See my point? Anyway, a few months ago, my girlfriend pushed me to play Assasin's Creed Origins. Needless to say, I have played the hell out of that game. Yeah, I wasn't a fan of the forced walking during a side quest. It was rather annoying. But that said, the polish and love was definitely there. I did not feel like the devs didn't give a shit. And honestly I dont know if that was because the game had a year to live before I played it, meaning maybe by then the game was fully polished? I'm not quite sure but I do know the game was positively accepted by all audiences. The way they applied the end game boss fights, and the whole bounty system and the hit list that I had to follow for revenge was absolutely amazing.. and not only the scenery. It's probably the closest we will ever get to what things used to look like back in that era, anyway, the game was fantastic and aside from the walking and maybe having more cooler looking gear, I was very impressed. The Final Fantasy surprise was also cool as hell. 

That all being said, let's get into Odyssey, but before I do, let me just say I apologize for the paragraph above, I just want you guys to know where I'm coming from. Some of you may hate that I disliked black flag and all of that but get over it. Now, to Odyssey, finally,

WARNING! SPOILERS BELOW!

Assasin's Creed Odyssey, to me was risky because of how quickly I played the next installment, I automatically assumed it was a dumpster fire. But man, was I wrong. I promised myself I wont buy the game until reviews. Well, nevertheless when I noticed all the positive reviews, and some of the criticisms, i decided to just get it.  I'm currently level 15, about 30 hours into the game, I've been so damn immersed into the world and how gorgeous it is, and how fun a lot of these quests are I knew I made the right choice. The story is absolutely amazing. I've second guessed every action I've chosen. For instance, I saved a family back in the starting area, later on in the game I was told majority of the starting area has died off because of my choice to save them. That's the moment I realized how serious my choices are. Man, I love that sense of depth and actual care the teams have put into this. I've gotten some nice looking gear and I thoroughly enjoy the fighting mechanics. The beauty and feeling I get being at the famous battle between the 300 Spartans and the persian army really made me feel like I was physically standing there. The assaults and defense battles are fun. The bounty system is incredibly fun, and the hit list is awesome, especially the fact that gear sets are locked behind clearing each segment. I also like the resource mechanic, it makes everything much more important or less, depending on your goal. But, all of this doesnt go with some criticisms. So here they are;  

1) NPC's glitch out in many different ways. Some die after a cutscene randomly, this happened to me twice for no reason. 

2)NPC's and some animals, like sharks, bears, and deer, have glitched into the earth multiple times, luckily it doesnt happen often but it is annoying when you're trying to clear an area. 

3) I'm not a huge fan scarcity of fast travel locations. But I suppose that's just a preference.

4) NPC engagement sometimes begins with your character just awkwardly moving their mouth before talking. Maybe a sign of social anxiety? No idea. 

5) running uphill slows you down, and that's cool and all, but too realistic, in my opinion, as the game makes you travel constantly. 

6) climbing up and down cliffs, rocks, etc, is really slow sometimes. Something I didnt notice in Origins. 

8) where is the rest of Italy? 

9) why doesn't my photo of my character climbing up the statue of Zeus not the photo of the day? 

10) Resources are scarce, some resources are more scarce than others. It makes it rather annoying looking for wood. I'm surrounded by hundreds of trees.. smh. The hull of a ship isnt made by tiny olive branches. So I find that to be stupid. 

Anyway, that's all I got for now, however like previously mentioned, I'll revist this review once I complete the game and it's  dlc.",False,1538982155,1539241864,True,0,0,0,False

It has just about everything from greece that you would want in a video game. Graphics are great but not the absolute best. 
Story has been awesome so far and I get the impression I have baarely made a scratch in the progress. I really feel immersed in the experience.
There's boats like in black flag and all the equipment is changable/upgradable.
It has a huge map almost seems too big this early on to be honnest and there's alot to explore.
Combat is fun.
It has a similar merc system to shadow of mordors orc bosses which is fun. 
I can climb anything now! Before you had to climb predefined sections of a particular wall to climb it. Now i can do that however I want. Not to mention my horse also actually feels useful in some medium-long distance voyages.
I can play as Male or Female which is awesome. I refused to play origins because I didn*t have this option.
Otherwise there's alot of features that I have yet to explore.
In any case despite a few minor bugs and minor performance issues which I have only noticed once or twice. 
I can only recommend this game as it seems to have brought out the best of what I have seen from the assassins creed series in a long time. 
I would say it's worth every penny.

[*] The map is GIANT and does not feel lacking in content at all, where you look there are things to do. Since I start to play until this moment (almost 50 hours) I must have like 35 - 40% of the map explored (if not less)
[*] Secondary missions. For now where I go there are secondary missions where some are intertwined with the main story and others are not, but the latter are very well developed to not seem out of place.
[*] Main Story. In this part is where FOR ME, the game excels. The story itself is linear, but it is so well developed that it does not look like it, it makes you feel that it really develops in the way you want. What was done was to separate the main story in ""several branches"" and you can go exploring them in the way you like, first one or the other, or go interlacing and it becomes very entertaining.
[*] Sound. The music and the atmosphere is amazing and very well polished.
[*] RPG Factors This in my opinion is very positive because I like these types of games, build your character the way you like and give it a special look or others. Beyond the skill tree in which you build your character as you like; I mean the armor, this time Ubisoft decided to make the armor interchangeable parts and that each one has ""stats"" and not a ""set"" as we saw before It was purely visual and the attributes were improved by paying some materials and that is all (I mean AC: Origins). Now you can choose, look cute and have not very good stats (or at least not the stats you want) or look like a semi-gladiator that put on the clothes of his grandmother mixed with a homeless to get the best statistics possible.
[*] Elections in the dialogues. When it was said that your choices were going to influence the story, I really did not believe it, I thought it was going to be one of those cases where you are simply given 3 options to talk and all lead to the same conclusion, but no, Ubisoft surprised me (I do not say more to not enter in spoilers zone)
[*] Socrates. Simply GREAT, every time I cross him I know it's going to be a strange and reflective moment. (I would love to say much more, but it would be spoiler)
[*] Field battles. In the game we are presented with these battles in which they are debated between Sparta and Athens and depending on the winner the province in which we find happens to be for one side or another. These battles are very good and depending on the difficulty in which you play, they can become tedious.
[*] Difficulty. After so many years asking Ubisoft to work on their combat system and difficulties and not just wait for the enemies to attack and press a button to defend themselves and proceed to kill them instantly or have a nice combat system like in Origins (but when you change the difficulty the only thing that changes is the life and the damage that enemies cause), we can say that this time they hit the key. I was experimenting with the difficulties that this time are 4:
[list]
[*] History: the easiest to simply enjoy the story
[*]Normal: there is not much to say
[*] Difficult: at times it can be annoying to fight and it is convenient to opt for a little stealth.
[*] Nightmare: here is where I was happy, I start playing in this difficulty and almost cried when I just started the game I died being level 2 against a few simple wolves. I was paying attention and doing tests, the enemies attack differently in this mode, making combos of different attacks and I THINK they even coordinate to attack in the most effective way. To this we must add that with 3 - 4 hits you are dead.
[/list]
[/list]
[h1] NEUTRAL: [/h1]
[list]
[*] Boat battles. While it is an important element of the game, I get the impression that it is a recycled Black Flag and the boat improvements are not at all spectacular, they fell back into, do you have the materials and the gold? Ok, improve the ship, instead of using the same system as the armor. This does not mean that the fights at sea are very funny. For that reason alone I put this in neutral and not in negative.
[*] System of ""wanted"" and mercenaries. I like this system a lot, the more bad things you do (steal and kill) while the civilians see you raise your wanted marker, reaching a maximum of 5, in each ""step"" they add a bounty hunter to kill you; you can lower your “wanted” level by killing the person who is paying to kill you, or paying the reward yourself to that person. I like this system a lot, but I get the impression that it could be improved by changing a few things. For example, I would like that, just as they give a reward for you, you can hunt mercenaries for bounties (after all… are us the only “bad” mercenary?). Below in the negative I will talk a little about something else about this system.
[*]The Arena. Totally recycled from AC: Origins, and ends up being a bit boring.
[*]Women. I was going to put this on the negative stuff, but well, I'm afraid they want to lynch me. It was noticed, more than ever in this game, the fear of being reported by feminist groups. The main character (although they give us the option to choose), is Kassandra, until there, no problem, what's more, I like the idea. What I do not like is how there are women everywhere, really everywhere, soldiers, hunter camps, mercenaries (who look like the incredible hulk) who are women, I have nothing against, but at least do things well, if it's a woman, do not put a giant gorilla with the face of a woman and tiiits and call her Martha (yes, like Superman and Batman mom), make a normal woman and make her powerful, after all, Kassandra has a female figure and yet It is very powerful.
[/list]
[h1] NEGATIVE: [/h1]
[list]
[*] As already said throughout the game forum, our character can not use shields. (This does not bother me in the least since I've always liked to carry double weapons, but I know that there are people who enjoy shields). According to Ubisoft it is because it would make the game slower and they looked for something faster.
[*] Co-Op / Multiplayer. For me in this game could have taken advantage of the versatility that presents to play with a friend, or create sides where you choose Sparta or Athens and you are conquering ""states"" for these governments. While in the game this opportunity is presented, it would be very good to see a tugwar between all players and see how the map changes as they all contribute with a grain of sand.
[*] Enemies ""bounty hunters"". (This is what I think, because I don’t know if it is a bug or something; maybe because I play in the maximum difficulty, I do not know) When I'm doing a mission or attacking a stronghold or just walking through a field, suddenly out of nowhere it does not appear 1, but 2 or 3 bounty hunters that are really strong with a lot of endurance and damage, I saw this happen several times, they appear in ""X"" place on the map and start running at full speed where I am and when they are 30 meters away from me they ""slow down"" and start acting normal (but it's almost always when I'm in a fort or something like that so they automatically join the fight making this tedious as they are difficult even to kill 1 by 1) (Most of the time I am at wantend level 1 or 2)
[*] As always you can not forget bugs, After all, we are talking about Bugisoft. Equally remarkable is the minority of these, I found a few ones (characters stuck inside stones, boats that stop at a port and just when they finish to ""anchor"" they go away again, some odd visual bugs and not much more than that, some audio badly synchronized (maybe it is because I am playing it in Spanish).

Holy cat crackers this game is huge. Byfar my favorite assassin's creed game. I'm glad Ubi innovated and made this what it is today. In reality, this isn't very assassin's creed, moreso rpg-creed. Assassin aspects are still there and the story of Layla is still ongoing. This game is actually so huge that I don't think I'm a quarter of my way in yet with 22+ hours in. The side quests are interesting for me because they are a little different but the main side quests aka the side quest missions with the black background and gold exclamation point are pretty interesting and sometimes stupid. There are other aspects of other games within Odyssey like the witcher's diologue options. All games tend to copy each other to innovate and I think they did well on it. However, the choices are not perfect or as fleshed out than other games like the kingdom game or witcher. Stealth I like a lot but also the combat is well done in my opinion. There are battles between Athens and Sparta that go on, I usually try to entice the two to fight so I'm constantly draining my hours into that. Overall, great game but i'm not finished with it yet since I didn't want to power throught the story.",True,1538968675,1538968899,True,1,2,0.449912309646606445,False

The Story:

Its kinda cheesy, and cringey, but it is still Assassin Creed.
You know, that kind of game who mixed real life history and imagination.
In the next 100 years, maybe there is an Assassin Creed game, where we do a mission with Elon Musk.

The Graphic and Performance

For AAA game with huge damn price, not soo bad. But not the best either.
I am running with 1070Ti / 1440p, and i got 40-50 FPS.
No game breaking bug yet, but i found some cutscene bugs, you know... basic ubisoft stuff
It is a beautiful game with beautiful cities inside
7/10

The Character

I will give two thumbs up for these 2 character.
They don't do that ""BIG B00000PS and super imaginary female protagonist body"" with Kassandra.
She is a normal charachter (which i like) and GOD DAMN that biceps.
Alexios, your normal chill cool AC dude like usual. (i don't wanna spoil you anything here, just play it)
Both of the characters very likeable, and pretty fun to play both of them

Map is freakin HUGE!! You will definitely spend hundred of hours exploring. Those completionist-masochists will surely get a kick from this game.

PROS:
Sceneries are beautiful, the Mercenary system is a nice addition, Boat upgrading and material management, Tons of weapons and armor, Legendary armor sets and lots of customization. Choices in the game matter and some greatly affect the game world. Best example is that Blood fever quest early on. You can do romance in the game, the gender is not a problem. Flexible quests geared for more exploration. Photo Mode. SPARTAN KICK!!

CONS:
After playing for a while, the side quests feel repetitive. I mean theres a lot of them that sometimes I just ignore the quest boards. Alexios voice acting is boring.

And Dont buy that exp booster, you dont need it. Levels dont really help in this game except for skill points and survivability on an Area with a level requirement. Mobs will adjust to your current level as well. What i noticed is that your stat and gear build matters, you need to really focus on one or two major fighting styles. Archer - Fighter - Assassin. Even on high levels, you can't really one hit assassinate a captain if your equipment doesnt focus on Assassin damage. But i do agree that the  fun starts at level 20 above, but after reaching that, levels dont matter anymore - as you have unlocked the skills you only need for your current build and theres a lot of ways to get exp in this game, aside from quests you can just explore areas or points of interests and they give exp. Main quests give a lot of exp so just do them early on to unlock all the game content.

And lastly, HIGH PLACE + SPARTAN KICK = WIN!!

First the negatives:
-Optimization is awful (even worse than Origins)
-Microtransactions are present despite the game being single player only
-Animations look clunky and unpolished. I wish the newer AC games had better animations, like the ones from Unity.
-The game has somewhat of a identity crisis (it isn't sure whether it wants to be an AC game or not)
-Combat feels clunky due to an unpolished feel as well as the weird looking animations
Now the positives:
+The world is large and diverse with lots to do
+Story (so far) is very engaging
+Main character (Alexios for me) is interesting
+Lots of interesting side characters and dialogue options
+Main missions are challenging yet fun
+Lots of caves to explore
+Different skill trees allow for better customization of your character
+Different armour sets to mix and match
+Beautiful graphics
+Great soundtrack (although they need to stop using the Ezio theme so much before they ruin it)
+Ship sailing is fun but could use more features
+Parkour is better but still inferior to the parkour of Unity
+Lots of mounts and armours for them

9/10 so far

[h1]MICROTRANSACTIONS[/h1] They're not in your face and effect nothing. Just don't buy them and forget about them. And for the love of god stop bitching about little harmless microtransactions like this, save it for the P2W games like Battlefront 2 because that's not what this is.

[h1]GRINDING[/h1] You level and gain loot at a reasonable pace. You are meant to explore and do side quests in this game, if you don't then yeah, you probably won't be geared enough for some of the main quests.

[h1]PERFORMANCE[/h1] I have 16GB of RAM, an NVIDIA 1060 GTX, and an Intel i7~6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz.
This game runs my CPU into the ground. I can have almost nothing else open when I'm playing this game. This is however the only issue I have performace wise aside from averaging around 40 FPS with a high of 68 and low of around 30.

[h1]IS IT FUN[/h1] (disclaimer: I wrote way more than this in the original review but it was all lost when my PC crashed) Yes it is. This game is VERY fun. Abilities are useful and invite different playstyles, there are multiple ways to approach quests, and the world is massive and full of things to do that go beyond ""go here get this"" or ""go here kill that""

[h1]CLOSING THOUGHTS[/h1] I whole heartedly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the AC franchise or just of RPG's in general. Just make sure you have a PC that can run it. Maybe look up how it runs on console and get it there if the performance reviews are any better.

As someone who doesn't like the sjw movement in video games, I was worried that Kassandra would be another stereotypical Mary Sue character with very little motivation and very little substance to her personality.  I know that the Spartans didn't have female soldiers and I'm pretty sure the other Greek civilizations didn't have female soldiers either.  With that being said, I fucking love Kassandra!  It took me totally by surprise.  I saw Alexios's character in gameplay videos and I thought he was yet another dull and typical guy character in the long list of AC games.  Kassandra is totally different.  She's funny, tough, and kind of makes me think of a female Han Solo like character.  She makes this game for me and the voice actress for Kassandra deserves a lot of praise for her conviction in her lines.

So how's the game?  It's grindy and it has microtransactions which I despise, and yet I love every minute of this game.  The combat is meaty and you feel like Leonidas or Achilles delivering lethal strikes with a spear!  It's really one of those games you need to play in order to appreciate how amazing it is.  Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who has played every AC game except Syndicate.  I was very let down with Revelations, AC3, and Unity.  It felt like the series was dying.  I'm glad to see that this game is putting the series back on it's feet but I do feel a lot of times that these games set in the ancient world should be called something else like ""Ancient Warrios: Greece"" or something like that.  Regardless, I love this game and it's currently one of my favorite games of all time.  This will keep me very happy while we wait for RDR 2 to come out on PC......which it better or I'll get my girl Kassandra to shove a spear up Rockstar's butt.

I love the mercenary system, both challenging, and very rewarding, especially if you manage to knock them out and recruit them. 

The Naval combat and boarding actions are fun, like, damn. I like it. Kinda wish that you ran out of crewmen, though. Like to make it more challenging, the more men you lose in a fight, the less you'll have in the next one until you head back to port to recruit men or whatever. 

The battles are nothing special, if I'm gonna be honest. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy them, but was kind of hoping for a mix of Shadow of War and Mount and Blade, taking the fight to the forts and cities, etc. Idk. 

I love the mercenary thing, you aren't doomed to choose Athens or Sparta, but can fight for either, keeping the war alive, and the battles endless. 

I wish that your Ship companions and crew take part in the battle, though. Would be cool to see them in action other than boarding a enemy vessel. 

Another thing that would've been cool, is to become master of Kephellonia or something. Pay for upgrades, better soldiers, and armor for them via quests or something. And while you are doing mercenary work on behalf of Athens or Sparta, there is a sort of meter that fills. The more you help one side, the other will attack your island, either forcing you to defend it, or reclaim it, whichever.

- Graphics are good (nothing amazing, but good).
- Characters are likeable and their voice acting is generally good
- Story is engaging
- Naval combat is back and fun

But the cons just kill the game for me:
- ""Time Saver"" microtransactions. They're not even trying to hide the fact that they're going for a quick cash-grab anymore.
- Combat just feels broken. Time to kill is absolutely rediculous. Player does basically no damage to enemies the same level as them with the same level gear, but enemies do massive damage to player. And that's on normal difficulty.
- Assassinations aren't guaranteed instant kills for enemies of the same level, defeating the purpose of spending time sneaking up on a target. 
- Leveling is slow, unlike Origins. Origins almost felt like leveling was too fast, but Odyssey feels way too slow. Constantly feeling underpowered.
- Performance is quite poor. My overclocked 4790K and 1080TI (in a custom watercooling loop) can barely maintain 60 FPS at 1440p in populated areas on a mix of High and Ultra settings. CPU gets really hot (over 65C), which I attribute to the DRM, just like in Origins.

Most of my dismay lies with the combat system. I don't buy an AC game to play as a tank character, but that's basically the build you have to make to survive combat in this game. With enemies being as tanky as they are, blatant cash-grab microtransactions, and poor level pacing I really can't recommend the game.

If you want to recruit said soldier, sure, do a half-life taking unarmed attack, but please make it so (in a patch or next game) that you can kill enemies in 1 assassination hit. Without it, stealth is pretty much ruined, especially if a captain/commander/gold-badged fella is between you and your Target.

They did not originally bill this title as such, and to be honest it was jarring. The game was HARD, enemy scale was out of control, mercenaries would appear all over and spawn during quests that you needed to complete, and without any skills the combat system felt heavily in favor of the enemies.

However, upon unwrapping the layers of the Assasin's Creed Odyssey onion, you discover a really great game. Once you level up, you start being able to take enemies that may be a level above you without too much difficulty. Once you get stronger and enhance your gear, mercenaries become easier to deal with and I've found myself turning the hunters into the hunted on occasion since they produce some great gear. And once you start getting used to the dodging mechanics, and ""get good"", you'll be able to enjoy the combat system a lot more.

Odyssey's biggest problem is scope, since the game is so big, the early hours of gameplay are truly meant as a tutorial, and greedy players used to previous Assasin's Creed titles will find it unacceptable that they can't chain assassinations (or even one hit take out most enemies). However, it's because Odyssey embraces the RPG side that you have to not only level up but purchase skills and equipment to be able to do so.

There's a lot of story here, and unfortunately no in-game codex. Pericles, Herotodus, Icarus, Phobos, Markus, are all names and people you meet in game and since the greek names are foreign to an uncultured American swine like myself, you end up with a mix of names longing for a cheat sheet to consult to remember who is who.

Overall, I would recommend this game, but would caution fans who are thinking this would be anything like the combat in Black Flag or previous AC titles. While the combat is fun at slightly higher levels, you definitely have more of an action combat system here than and adventure game combat system, and that might turn some people off. There are various difficulty options, but level scaling options don't seem to exist. This is somewhat baffling in this day and age of most games being cake walks, and although reloading is fine, redoing areas over and over again until you can exploit something is not fun and sometimes if you get stuck, you just want to pass a specific area and continue on.

Especially because Odyssey introduces such a vast and interesting world to explore. But I suppose that's what exploration mode is for.",True,1538948379,1540022605,True,0,0,0.458876520395278931,False

Performance is pretty bad if you're trying to run on Very High/Ultra High. To be honest there really is no need. 

With some tweaking and a mixture of Medium/High/Very High (Volumetric clouds on medium) I get 55-90fps (55 being the minimum) at 3440x1440 (100hz G-Sync) with a 1080ti. It looks stunning.

Certain settings such as Character Detail and Environment Detail and even AO and AA (at higher resolutions) have very little visual different from Very High - Ultra High or High - Very High but have a significant performance hit... especially to your minimum FPS. 

Volumetric clouds also have a major impact on FPS. 

Dropping clouds to Medium, Character and Environment to Very High and Shadows to High took my minimum FPS from sub 30 to 55, increased my maximum a little and my average was 70ish FPS.

0,175,1,2215,0,76561198041819636,0,english,False,45164720,"So far this game is amazing. I'm only around 25 hours into it so this is just my first impressions.

The world-design and scale of things are just out of this world. If you liked Origins then this will be even better in my opinion. The world is alot bigger than in origins but alot of it are water and oceans. Which leads me into ship combat. It's back and it's alot of fun. It's fast and arcady, i was worried it was going to be more limited since you only have spears and arrows because if the time period this is set in but it's not the case. There are ships to plunder and alot of customizations and resources to find. 

The story so far has also been great. It definitely have a diffrent feel to it than previous games however since you play as a mercenary and not an assassin. They also went full RPG this time around with dialouge choices which some of them acually do make a diffrence later on. Also you can get side missions from people you spared as a previous choice you did in a mission. Which you might not have gotten if you choose to kill them. One thing i do miss is the awesome animus cutscenes you got when you assassinated a story target. So far i have not seen one but they might come later on in the game but it does not seem like it. 

Gameplay is also improved from origins. It feels more fluid and the new ability system makes the combat even better. It's just alot of fun to spartan kick a dude from a cliff to their deaths or to poison your weapons and make their health slowly tick down. There is also alot of loot and legendary sets to find. That all come with a set bonus if you wear all of them. You can also this time around engrave your items with bonus stats depending on your playstyle. 

And now to the controversy about the microtransactions. Like in Origins you have the store that sells both armours,mounts and resources. And it's still quite non-intrusive. I think it shows you one notification in the beginning of the game and then it shuts up about it. One new thing is that they also sell EXP and resources boosts. And many people say that they have made the game super grindy because of it. Well, i don't think that's really true. Like in origins you will need to do some side missions in order to level up enough to continue with the main story, but as a big RPG in the vein of the Witcher 3 i don't feel like the side missions are a chore or a grind. It's part of the game experience and i do think that if you skip them then you are missing out and the game would not be that great. In all my 25 hours of playtime i never felt like i was grinding or needed to do more boring stuff to progress. If anything i was overleveled. Sure i did do most of the normal side missions but they are really good and give great rewards so you WANT to do them. 

But if you are the kind of person that ONLY want to rush through the main story missions(and miss like 80% of the game) then maybe this is not the right game for you. However if you liked for example games like The Witcher 3 and plays it in a similar way as that game then you will have no problems leveling up without feeling that it's a grind. 

Conclusion: If you like huge Open-world RPG's and you liked AC:Origins then you will really enjoy this game. It's like Origins but bigger and better in almost every aspect(unless you liked the egyptian setting more). The side quests are interesting and feel more meaningful and the main story so far has been great.

Review Update (now that I've finished the game): Be sure to read the comments below, as they're still valuable. I'm going to focus on what I don't like about the game in its current state, because I think you can easily find things that are awesome about it elsewhere.

There aren't any full spoilers below (I think), but read this with caution.

[list]
[*]The game forces you to spend lots of time running around for no other purpose than to slow down your progress. A great example is the spear upgrade. It's got a fast travel point but requires an extra minute or two of running before you can actually upgrade the spear. Do you get to do anything cool? Nope. You just run. Does your character gain anything? Nope. You just run. Seriously. There's lots of similar fast travel placement and tons of running just to waste your time.
[*]Scaling enemies means you aren't really too powerful until the endgame when you can collect full legendary sets. There are cheese skill paths that make things much easier, and I recommend you use them. Otherwise the game is very, very frustrating.
[*]There are three ways to fight, which means you change gear a lot. There's no fast way to do that. To switch from an Assassin build to a Hunter build, you have to manually go in and swap out every gear component. Saved gear sets would be very useful.
[*]Choices usually don't matter except when they do. Yes, that's meant to be confusing. Some choices affect gameplay but it's never clear which ones. Unlike a game like Fallout or TES, the online community so far has been terrible about documenting the decision tree. AC just wasn't that kind of series until now so no one knows how to write about it. I read tons of articles and none of them provided the whole picture ever. It was insanely frustrating and required lots of save-scumming.
[*]Following up on that, save regularly. I mean manual and quick. You will encounter bugs, you will make the wrong decision, and it will harm you. The auto save is a joke and very weird. Loading an auto save creates a new one, meaning you have a small number (five, I believe) of chances to get things right unless you use another save mechanism.
[*]Rushing ahead to complete things (ie taking advantage of the open world) can and will burn you in some isolated cases. That was insanely frustrating. I lost hours reverting back to very old saves because I cleared a location in a way I shouldn't have and failed quests I hadn't seen yet. For example, something I did 40+ hours before I came back to a quest giver cost me the ability to get him on my ship. I think. The whole quest chain was bugged and I had to do it three times to makes sure I wasn't screwing anything up.
[*]You don't need the IAP. Really. They're nice but I played without them. Actually, I bought some stuff early on using the daily quest rewards (orichalum) only to find out the store was bugged and I lost basically everything I had earned by that point (thanks Ubi!). I did buy a weekly item this week (again, using the daily/weekly quests, not IAP) without trouble. YMMV.
[*]Once you hit max level, there is no XP dump. I hit max somewhere about halfway through my play (maybe earlier, maybe later). At that point you can only farm gear. Origins had some dump skills to increase damage; Odyssey didn't provide that. That was frustrating. 
[/list]

All told, I spent ~170 hours finishing the story, all the side quests I could find (that weren't failed for a decision I had no idea about), completed a fair chunk of the location stuff, and knocked out all the Steam Achievements. This isn't a game I'd recommend to a full open-world Bethesda fan, but is a game I'd recommend to someone that likes games like Just Cause or Far Cry. You get to run around and kill stuff. Your decisions only affect your ending, which isn't much of an effect at all because there's still a linear quest chain to get there. If you liked Origins, this is the same but different, and I'm not too sure I'm happy with all the updates. Until patches and DLC arrive, I'd say Origins is the better game.

Original review below.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Huge world
[*]Graphics are great
[*]There's a fair amount of player story choice
[*]Good character progression
[*]Faction combat has some nice variability
[*]Enough radiant quest variety to keep things interesting.
[/list]
Cons:
[list]
[*]Everything is ""travelgated"", for lack of a better term. The world is huge, but the number of fast travel points is insanely limited. In Origins, cities, hubs, and sync points had fast travel. In Odyssey, only sync points have fast travel. That usually means somewhere between 200-500m of riding before you can get anyway you actually want. In addition, docks don't have fast travel, so island hopping either takes a ton of time on the water (plus fights) or requires a sync point to get set up and, again, a ride of 200-500m to reach the dock. On land, I can see limited fast travel being a good way to throttle progress. With the docks, though? It adds so much time doing absolutely nothing productive. Also there are several fairly important sites, both on land and sea, without a close (~800m) sync point. Getting to those takes way too long.
[*]Enemies scale with you without the ability to turn that off. In Origins, that was a toggle enabled for Nightmare by default. Here, there's no option. This is frustrating for three major reasons. First, there's no way to grind yourself into a better position. The same enemies you had trouble with in the beginning will still give you trouble tens of hours later. On Nightmare, that makes sense. On Hard, I just want to have fun being frustrated as I get better and more powerful, not fail everything all the time. Luckily my Dark Souls muscle memory is kicking in finally. Dodge roll everything. Second, clearing old content you don't really need is a serious chore. Since everything is your level, you can't speed through old stuff. There are no quick breaks to knock out an easy mode camp half your level. Going back to clear a fort you skipped in the beginning will take you about the same amount of time a new fort will take. That's nuts. Finally, the ship and the player use a shared resource pool. If you try to grind out resources to bring one up to speed, you gain character levels and the other falls behind. So you have to grind out resources for that, but then the other falls behind. It's a vicious cycle that you can't really get out of.

[*]Unlike Origins, Odyssey uses a save system. When you die, you reload a save. However, the save system doesn't exactly save the game state. For example, I just loaded a quick save while it was storming. I died, loaded the auto save that followed it, and the storm was gone. I've noticed similar issues with enemy levels (such as elites not being elite on load), mob location (on and off the water), resources, basically everything in the game other than your inventory (I think)

Are there some things from past AC games I'd like to see in this one? Sure, but those are only minute details in the grand scheme of things.

Some people have said that this isn't an Assassin's Creed game at all. I completely disagree, there are still many many things that keep Odyssey true to the look and feel of the series. I won't go into detail as I don't want to spoil anything for anyone.

The combat feels nice to me, and I personally like the combat in Odyssey a little more than in Origins. The new ability wheels that you can assign the abilities you get as you progress is a nice touch in my opinion, and allows for a wider range of options than Origins did.
     For example, The Spartan Kick is my favorite ability. It's always great to Spartan Kick a Lion or a Bear, and watch them fly back 15 or 20 feet and ragdoll all over the place.

The Ships being brought back with open world sailing like Black Flag, is fantastic. I haven't played Black Flag in years, but from what I remember of it, the ship controls in Odyssey feel a lot more fluid and natural. Ships being back in full, means you can board enemy ships once again, and this time you have a powerful Spartan Kick at your disposal.

The Story so far has been great, I'm not going to go into any specific details because I don't want to spoil anything. The Suggested level for each story mission increases a fair bit along the way so you're forced to go do side quests to level, and it's extremely easy to get sidetracked by something small in this game. ""Oh you want me to go find you a necklace? Hold on, I have 3 mercenaries on my ass."" That brings me to the mercenary system, which to me, seems a bit similar to the Orc System from the Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor, and Shadow of War, but I don't mind it sharing similarities to those games at all. If there's a bounty on your head the Mercenaries WILL find you. Even if you're in the middle of a Story Quest, which I like because it adds a bit of randomness and unpredictability to the game.

The side quests, also tie into the main plot a bit, which I find really nice. You're decisions in SIDE QUESTS can even appear in the main storyline down the road, and in some of the side quests, what's currently happening, or what has already happened will be referenced. So in a way, EVERYTHING correlates.

The RPG elements work great in my opinion, having dialouge choices throughout the game really allows you to connect with what's being said even more, and choices you make having influence later down the road makes you really stop and think about what you're doing and whether it'll help you, or come back to haunt you going forward.

Anyone that likes Greek/Roman Mythology and/or History, will understand a lot of references, and discover some pretty neat things along the way.

The picture system is a neat little thing you can play around with, and it allows you to get perfectly timed shots as well. i.e. a photo mid leap of faith. You can also see other people's photos on the map where they were taken, and you can like them. Did I mention there are settings or essentially Filters too? Yes, there are photo filters. Instagram in Assassin's Creed? Why not?

Overall I really love Assassin's Creed Odyssey. It's in contention to be my favorite game of the series. I can also see the possibilty of some new features introduced in Odyssey, shaping the future of the Assassin's Creed series as a whole from here on out.

Final Verdict: The game is well worth the money. Whether you're an avid fan of the Assassin's Creed franchise like I am, or even if you've never touched an AC game before this one. You'll get many many hours of enjoyment from AC Odyssey. If you're questioning buying this game, don't. Just buy it already.

You can tell the game is very similar to far cry in the way regions are organized, the view points, and side quests etc. however, unlike far cry each individual location and quest feels distinct and dynamic.  Now in every game side quests are going to have a certain amount of repetition with things like ""kill this, come back.  Bring me this, come back."" which makes them a bit grindy but this is probably the best implementation I've seen so far, and they are well dispersed between the excellent story missions which does a lot to break up monotony.

Now on to the combat which is also good but there is one glaring inexcusable problem.  The player cannot use shields or javelins which were central to combat in ancient Greece.

This game is a lot more hack and slash than assassination, but it still has the same counter attack and dodge mechanics of the early games in the series.  This is a huge missed opportunity on the part of Ubisoft to create a very distinct gameplay experience combining both the counter/dodge with shields, one I was certainly hoping for.

I also say it is inexcusable because shields and Javelins were such an important part to Greek warfare and even culture at the time.  Hell they turned the Javelin throw into an Olympic game.  An example of how important shields were can be seen by comparing later western armies to ancient greek ones.  In Western armies soldiers were referred to by the type of weapon they carried:  Pikeman, spearman, swordsman, archer, lancer, musketeer, canoneer, rifleman etc.  In ancient Greece they referred to soldiers by the Shield they carried:  Hoplite, Peltast, Thureophoroi etc.

A hack and slash game set in Ancient Greece where the player cant use shields is like Canada without Timmy's, Hockey, or obscene politeness.  Without the things that make ancient greece what it was the game might as well be any of the other AC titles.  In the same fashion, without the things that make Canada it is, Canada might as well just be the US.  Hopefully since the assests are already part of the game either the studio will release an update that fixes this or a modder can figure out how to implement them for the player.",True,1538938399,1538938399,True,0,0,0,False

0,81,6,2533,7,76561198068502516,0,english,False,45163099,"My no BS review of this Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. I have NOT played Origins so this style of AC is new to me.

I'm running the game max setting at 1440p on a GTX 1080 FE and an I7 6700k. It will play at 4k but at mid settings.

This game isn't assassin’s creed, it's more like Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor but not as fully fleshed out. You start with basically no skills then unlock them to become more of a badass later in the game. It has RPG elements but they’re pretty basic. Some of the game systems just don’t make any sense though.

Things I like:
-It's a pretty game that runs fairly well.
-Combat can be fun and challenging (when the buttons respond).
-RPG Elements are kinda cool. I’d like to see a sword and shield or spear and shield. (May later in the game???)
-it’s cool to find rarer and rarer items and see your badassery go up.
-infiltrating bases and killing bounty hunters can be fun.
-Bows are OP, but you’ll need some advantage because the enemies can suck to kill.
-upgrading weapons to current level is awesome.
-upgrading and ship combat are pretty cool.
-You can respec your character at any time to change it up.
-You get new loot at a pretty fast rate.

Things I don't really like
-Input lag or buttons not always responding to the input. This needs to be tighten up. I play with controller and my friend plays with keyboard and both of us are seeing input lag or inputs not even registering. Combat is fast and you need your controls to respond to the input.
-Really a missed opportunity with the RPG elements. I'm playing as an assassin, but will find hammers or heavy bladed weapons with assassin damage or hunter damage. Heavy armor too. It's like they give you a piece of gear then randomly attach attributes to them. So I look weird playing an assassin in full heavy armor and stealth killing someone with a halberd. 
-All level 10 weapons do the exact same DPS. How do daggers have the same DPS as a hammer? What’s the base damage and weapon speed so the DPS makes more sense? 
-Randomly my quest giver will end up attacking me or running for its life and dying forcing auto-fail of the quest. This has happened many times.
The quests can be really lame. i.e. deliver this to my husband on the front lines of the war, after walking 150m, give the item to him, get a chest armor and 900xp. I mean why couldn’t she just walk 150m and give it to him?
-fortresses will have all the loot, you just burned or collect, respawn after leaving the area.
-You’ll have a container you can loot, but next to it will be another container that says “steal”. You can steal it and is really no different than looting other than if you get caught they might send guards after you. You don’t fence any stolen goods. So it’s weird that you have to steal anything. And there’s money all over the cities. Why do the people put 3 drachmae in pots outside their houses?

Overall this game is fun and once you get past all the game’s random quirks it picks up. The game doesn’t know if it wants to be a realistic type AC game or an RPG with dragons and spells. I have a skill (like Shadow of Mordor’s arrow assassination skill) where I through my spear and I teleport to the enemy as it hits him so I can assassinate him. It’s a cool skill but doesn’t seem to fit in an AC game.

Enemies can be rough if you're a level or two under the enemy level. That coupled with inputs not being recognized and you're left frustrated that you can't beat a guy two levels higher because the controls are sloppy.

I've had a few game crashes and I can't seem to get to my uplay without the game crashing.

However, complaining aside, this is a game that needs to be fleshed out a little more and needs patches to fix input auto-switch, game crashes, inputs not registering, and tightening of the controls. As of writing this, my controller turned off in game, forcing me to go back into the menu and trying to turn off auto-switch.

I do recommend this game but it needs some major fixes. This is not a 9 out of 10 game. More of a 7 out of 10 for me.  The AC games are better AC games than Odyssey, Shadow of Mordor/War does the skills and assassinations better this game, and I bet the Witcher 3’s does combat better. What we’re left with is a mediocre game (compared to the others I’ve mentioned) that doesn’t really know what it wants to be but is still a lot of fun to play.

UPADATE 1: After logging more hours into this game I found that you don't get a shield at all. But more so than that, I've experienced crashes so hard that I couldn't even boot back into windows. I was doing a fortress and fighting through it for 20 minutes to have a game crash and lost all my progress. DO NOT RELY on normal autosaves. Save often.

This is Assassin's Creed's take on The Witcher 3, and the game is not shy about wearing the influence on its sleeve. They even go so far as to pretty much directly copy the fan-fair noise made when you level up. But it would be a mistake to think this is anything other than good.

You can climb nearly any surface with little to no restrictions (I even spent some time hanging from a giant stone wiener just because).

Assassins creed Odyssey feels like the love child of the witcher 3, elder scrolls and assassins creed. Haven't felt so immersed in a game in a long time, i find myself ignoring the main quest and do a lot of side quests for the fun of it, every quest have a back story, the bounty quest feels line skyrim's radiant quest made a lot better. the crafter quest are interesting and captivating.
It is very easy to create a hybrid build that will suite the player's favorite gamestyle. the skills in the game doesn't work in a linear way, once a skill is unlocked it can be used immediately even if the player never invested any point in that tree. The combat is fast and fun, every weapon feel different and have a different impact and weight.

Odyssey takes everything that was Origins and smooths the edges, adds polish to the product in fantastic ways. Toss in even more Witcher 3 (seen a lot of folks refer to this as Witcher's Creed, and not in a bad way). There's also some Farcry 5 in here. The naval ship system is a significant improvement over its token presence in Origins though I still don't think any title will ever quite hit or surpass Black Flag.

I give this a 9/10. Not a 10 because I believe there is always room for perfection and if I were to sit back and think long enough I could find something to gripe about. As is though, I've zero complaints :)

My hardware:

Game runs consistant mid 40 fps -> 60 fps at 1920x1080 on the default settings the game set up for me on first launch.

-three thumbs up-

Oh and note, unlike pretty much every other AC title before them, This and Origins mechanically play so identical that you can own both, have both installed and enjoy moving between both as often as you like with no real re-learning curve when you do :)

Anyone wondering which to get first? This one feels bigger and the naval gameplay is vastly improved. Aside from that they both play near identical so your decision in my opinion will come down to one question : Greece or Egypt.

-Pros-
Graphically the game is stunning. I am not currently running the game in Ultra, but even with high settings the game world is absolutely gorgeous. The fog literaly moves with your body as you walk through a village burned to ash. The sunlight beaming through the trees is as if I am walking through Narnia itself. Sailing the seas is just as beautiful as it appears in Sea of Thieves. Waves crashing along the boat with the sound and song of each crew member is nothing short of feeling immersed.

The World. The zones are big and full of wildlife and humanoids that both pose a threat or alliance. Additionally, each zone feels unique. There are some islands that feels as if I am scaling the mountains of Colorado while others make me feel I am walking through the fields of grain in Kansas. The zones feel fresh and even the characters feel unique with the different factions at war.

The loot system. If you are a fan of gathering various items and like different appearances as you progress through the game, this is a must have. It feels as if you are gathering a new piece of gear every 5 minutes and have the choice to use the gear, or to upgrade your current set (most of the items are upgradeable; few exceptions).

Exploration Mode. If you want AC to feel like a hardcore RPg and you want to really immerse yourself in the world, then this added feature is amazing. Exploration mode removes quest trackers and will not ""hold your hand"" to a quest. You must fully listen to what NPC's tell you to do and read quest descriptions to figure out where you need to be.

""Attributes"" and skills. They are not called attributes but your character will have 3 unique ""damage dealers;"" Hunter, Warrior and Assassin. Hunter being your bow damage/ranged, warrior being up close combat and assassin being damage dealt with assassinations and knockouts (the number it represents does not mean you will do that damage. I am unsure of the calculator at this time). Additionally, you have skills that you may mix and match to fit your play style. From healing, to bull rushes to ripping shields from your enemies, you pick the skills available to match your preferred playstyle (there is a con to this as well. See below).
 
Story and Lore. So, there is a con here as well (see below).  However, if you are a fan of Spartan lore, you will absolutely love this one. Although, there are the typical fictionous character that Assassins Creed has offered, there are still many unique characters whose name may be familiar to you.

-Cons-
Combat. This is a big one. The combat feels better than Origins. Bosses are more difficult, they all can adapt to your weaknesses and strengths. However, I feel there are many times I am using the same technique: dodge, slow mo attack, dodge, slow mo attack, etc.. The combat feels fluid and great but I don't feel a lot of variety, even with the bonus skills. In fact, I almost feel some of the skills make the combat easier (bull rush for massive damage or heal every 25% loss back to full).

Microtransactions. Oh yes, they are in here. Grant it, I never buy them and will never support them. They don't actually advertise them, or throw them in your face, but they are there so it still gets a negative down (please note, this con will not be applied to the overall score of this game. It is something you can buy but I don't see it giving a ""leg up"" as it is a SP RPG; it is just annoying they are there).

Story (con). Although the story is good and involves vengeance and mystery, some of it feels rushed. For example, many Assassins Creed will focus on a central theme throughout the whole game (what is the apple, did Connor get vengeance, etc.), but this game seems to take turns here and there. What you thought may be the central theme/who the main antagonist may be will quickly change within an hour's time. Additionally, some big questions that kept you intrigued will be answered rather quickly. However, I am still rather early in the story arc but it is something I have noticed from the beginning parts of the main story.

Rating this game today I would list it as a easy 8-9 category. I have experience 0 bugs and am enjoying my time with the main story arc and the side quests are just as enjoyable (perhaps even more enjoyable)!",True,1538931735,1538931735,True,0,2,0.522027730941772461,False

Overview:
Game is a true RPG of Assassin's Creed. There are micro transactions but they are NOT required to play. 
All micro transactions are Cosmetic or meant to speed up gameplay. They do not change gameplay itself or make you more powerful. Some will find it grindy but RPG's are by nature meant to be grindy. You are not forced to buy any micro transaction to enjoy the game at its fullest. 
Graphics are amazing and game is optomized way better then Assassin's Creed Origins was. 
Game works well and graphics are great. Turn off background programs you aren't using if your having issues.

The game is very good. The map is huge, the progression is interesting and you can choose between different abilities. If you mess up or want to try another arsenal of abilities, you can reset them with a small amount of in-game money.
The naval combat is excellent. Boarding, ramming, shooting flaming arrows... Just 10/10.
The combat is immersive. It's easy to pick up but hard to master. I love the finishing animations. Now you can block hits from your enemies. Timing it correctly also stuns the enemy for a brief moment, giving you time to attack.
There's a huge amount of different armor/clothing items and weapons.
The game allows you to hunt. The hunting is somewhat one-dimentional but it's a reliable source of money and trading goods (which you can sell, you can't do anything else with them).
The characters are good, but the voice acting is bad for some characters. This doesn't bother me, however, so i'm fine with it.

Cons: The game is poorly optimized. I have a high end PC so i get around 90-110fps on ultra at 1080p, but i know that people with lower specs get very poor performance.
Hunting could have some improvements done to it.

I play with exploration mode on, which makes the game not give you clear questmarkers and you have to listen more to the questgiver. Which adds to my immersion of the game. It is actually enjoyable to get lost at times and then realize ""oh he ment the actually place named East, not just head east!"" and so on.

The world is vast and there are plenty of things to do, it feels like you're a kid in a toy store and doesn't know which toys to check out first. I find myself often distracted from the main quest enough that I almost reach the maximum level while the main quest's recommended level is half my level.

Combat isn't stellar, but some interesting skills make up for it like shooting an arrow through objects including the environment. Naval combat is a bit clunky though, and more often than not, in naval conquest battles you'll find yourself fighting 4 ships at once while you have no support. And even if you do, the enemy ships all have their eyes trained on you and will ignore your allies. 

Time-savers are a blight on single-player games, but it's totally dismissable. Like I mentioned before, I was distracted from the main quest by the exploration of the game's world that I reach level 49 when the main quest is halfway done. For me at least, leveling up doesn't really feel like a grind. And so, I'd advise against buying time-savers since this is a single-player game which won't go anywhere, so just take your time leveling and exploring the world, no need to rush.

So, final verdict: 8/0. If there were no microtransactions, 9/10. 


Can't even play because my CPU apparently doesn't support AVX. My other games worked fine but not this one. My first Assassin's Creed game, and I'm very disappointed. Will not get one (or any new Ubisoft game, since apparently they'll require AVX for future releases) near release date, or perhaps ever. Not to mention Ubisoft also stealth edit the game's system requirements. Classy.

However. Severely marred by AC's ATROCIOUS LEVELLING!!!  Why oh why do they stíll insíst on taking all the fun out by nerfing the player in any way possible. 

1 or two levels above You? Good luck. Die a lot. 3 levels? Completely impossible.

Wouldn't be a big problem...... If the levelling went at a good pace. Well. It doesn't. Grind, grind, grind aaand some more grinding. At a snails'pace.

The utterly obnoxious levelling doesn't end there though. No, Ubi got even more nastieness awaiting. Enemies level ALWAYS 1 or two levels above your character, éven in places You already did. That's just sh***y design, not ""good gameplay with a challenge"" It gets even worse: Enemies SEEM to be Your level, so.. should be beatable at a normal way.. but noooo.. level 21 is áctually level 24 at the least..ergo: ""same level"" almost always means ""at least 2 levels higher, and basically unbeatable when they're mercenaries"" What a crock. 

Ugh. Well. Luckily they ported it quite well. On a GTX1080 and a i7 5820 with 32gig RAM It runs between 45 and 60 fps on 2:1 widescreen @ 3440x1440 with settings on ultra. Not bad.
Oh, and not unimportant: They fixed saving. There's an actual 'quick save' now.

But.. Grdmnt! Ubi.. If I wanted a grind-fest, I'd start-up some Korean RPG.
Shame on me, thinking it would be different this time.
This seems to be the way to sneaky force players with a bit less time, say, by having a job.. (THAT PAYS FOR THIS GAME) or a family-life, into micro transactions? And don'r give me 'git gud' The game just blows in the department of levelling, and that totally turns me off.

So, absolutely no recommend from me. Micro-transactions should die, die, die. And the beancounters forcing it on the players by nerfed levelling,  should all be fired.. or flogged.

After 30+ hours trying desperately to like the game, and only getting up to level 21 ( not that this makes any difference.. Your enemies will 'suddenly' be level 22 or 23 by then) I give up.

One of the few critiques I have with this has nothing to do with the game but rather Uplay. If you don't remember your info than logging in is going to be a series of hoops that need to be jumped through. Otherwise the game is beautiful and the combat is rewarding, my favorite addition to the series by far is combat and ranged abilities.

that being said i feel like this game so far has earned the assassins title and just gives people the real challenge of being an assassin and doesnt guide you through how you should kill your target , hell to be honest with you im a serial killer ingame but this game makes me think wether or not i should kill this whole part of the map or save them and that in itself makes this game great. 

BUT dont expect it to be perfect of course there are some bugs in the game  like 
if you die  the loading screen crashes and youd have to restart the game (dont worry it definitely saved your progress).
 or that the horse your riding is sometimes an even better assassin than you (i literally walked on rope between two buildings with my horse) , and of course the occassional physics fall when you get stuck between two rocks while climbing a  mountain . 

but we cant expect a perfect game with a map this size and i believe it will still be patched and fixed in the future ,

The amount of glitches and  bugs i've ran into is fucking retarded and i've only play for 4 hours. The combat is literally spam heavy or light attacks until the thing dies thats it, no skill or anything required. You know in all the Ezio games you actually had to parry, grab, throw, poison, smoke bomb, flash all which worked very nicely this along with enemies types having different things you had to do in order to counter them. (fuck the light guys who parry every attack). I don't need some over the top green gas to tell me i've poisoned a man instead you should do something subtle like in the old games. Also holy fuck are the physics terrible in this game all the falling feels like its in slow motion (drop a body off a cliff you will see what I mean) and the dodges look terrible they look soooo cartoony and unrealistic like your contorting your self in order to get away. The main characters are uninteresting and super unlikeable bitches with nothing more then being a smug little bitch every cutscene.

Edit: Steam refused to give me a refund for this piece of shit so I guess im stuck playing the shit until the end so I can point out whatever other trash I can find in this dumpster fire.

I was level 9 FUCKING 9 and a levle 34 bounty hunter was after me literally could not do shit but get 1 hit by him some people would say ""just avoid bounty hunters duhhh"" oh yes good idea.... oh wait no because they always know where you are in the world and will always find you along with the fact I currently have 6 bounty hunters within 2 miles of me trying to find me.

0,85,8,4864,260,76561198001807095,0,english,False,45153186,"Okay so I decided to write this review ahead of time because of all the negative reviews popping up on steam lately. 
I honestly don't know what to say. I expected the same microtransactions as Origins, and for it to be just as unnecessary for me, and I was correct. I didn't care and I never was tempted. I go onto Steam expecting a high rating, and no. This game deserves more I believe. 

TLDR: This game is great. It has a few performance issues and hiccups, but this game is truly an amazing experience. Don't give up on this series just yet. It has only just found it's new legs. This game truly changed what AC was in the same way AC 2 did back when it was released. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite game in the franchise. Hands down.

LONG VERSION:

Firstly I'd like to get all the negative things mentioned out of the way.

1 - Optimization: 
This game runs better on my PC than Origins does on the same build and settings. I believe they took the optimization problems from Origins, and improved upon it, but yes, there are times when it dips into the 30's on a GTX 1080Ti at 1080p. By no means is this good, but just the fact that there are no more stuttering cutscenes has already pushed this game beyond Origins in this field, IMHO.

2 - Microtrasactions:
Are there Microtransactions? Yes, there are. Are they necessary? NOO!! I have to say, after putting over 30+ hours into this game I have not felt pressured to use the Microtransactions, once! I guess it really is made for players to have a choice over how they want to play. If you want to get to the high levels of the map without completing side quests and exploring the MULTITUDE of different locations throughout the world, then good luck, cuz like any RPG this game is meant to build up your character and explore. You want a shortcut through that, you're gonna want Microtransactions. I, for one, by just following the story and exploring, have had no desire whatsover to pay for any Microtransactions. My character is constantly at a high enough level and I have 4000+ resources to use on upgrading gear, though I usually just use new gear as they come just because of how diverse and beautiful they are. They even made the Ship's most demanding piece of resource mostly available from naval combat.

3 - Side Missions:

This game's Side Missions are split into 3 main categories: Story Side Missions, Timed Side Missions, and Bounties. The Story Side Missions are incredible, Witcher 3 quality side missions, with decisions and consequences where one choice of mine actually affected an entire area in the game. The Timed Side Missions and Bounties are all timed missions where no story or choices are implemented. They're your basic go-there-get-that missions and they are for grinding (for those who prefer to do so). I completely ignore the notice board (where all the timed missions and bounties are) and I just do some of the timed missions that pop-up in the game world. It's more immersive, the grind is okay, and even some of the timed missions have a mini story (like a woman wanting me to deliver a witch some herbs so she would stop coming to their property naked at night to pick them while dancing naked because her husband likes to watch lol)

Now for the rest of this, guys.

4 - Story:
This is incredible so far. I'm having a blast and honestly it's so refreshing and new to have choices and dialogue options. I don't want to spoil anything so yeah. Love this game's story.

5 - Gameplay:
People keep saying it's a lot like Origins. There are similarities in my opinion, but this game has so many different abilities and skills that change the gameplay SOO MUCH! And if you loved Black Flag, well there's ton of ship combat here, but again, completely unique and suited to the setting and time period. I LOVE how this game handles combat and abilities, and I'm having a blast going through every location scattered around ancient Greece.

0,18,1,3583,1837,76561198088161368,0,english,False,45152756,"Okay. So I am a casual gamer. Someone who primarily looks for the beauty and scope and feeling in a game (or any piece of art for that matter). Being introduced officially to assassins creed post syndicate, and only really playing Black Flag, I came to this without expectation, ignorant of the AC lore, the current standard of gameplay mechanics or generally what should and shouldn't be in a game. I tend to attempt taking on the view of the crew of developers and directors same for film and art, which puts me in the perhaps enviable position of being united (as much as possible) with the original intent and creative impetus of those people. In short: I am happy with simply riding and experiencing wherever I'm taken, solely for the journey and sharing of art. I found, for me, Oddyssey to be brilliant. Of course visually, sonically and conceptually it shows off, I could simply be happy and content with this. Call me stupid. But I found the whole experience to be magic. I am only beginning and at my usual rate of play might finish the main story in 6 months, but this is fine for me. The combat might be a little awkward, but I have grown into it's structure and functionality, and find it great, with many endless options for creative play. The world is huge and the tasks are fun and interesting never a dull moment and always time to gaze at the picaresque backdrops so wonderfully conceived. The naval portions are awesome too, though I felt the pirate angle suited me more in black flag, but that is subjective, and they are still well thought out and there is nothing like sailing out across the seas to explore new territory. I am really living the journey and can't wait to see what the Odyssey community discovers over the next year. Also I love the music, so big and epic and spacious. So there it is , a laymans brief thoughts. Love it.

Update:
So i have played 16hrs now, more than i thought i would have so soon. I love it. For me the main characters are great, the story is drawing me in tighter and tighter, the level gating spoken of hasnt affected me (yeah, im THAT kind of player), love the look, the feel, the missions, the time period; fantasy wrapped in realities robes. I have little issue with Odyssey. I have found the quests, so far, to be engaging and varied too. i have heard that after the 25 hour mark things start to tire, but i am almost at that hour and feel driven and excited. I think that like film, games are subjective and interpretive based on the type of person you are. This isnt necessarily an inherent flaw in a game, but a conflict between player and package. While critics will drive the main concensus, affecting what others think and focus on, i think approached with an open mind (and certainly being ignorant of the lore helps) and finding all the elements that you like in the experience supports a fun and interesting playthrough. 

Enjoy what you can here and deal with the rest. The visual/sonic experience here is well worth the money on its own.... unless you have a McDonalds staff wage... jokes.



UPDATE: Okay so now 35hours in, i can say that i am far from bored, finding this far from tedious and loving ALL of the games various mechanics; naval battle, the mercs, the rpg/leveling,the skills trees, the midpoint story arc mechanics...etc all fun and involving. The missions are always interesting and tense, varied enoiugh to seem that there is a feeling of anything can happen in the world. The level gating for me is not a problem, and what i can find makes for extremly challenging gameplay and thoughful approach. It also allows for the story to unfold as it must. All gameplay is great. A few bug which i expect will slowly get patched. The main draw is still the bredth of the game world. If you like to simply explore and gather and upgrade and battle and watch the scenery as you ride through these amazing locations, then this will cater to that easy. The story, while it is interesting and really pulls you in, is somewhat broken up by your side quests, though i feel that these are all adding to the story of who you are and who you are becoming. It is all story essentially. Im having a ton of fun with this and dont see a reason to drop it now... its just getting good....",True,1538898408,1540838134,True,0,1,0.495103389024734497,False

First flaw is that this game is basicly a mash between AC and The Witcher, which i mean you cant really blame them for trying to copy them since TW3 has been title best RPG so give them some slack with that, and im not saying its a bad copy of it, it just could use some improving in some areas, like for example bring back the old icon that tells you if you are spotted or hidden, thats just a personal preffernce. Another thing that could be improved on but wont because its a main part of the game allready is the basic combat system, its litterally just a clicking game, thats a part of The Witcher that they should have copied is the timing in your clicks, it just engages you more and is a better experiance. It isnt like the traditional AC game as im sure you allready know, but it is pretty different, not a bad differnt for the most part, just different. Most aspects in this game look great but feel rushed,  the AI in this game was based off the metaly retarded folk because if you shoot an enemy in the face it can take a few seconds for him to realize hes been shot, that and once he has been shot he will slugishly wonder up to you and kind a just push you intill hes built up enought courage to swing at you. other stuff is jsut things like terrain improvements, your horse will sometimes when going along a hilly area just vere to a path that it cant accuallly go up then it will just stand verticaly on a wall whilst it realized its mistake. That and some parts of the game can be made easier buy paying real money and to me that counts as pay to win, also they made it so you can buy skins for yourself and honnestly that feels like just a waste but if you want to throw money into it fine by me. Now that was just some of the bad, and im sure i left alot out but on to the good.

This game is amazing as i have allready stated, graphicly its a masterpiece, optimization was done pretty well for what i have seen and the feel of almost everything else that wasnt mentioned up there is great. Keep in mind im playing on mostly the highest settings. The Bird was well done it really is fun to fly around like that and spot people and objects and when playing the way where you dont have all the areas unlocked yet, you use him alot and its nice to see that he is usefull and nice to use and not something you dread haveing to use everytime. Charachter models are amazing as well, for some reason and its probally that there is no depth in the voices (it feels like they are talking from 3 inches from your face and the direction of the camera angle dosent change how you hear the dialog in a cut scene or interaction) it just dosent seem natural in some part but only in some areas not all the time rember that, the lip movement is pretty on point and facial expressions are done very very well. shadows (with no RTX) are quite nice to look at to, they are done accuratly and dont look like they are artifical, they for the most part look quite real. textures in this game are amazinf from under water, to a boat, to just walking around town, the detail put into it is astonishing, the carpets look like they are woven, the walls look rough, the ground looks like its been trampled by horses and humans, the water surface could use some work mostly the ripples (like when youre swimming, there are no ripples going from your side out, but thats minor details and can be easily overlooked), but other wise the water is great, under water is done with the same attention to detail as most parts on land. The missions so far are quite fun to do and each has been unique, i have [spoiler] killed a shark for people, stole a mans eye, made someone give me his money...well he owed it to me, surched a sunken ship, assassinated a whole compound of people, killed a bounty hunter, climed zues' genitals (yes you can do it, and hes tiny), killed alot of people, [/spoiler] and much more content because im only on  like 1/4 of the whole map and im still no where near finninshing this 1/4 part of it, and all of it has been made with care and the dedication of bringing the best player experiance that they can bring to you.
well that was my ramble and belive me i could have gone on for alot more but i figured id spare those few who have read to this part some of your time, but if you are reading this i say to you, if you want a great game with alot of content, good content, and you like RPG, or ancient greek/roman mythology, or good games, get this one, i dought you will regret it AND IF YOU DO you get to experiance some much of this great game in so little time that you will know if you like it or not before the 6 hours are up for a refund, in this game which is accually really cool, Time slows when haveing fun, i feel like i have played 10+ hours in this game and have enjoyed every one of them.",True,1538889704,1538889704,True,1,0,0,False

On top of that, there are repeatable quests (Which are voiced, of course. Unlike... some lesser games...) Huge areas to explore. I did a side quest, a little quest in the middle of nowhere. It wound up splitting into three other quests, which went on to more quests. As I freed slaves, got a family killed, and kicked a guy off a mountain. It was all good.... Except for the family.... Oh well.

Not like you're losing out on much, the game is HUGE, MASSIVE! MASSIVELY HUGE! HASSIVELY MUGE!... Wait, those aren't words.
The microtransactions aren't very useful either. Sure, you can buy in game currency... or you can ram down a few ships with your boat and become rich in a few minutes. I know what I'd choose. Microtransactions are there for people who have money and don't like having fun. Pay no mind to them.

I guess i can see why people that love the original concept think this is no longer an AC game - but i love open world rpg's ala TES and Fallout - and i LOVE this game. Maybe they should continue this type of rpg game under a new brand instad of AC to make both type of player's happy...not sure - but i definatly love the newest installments of fallout and AC. So here is what i like and didn't like:

Positive 
+ loot hunt - you get so much loot and it also looks very varied and interesting
+ combat system - fun and engaging and allows for a variety of tactics depending on your playstile and prefernces
+ stories & characters - the voice actor for alexios is amazing
+ graphics - the game is stunningly beautiful - but its tough to get good fps...i run everything high on 4k and get 30-60 fps on a 1080ti (was hoping the 2080ti would fix it...but 30% more wont cut it)
+ exploration (mode) and treasure hunting
(+) ships, naval combat, underwater exploration etc.... i feel that everything ship/water related isn't 100% there yet but close
(+) decisions and consequences - baby steps....but in the right direction
(+) parcouring - it works very well but at times its a bit fiddly
(+)  mercenary system - this is a great addition but i do feel they have still room to improve and expand on it
(+) animations - they are good, but not great...

Negative
- Leveling / Difficulty curve; so im playing on hard (i like to be slighly challenged but don't like cheesing my way through fights) and the leveling is kinda sub optimal as in the beginning i was usually 1-2 level to low which made fights very difficult and now im constantly 2-3 levels above and fights are insanely easy...there is some slight level scaling - i understand they kinda wanted to get a good mix between distinct leveling areas and players getting stronger but also continously providing a challenge; i feel they need to improve on this to create a smoother difficulty curve...i might have to switch to nightmare and see how that turns out...but when fighting mercenaries, even 1 lvl difference hurts either way.

(-) jack of all trades; this is a bit the Skyrim Problem; while you cannot unlock all abilities, you're still gonna be a jack of all trades...if they want to go the rpg's route i feel they need to make the different paths even more distinct; saying that i understand this makes balancing even more difficult and i prefer good balancing over this....


so yeah..i do hope they will continue along this way with AC...and im really excited to see the next project...Rome? Vikings? Medieval? or even a Fantasy or Post Apo setting?

Pros
It looks good
ship combat is fun
you can upgrade your weapons to your current level for a material and gold cost for every level you are trying to upgrade it.
assassinations on a camp where you sneak to avoid being seen from the enemies is fun

cons
The map has photos over teleports and can make it hard to click. (You can turn it off but everytime you restart the game it resets)
The conquest battles are fun but your allies don't help fight so you end up fighting 3 or so people constantly.  (In the first battle you have a group of them cheering on the battlefield while you go through them with enemies and they just continue cheering)
Special merchant who you can use Daily Quest material for items that are equiped to your level.
everything levels with you so you never feel any stronger, just same strength but with a few extra abilities.
  This includes- enemies, weapons, armor, quests
  The only times where this doesnt apply is for the main quest where they have static levels where you have to reach to be able to fairly attack them.

AC:OD continues the work that started in Origins: Turning Assassin's Creed into a flow blown action-RPG, this time going all in with dialog choices(that matter) and full gear progression.

The game itself plays like a somewhat like a poor man's Witcher 3 in the way it handles it story telling and dishes out sidequests, this is very high praise with Witcher 3 being my all time favorite video game, and Ubisoft is getting VERY close to matching it's quality in story telling.

Unlike Witcher 3, however, AC:OD has an amazing combat-system that'll make you feel like a bad-ass, while still allowing for some pretty challenging boss-fights(as side-content).

There is so much content in the game, that map is HUGE, and in my 15 hours of playtime, i've only been to 2 out of like 15 regions.

Pretty game. Runs perfectly well on my machine (i5 3470, 16GB RAM, GTX 1070). Like that they leaned more on the fantasy/mythical side. The unlockable abilities are better than AC Origins. They improved the dodge from Origins to be a dodge into a roll if you hold the button, which is nice. Using the Spartan Kick ability was fun.

Cons:
Feels like a copy of Origins. Character control is still wonky sometimes (good luck figuring out how to make your character climb down something without leaping off like they're suicidal). Combat is somehow worse than Origins, which was serviceable at best (I really enjoy the Dark Souls 3 / Witcher 3 style combat for reference). That was the biggest issue for me as 75% of the games is combat, so if it doesn't feel great I'm not going to suffer through it to try and enjoy the 25%. No shields; they replaced it with another dual-wield weapon, because we needed another one apparently. All of the weapon types really felt clunky to me (fairly subjective though). Ship combat felt shoehorned in (not all AC games need ship combat Ubisoft!). You're effectivally locked out of areas because any enemy more than like 4 levels above you is impossible to kill, which makes the game feel MMO-ey. Don't bother buying any weapons/armour from the merchants as you'll quickly find better stuff after leveling.

If you didn't play Origins, you might like this. But it's just way too similar to the previous game for me to justify buying a completely new game. All I see are areas where they could've improved from Origins but they didn't.",True,1538879378,1538880602,False,0,0,0.497630327939987183,False

Fortunately, they magically disapeared. Now with the bugs out of the picture I have a wonderful game that I full heartedly recommend.

Why? Because it is a drop dead gorgeous game that is filled with quests and objectives that will keep you going. Wether it'll be to get that new piece of armor or that awesome new spear, this game leaves NOTHING to RNG. Once you get enough intel on a minor boss you know exactly what piece of gear he drops. This allows you to target the right piece of loot to perfect your character with the stats you want limiting the grind that RNG can often impose.

Now alot of people complain about this ""grind"". Saying they are'nt high enough lvl to progress to the next story line quest. Feeling like they have to grind minor quests to fill the gap between every main quest. But that is what an rpg is, you have to throw away your pevious expectations layed by past AC games, and embrasse the direction Odyssey is taking. Personnaly, the main questline is not all I look forward to, I don't feel like there is a grind because I always want to reach that cool new piece of armor, that dagger that will allow me to one-shot assassinate, or even that new ability I want to be able to use so bad.

The ship combat is very fun just like black flag. Starting wars between Athens and Sparta is even better. The map IS SO BIG, holy crap. I think ive only gone to at least 10% of the map so far. The story is so so so good so far....................................... so far i love this game, the only down side is that have the in game story which is kind of stupid, the money that you spend in the store are cheats( more money, more exp per quest/kills, over powered gear).  I dont mind buying the cosmetic stuff, and thats what the store needs to just have. I guess its fine that you can buy the cheat stuff because you can lvl the old classic way and just have fun. Just its a thing that can get out of hand real fast. Just the company needs to have its limits on what they should have in the store. So far im giving this game a 8/10.

- some side missions are still totally useless and boring
- sometimes weird behavior from animals and enemy people fighting you.

Thats a HUGE difference and it shouldnt be that bad (with even some settings toned down and by far not at max settings)

A COMPLETE turn around for the assasin's creed series, Origins was okay but this takes mechanics from origins that were meh and fully realize them.

I don't have the best PC but am able to run this on higher graphics than AC Origins and much better than I could run AC Origins. The microtransactions are minute and useless. I have an i5-8600k overclocked to 4.0 mHz, 16 gig ram, gtx 1060 6gb, and I run this fairly flawlessly at an average of 60 fps on the Very High graphic setting. To those complaining about it no longer being a true ""Assassin"" game; you would be the people complaining of an overused formula. Black Flag was my favorite AC and the reintroduction of sailing being a major part of the game is welcomed. I'm playing as Kassandra and she tends to have more of a playful attitude.
