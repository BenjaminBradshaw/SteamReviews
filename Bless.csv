Bref tout ça c'est du passé, avec une ou deux manip le jeu est très fluide et ne pose plus de soucis. 

Design :
Ce jeu se situe entre Lineage II et Final Fantasy XIV avec un gameplay rappellant guild wars 2. Il est toujours agréable de découvrir un nouvel univers et sur ce plan ce jeu est assez incroyable. Même si les graphismes sont un peu old school il y a longtemps que je ne me suis pas extasier en rentrant dans une ville dans un MMO. Les villes sont grandioses. Les paysages sont beaux.
C'est un jeu dans lequel on peut également capturer toute les créatures s'y trouvant ou du moins presque toutes. Ce qui est  assez génial mais ce qui laisse également un gout amêr... Et oui même si le bestiaire est assez varié il est loin d'être original et l'on se retrouve très rapidement avec des animeaux identiques à ceux de notre monde... Et malheureusement quand il y a une tentative d'originalité c'est souvent raté... On est loin du chara design d'un lineage II ou d'un Tera voir d'un FFXIV.
Il est également assez frustrant qu'on ai pas beaucoup de choix en ce qui concerne les armures. Il n'y a pas de système de transmogrification... Ce qui fait que même si on a tous des persos différents ils sont tous habillés pareil...

Gameplay : 
Le gameplay ressemble un petit peu à celui de guild wars 2 avec un système de switch de compétence et de combo. Personnellement je l'ai plutôt apprécié et je trouve que c'est l'un des points positif du jeu. On est loin d'un Action MMORPG comme on nous l'a vendu par contre. 
Il existe également un arbre de compétence permettant de les améliorer. 
Ceci est cependant un peu entaché par des problèmes de traductions rendant parfois la déscriptions des sorts très confuse voir contracdictoire. Ce qui est assez problématique vu le coup prohibitif en or (pour certains) ou en Lumena (monnaie du cashshop) pour modifier les améliorations.

P2W ou pas... :
Même s'il y a certains points négatifs comme le coup élevé du changement d'amélioration de compétence (vu plus haut), le gain d'expérience, ou le coup des trajet aériens réduit à un prix qui devrait être normal avec l'abonnement. Je pense qu'on ne peux pas pour autant le considérer comme un P2W surtout qu'on peut obtenir 50 Lumenas/jour sans trop de soucis. Un objet du cashshop coutant en moyenne 1000 Lumenas.

Gain d'expérience  : 
L'un des principal problème du jeu, peut être parce que j'y ai joué sans abonnement... Le gain d'expérience est long et laborieux voir ennuyant... Jusqu'au niveau 13 on enchaine des quêtes fedex. Ensuite le mieux est de faire le 1er donjon en enchainant jusqu'au level 21 idem pour le second donjon jusqu'au level 31. Ces deux derniers sont presques solotables (1-2 joueurs suffisent) ce qui ne pose pas trop de problème. Passez le level 31 tout se complique, on continue la trame principale. On se retrouve bloqué à 1/4 de la barre d'xp ne pouvant plus avancer dans la trame principale car on a pas le niveau requis.. 
Il reste alors 3 solutions :
-Les donjons : soit vous avez de la chance et avez trouvé 4 joueurs régulier avec qui vous pouvez les farm, car à partir de la il faut un groupe complet... Soit comme moi, c'est pas le cas, vous tentez désespérément la recherche de groupe... En vain... Car le pop ne se déclenche pas (bug, manque de monde, ou autre..?)
-Les quêtes secondaire qui ne rapportent presque pas d'xp
-Les quêtes de hunt qui sont à mon sens le plus rentable mais particulièrement longues et pas fun (tuez 60 monstres etc...)
Bref tout ça est laborieux sachant que pour atteindre le level45 ou on est plus proche d'un wow vanilla que des mmo plus récent. C'est long, C'est chiant.


Dans mon cas j'ai décidé d'arrêter le jeu à cause de ce dernier point. Je ne sais pas ce que valent les donjons hl mais à priori c'est assez compliqué de le savoir au vu de la recherche de groupe. 

Pour conclure, ce jeu est un ersatz de Lineage II, avec pas mal de points positifs qui peuvent mériter de valoir le détour. Malheureusement on reste vraiment sur sa faim à l'heure actuelle. On aimerait ne pas avoir cette amertume derrière chaque concept. Au vu de la réactivité de Neowizz ont peut espérer une écoute et des améliorations mais pour l'instant mon avis restera négatifs car finallement j'ai presque plus eu l'impression de travailler que de m'amuser... J'ai cependant voyagé.

0,12,1,7519,7519,76561198038424765,0,english,False,42562327,"I first saw a video of Bless several years ago, alongside with Black Desert by that time and thought both games would come around at the same time, and i admit, Bless gave me the better ""feeling"" by that time.
Graphics seemed smoother and it was quite nice. 
 
But Black Desert went online a few years earlier and surprised me with so many things to do and a surprisingly nice graphics.
And now, finally, Bless is here too and i gave it a try last weekend.
I had many expectations regarding Bless Online, Triple-A-Next-Gen-MMO with innovative gameplay design and new ideas, groundbreaking graphics and so on, and in that term I got really disappointed, or let's say i'd rather be disappointed if that was all.
But, surprisingly for me, I had a very enjoyable weekend in the game, despite the lack of most of that, or is it BECAUSE of that?
You may hate me for that, but my personal impression is that Bless reminds me a lot of Runes of Magic, the graphics is way better, RoM has its 9th anniversary i think and i haven't played it for years….but let’s ee.
Bless follows a simple path, interfaces for Crafting are not that beautiful, but kept simple and not much confusing when you get familiar with.
You have lots of items, but not that thousands you know from Archeage or BDO. You can easily get an overview in short time.
The environment is nice, but not that much overloaded like BDO. Just look at BDO and Bless, and see the difference. The zones and spots are nice and you have a good view, nothing too crowded.
I feel comfortable in Bless, it kinda gives a good feeling, and the weekend was really fun.
I cannot judge endgame content, as i only reached lvl 22 and i am happy with that, i'm not in a hurry to get to max lvl soon, i enjoy the path, and i like to follow and listen to the storyline.
What i don't like is the limitation on crafting, as i understand you can't trade many items and you can only get one major craft profession. You can expect more of new game nowadays!
So you want armorsmithing  and just do it, but then you notice you need taming scrolls and only the enchanter can craft them you need to check auction house and make an alt on same account. 
Another annoying aspect is the poor marketplace/auction house. I doubt i've seen such a bad thing in years. They opted for a web based auction house that many times does not even open or does not react on any
input given, that may be corrected in time, but i don't like it at all, its ugly^^ and well, if you consider, that the game is released in Korea and Japan, is it that difficult to make a working marketplace?
I really have no words I can use for that. It’s simply annoying, but you may like it, maybe it is just a matter of bad taste on my side.
 
The taming aspect is really nice, and enchanting, until now, seems pretty straight forward, but maybe hard to get materials.....if not buying from Lumena shop.
So there is one major problem for me.
I paid 30 Euros just to get ingame, when other Games like TERA, Archeage etc. are free to enter, BDO costs 10 Euros for the base version and seem to offer way more for the money.
From a developer's point of view this is still cheap, considering all the efforts and money you spent over the past years. But from a players point of view, there are other games with lower entries.
AND i doubt that this is all we will see in terms of pricing.
When you see items like ""obtained in Lumena shop"" you can ask if this game is really B2P or is it rather ""B2P and P2W if you want the real stuff"".
My first pet needed 8 tries to get the first upgrade and has 2 upgrade tries remaining, with a base chance of 15%.
BUT there are items you can use to enhance your chance...well, obtainable in Lumena shop.
Maybe the text is wrong and you can get it ingame in dungeons or otherwise later, but that gives a bad taste.
 
A look at the Lumena shop shows some useful items, mostly for taming/pet/ upgrading and enchanting/gear crafting, this is NOT only cosmetics.
 
For me, the gameplay and progression is enjoyable, the first dungeon was quite fun, i tried the dungeon/party finder, but did not get a party, no idea
if the tool does not work, or if i was not patient enough (I registered for lvl 14 and for lvl 22 dungeon, but never got a party through the tool), so i decided to go in solo, and it was doable, but was challenging, so i liked it.
I have no idea about endgame content but to be honest i doubt, that Bless has so much to offer right now, besides a nice storyline, nice graphics, and an oldschool MMO with some endgame dungeon(s).
 
What reminds me of RoM is partly the nice music, the zones, the idea of some elite monsters here and there, the simple UI and straight forward enchanting and so on and
the part where I noticed I got a little bit addicted to it last weekend…just one more quest, just one more pet taming…just get one more resource….
 
I think Bless is not enjoyable despite of lacking sandbox elements and huge varieties of content like other games offer, but just because of that.
Its kinda old school MMO. It is nice, beautiful, nothing groundbreaking, but nothing game breaking either, nothing too complicated and confusing, but rather straight forward. 
The pet/mount taming is nice and i believe we will see more content like housing later (maybe it is already there, but i don't know^^).
 
As for fun and good feeling, i think this game has potential to get addicted to, at least for a while. If it is a game you’ll still play in 6 months...i am not sure.
So, if you liked RoM and old school MMOs, and want it with new, really nice graphics, nothing too weird and nothing too complicated, than i think you're fine with BLESS.
If you look for another Archeage or BDO you may wait and see how or even if, Bless will envolve in that direction.
 
As for the technical part.
I chose german language in the launcher for the game, but almost everything is in english, but hey, we're in first week of release/early access, so i don't mind, and the english is fine for me.
Dialogues are in english, video sequences are in english (with german subtitles) and interface seems to be mostly in english, but at least it seems all fine and that may be updated in the near future.
For now, all quests worked for me, some i had to restart, and some tutorial do not show as ""done"", but no problem.
I had no game crashes, no connection problems, and cannot complain about performance problems, but maybe they fixed most of it already.
 
So, in the end, it is not what I expected and what I was waiting for all the years, but it gives quite a bit of fun and is worth (for me) to give it a try and see what comes next and how endgame will evolve.
 
I am very curious about the number of players online on the servers, as I noticed a very low population in the lvl 10-20 zones the last days, compared to TERA or BDO it looks rather deserted, so any idea how many players are actually playing/logging in ?",True,1528400798,1528400798,True,0,4,0.529412,True

That being said, what we have is a game which is being polished with open-minded developers who are updating the game on a near-daily basis, and have direct communication with players.

The combat system is intriguing, and while based on traditional tab-targeting, is heavily combo-based requiring planning and timing. PVE is open world with themepark elements like instanced dungeons and world bosses. PVP is faction-based and open world as well as instanced, with territory wars coming in the future.

There's a ton of crafting, and life-skilling too.

Did I mention that nearly every mob can be a mount or a pet? How about gear disparity not being punishing or pay2win?

There's a lot here, and lot more to come. I look to this one optimistically. While perhaps the less eager might do well to wait for more progress, this is by no means an incomplete or unworthy project.

I don't plan to rush anything, because of how huge the world is and how there's ton of things to do that don't revolve around main quests like people cater to think.

So I've got a bucket list of things to do, some related to taming like finding a really good pet that has a really good ability like EXP or finding a really good mount that has a speed ability. These are precious gems, they don't take 5 minutes to find. 
Sure, you can have 35 mounts in 15 minutes; none of them will be good though. 

You can get your 37 blue gear and call it a day, or you can keep going for the proper socket slot for your gear, get that and then go chase the godly level 45 purple gear.

There's more than enough content for just 30 bucks, shut up about Early Access. I don't care if the game was released 17 times in the past 3 years in 63 different countries - if it can bring me joy and I can constantly play it without being bored; it's good enough for me.

Optimization is not that big of a deal after a quick .ini fix, I'm getting solid frames - the main fps killer is Shadows in this game, yet they're so beautiful :(

A Terrible launch state (Poor Optimization, no endgame, Stupid balance decisions, broken promises) has understandably angered Bless's initial investors, with a good proportion deciding to refund the game in the first week. Bless's reputation has been permanently ruined, and the negative press surrounding the game will deter additional people investing the time/money into a ""flawed"" game. This will stagnate the player base relatively quickly, and with it, the death of the game.

I predict Bless will release as a free to play game following its early access period (in 6 - 12 months’ time) in order to renew interest in Bless and bumping up the population. If by then the developers can fix its numerous issues, then who knows, it could rise from the ashes and succeed but right now I cannot recommend, hold on to your money and invest your time into one of the vast selection of already polished MMOs already out there.

Servers we're locked during launch and a lot people are separated from their guilds/friends and there is no planned character transfer announced in near future (and if there will be, im pretty scared that it's €€€€ only). There is currently only 1 server in EU (locked one at launch) that actually has the amount of players that i wouldn't call it as dead server, and yeah its 1 week from launch. 

So basically they closed the only server worth putting any time in to and forced us to the RU/DE/FR speaking servers without any population. (I did count 7 people in main city last night, while there was 50-100 people on server Physis.

Leveling experience is so selfrepeating and mind numbing, that if you made an mistake and leveled up in another server because of server lock, you definetly don't wanna repeat that process again and level up 2nd character in another server, just to save couple days of your life and your mental health. 

Most likely missing all of it's endgame content. We got patch, 15v15 bg (you only can queue specific timeframes 3x 1 hour per day, and on dead server you have to be very lucky to get queue pop before timeframe closes. (Basically you get 3 battlegrounds in a day, if you want to put alarm for all those 3 timewindows when queue is possible and get in to bg before it closes) 
It got ruined day after by placing ONE SHOTTING PVE mobs in there, and all your runes in your gear break if you die in pve, so.... WHO THE F GOT THE IDEA TO DO SO.

Item duplication bug at launch (they told the duped items are removed) we have a lot of proof those aren't. Currently a bug where you can do insane amounts of money just by running a circle and pressing 1 button.

Anyways, dev's have been trying hard and been giving us a lot ""fix"" patches during the first week from launch. Apparently those seems most likely to be randomly tweaked parameters and completely untested before pushing those to official servers. Some of those been good, some of those changes mess up the game even more.

From many places I hear; ""all those negative reviews are from players under 2 hours in game, they can't tell truth and just want to bash the game"";
I took 1 week, put in 100 hours, and i don't see any wrong in those negative reviews. Some people just recognize a cash grab/TOO broken game faster than the others.

Refundtrain is far gone already, so don't take risk.

Outros MMO como Tera foram feitos no mesmo motor grafico e tem as mesmas dificuldades que o Bless de entregar uma jogabilidade estável e moderna.
Mesmo diante das conhecidas dificuldades, a desenvolvedora decidiu fazer promessas grandiosas, como trazer uma jogabilidade boa, server unico PvE, combate fluído, etc, e falhou diante destas promessas.
Claro que há players que estão engajados, mas em minha opinião isso se deve mais pela escassez de jogos modernos, com comunidade saudável e sem mecanicas Pay-To-Win.

Before getting the game I had a look on youtube and other sites for reviews, they haven't been good, but I think nowadays people just like pvp and always want something new and different.

Community is helpful, the combat isn't difficult to get used to and the story line is still interesting to follow.

Não, você não irá enfrentar fila alguma, teve esse problema em seus primeiros dia de lançamento mas que logo foi solucionado.

Que o jogo está mal otimizado já não é segredo pra ninguém. A queda de FPS acontece principalmente na cidade principal e qdo você muda de região.

And I'm doing it because I'm pissed off. Not at Bless particularly. But at the community as a whole. Do people forget launches such as SWTOR? or The Burning Crusade? Matrix online anyone? There have been COUNTLESS worse mmo launches. And quite honestly people are lazy. The MMO community has become such spoiled brats (we used to slog through UO and Everquest for god sakes). Was the launch a mess? Absolutely. Are people too lazy to fix things a bit. Literally copy and paste 3 and change 1 word  to fix all framerate issues. 3 .ini files and an open GL fix. Literally 2 min and people can't do it. Its easier than installing from a DVD for christ sakes. The MMO community as a whole has become lazy, spoiled. (LOOKING AT YOU PEON). Like your stuff but you did this game an injustice. MMO gamers used to be the best ones. Ones willing to put in time, not afraid of a challenge, and generally the most tech minded. But that has changed. I like Bless. For all its flaws. The launch has felt like your apart of something BIG IMO. Weather that is good or bad its felt BIG. I'd like the MMO community, Especially us old timers to try to remember all the launches we've been through, and even though frustrating some times they are always fun. And I'd like the people who make COMPLETELY uninformed posts and reviews like telling people there is no end game so don't bother. (its coming in 2 weeks like really). I'd like those people to stick to fortnite honestly and stop ruining shit for the rest of us making devs not even want to produce an MMO. Would you want to deal with this community? I'm disappointed. Good or bad Bless is fun IMO as are most hyped MMOs just to be a part of the hype and the launch is worth the $40 for me. Everyone is entitled to there own opinion, but at least make sure they are not misleading. I feel sorry for the Devs honestly. It was there first time self publishing and the community and a lot thanks to Peon has branded this game unfairly and given NO time to fix things. They are listening. Doing what we ask. Things have changed. And its disappointing to see how it has. Both with the community, and publishers and all this cashshop bullshit across the whole medium we love.

The more I spend time on this game the more I actually feel embarassed by blatent bugs, exploits and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and balance decisions who should not be in any MMORPGs released in 2018 (especially when you get to know the exact same bugs and glitches were present in the previous versions of this game). 

The lastest one I read about and had to go check with my own eyes is this Chili location near the Mascu starting area on this zone which should not be able to be ingame yet so its like a dead-zone but there are resources on that place. Guess what? LOTS of Chili. You gather them and you sell them to npcs. The top guilds on this game have been exploiting both channels on this game. This bug was present on the other versions of the game too and they dont care about it at all. So right now thats at least the blatent dupe mechanic everybody knew about and now this Chili place everybody started to exploit. I mean I look at this place crowded of people now and I question myself why the ♥♥♥♥ would I just not do the same? Is this really an exploit? Of course ITS NOT ANYBODY CAN ENTER IN THIS DUMB AREA AND COLLECT THE CHILI TO SELL TO NPCs. 

Its just gamebreaking mechanics that are left there so hardcore players, friends of developers and whatever else get to abuse it for a couple of days, weeks until they nerf it to the ground. Do you think its normal that a game gets released and like 4-5 days after its release there is a 75% reduction on overall exp gain? There's only two justifications for this: 1) There was no QA testing whatsoever prior to the game being released or 2) It was all intended so certain players would take advantage of the initial rush. I truly want to just believe its the first case but the more I get to play the game the more I find it hard to believe they can be so damn incompetent repeatedly.

I am absolutely addicted to MMORPGs and the skeleton and mechanics of this game are indeed fun. In theory they seem actually engaging if you are into MMORPG's like myself who has been into Guild PvP stuff in games like Dark Age of Camelot, Warhammer Online etc. But the more you delve into it and get to know about absurd gamebreaking, asian RNG stupidity, time-gated battleground which it takes you 20-30 minutes to join a battleground that lasts only for 1 ♥♥♥♥♥ hour three times a day, stunlocking stupidities, and neverending glitches that are just 'ported' from one version to another with the justification of this being 'Early Access' and its Enraged Whiteknights defending this pathetic argument its outrageous to say the very least. 

I am not in need of a refund. I don't whine about $40 and I have paid alot more for worse games than this and still do especially in cosmetics. Money is not the issue but the lack of real transparency is just pathetic. Its like you are dating a russian golddigger, you know she just wants to get to know about your belongings and that you pay the bill after you are done eating but you dont give a damn even if in the end you are just being played. 

I really could make a nice list here of all the exploits, broken mechanics, broken battleground queues bugs, broken battleground monsters. 

That's only in the 120-130 hours I have played. Now imagine all these real hardcore players who tried the game on the other versions. Unless you are playing this for the 'ride' which you could do the same on a game like Wartune (and its ride is objectively more fun and honestly more balanced even with its outrageous pay to win features and a proper auto-path feature).

I mean if I wanted to be really negative there is a gigantic pool of blackhole bulbus stercum these developers were able to produce that I don't get amazed anymore with their changes/fixes, false news about action combat or non-sense mechanics

The studio doesn't even seems to know where they are going. Third release and still no idea.
Awfull coommunication, when you doesn't even try to explain what you are trying ""to test"", without a clear way to report bugs, to give some point of view, something is some kind of way pretty wrong.
When you are told you are helping into a beta,  and feel like this thing was released because of a stop date...

Even after hours of playing, didn't found any good point to save.
Too many point this games feels 15years late.

Many bugs into the game core, (can't use skills, loading texture allowing to fall through the floor). 
graphics using lot of ressources for pretty poor results.
Seems they removed many things just to fake a path to level up (many places, as mountain are just 100% empty), the path finders trying to make you go through oppsite faction camps....


being stuck ? use the emergency reset option to be teleported pretty far away.
you need a emote ? ask other players  if they have been found or russian/japanese players took some notes.
Assassin not available to play ? you can still drop their stuff.
Need to test stats impact ? hide / remove dummies to let people make tests. (military districts).
trying to be a pvp game ? do not give objectives as dueling an other class of your level when they have the reverse challenge? (there is a win a duel challenge but, feels weird) will people just agree to loose ? will people have to try to challenge unbalanced duels ? it feels so .... 
you don't know where you are leading the game ? make what you can to be sure people won't enjoy the experience.
right now the game is a kill things to level up, and be an harrasment for any lower opponant you find, better if you can outnumber them. ( did it, when anger take the leads you do bad things, and you feels dirty, making other not enjoying a chance to do something make you get any kind of self satisfaction, my bad i didn't, sorry i guess i'm not enough a jerk.
Maybe this part will be fixed when there will be many bus of high levels of each factions scouting roads. but if i like to imagine that things can self fix, i have a doubt.



The pvp the ""purpose"" sold of this game is just .... a shame. never played a so static game who was trying to be : ""dynamic""
not a good tab targeting, not a good pure action, just the worst of the 2 worlds, a pain to target and not reactive for action.
You want to pvp ? why not using the battle zone ? everyone will be set lvl 45 but don't unlock the lvl 45 skills if you are not lvl 45, because it could balance things ?

The UI is just a ... shame ? dishonor to everything that have been done in other games ? 
just being able to see if your team mate are around you have to choose to show up health above players and just ""try"" to heal the hard way.
No stamina shown (sprint), dodge action making guardian/paladin even more static, you'll feel more like a aoe dodge denying class.
Remainming stance switch class should be even smaller.
Population on servers doesn't seems balanced at all, almost feeling like 1/10 or more (and people can't create your side, good luck to explain the difference between created characters / played characters)

Been told that the founders pack are up for a single character ! Rolling on floor .... so people shouldn't even try multiples classes. be ready to pay for anything, and you still have too much cash there will be cosmetics.


Some very important features are CASH SHOP ! Tactics are just more than confort .... but you have to pay for every characters ! need inventory expansion ? need any confort ? you'll pay for cosmetics later ! enjoy our way to makes you learn you credit card number .... (the feeling of the game right now)

You used the dungeon team searching tool and got a group ? pay for dungeon teleportation ! 75 lumena ! every time, you can in game farm 50 lumena per day with an inside mecanics .... for an insane amount.
So you pay the game, you can pay and month fee, and you still have to pay even more for anything .... Electronic Arts .... is that you ? 

As not even getting closer to all troubles, you exit a dungeon you'll be set to the channel 1 in front of the entrance, 2 choices, your faction is outnumbering the place, you have to use a pvp disable item, anyway, even if you use a crowd control immunity to try to run back in (2m) you'll be killed because it is just more fun this way.
I like pvp but when you are pushed to hunt for anyting lower than you there is only shame in the player vs player spirit, the adrenaline rush, the ""i can do it"", no it is just a bus tour stomping tourists.

You'll try to answer it is a beta ? not a beta, it doesn't worth some fixes. The main matter is that there is no objective to reach for the devs, like a frankenstein creature, patched with things saw elsewhere not giving the feeling they are mastered.

As a part of the game have been removed, let's say for a better sight on tests, the lore is just the too many time seen thing,
the level design is... still trying to understand what could had been the purpose, not a pve mapping, not a real pvp strategy with key places to control, except maybe dungeons.
the race choice have some result on party buff available ( when teaming you can set buffs, the availables ones are a matter of races / classes in the group ), but to be direct, never felt that races were just so useless..... not even charimatics, some game doesn't have any ""race buff"" but you still feels like being part of something.... in this case .... it is just.. a single race any of the current available one would be enough.....
The story doesn't care ? there is some not bad attempt, but... messia syndrom without any impact feeling.
Sad to say but the main story arc is the closest thing to leveling pointing path. 
All making leveling a fast but .... so boring thing. And you don't even have to hope it will be building you mastering of your class ....

The economy model is strange, so much control on the auction house, consumables are just very expensives to craft. So afraid of gold farmers that is just feels locked in padlock bunch without ideas of consequences. 
The auction house doesn't have any stat filter, good luck finding things that you could be trying to fit for your class.
People doesn't want to rise a crafting skill ? at least they can collect ressources and sell them, but in the end consumable are pretty expensive (potions can be very usefulls, they are quite insane powerfull, but it costs 2 kidney to keep a good stock up if not alchemist, spirits are very very very powerfull upgrades but you may loose them on death, so you should stack plenty .... be ready to spend a lot of money.)

The last and one that can change the most in next days might be the gameplay, started with a dynamic but 2 shots fights endgame, to a static annoying game not planned to be very pve proof. 
Here the matter is that is just insane strong, unexpected and might had need more explanations, (come on some dungeons were almost not possible to do, because people didn't knew how to take the path the devs wanted to try !). For that point i have a doubt about that dev team having a planned strategy.... 

Some huge matters have been solved, such has not having a true multiple attempt to connect, with a result of static screan, without any idea of what is happening. 
Some unbalanced skills have been fixed. 
But so much remain.


Last words, i hope, that many things will be fixed some way, that bless online won't be remebered as a full failure (3rd release attempt !! and still no idea about what it should try to be ?).
Not because i believe bless online could be a great game, but because it feels like people could be less enthusiastic in futur games.

En primer lugar, destacar que, aunque sea un early acces, el juego lleva muchos años ya en desarrollo y ya ha estado en asia, donde el juego funciona bien. Esto viene ligado a que está MUY mal optimizado a fecha de este análisis, si tienes un PC que no sea gama media-alta, olvídate.

Dejando de lado el tema técnico, jugablemente es... sorprendente; al princiipio estaba algo escéptico con el título, me parecía algo extraño y con un control un poco raro. Pero una vez te haces al movimiento y el combate, resulta ser una experiencia sorprendentemente divertida, uno de los muy pocos mmo que he jugado (que no son pocos) en el que no me canso de pelear ni siquiera contra mobs. El sistema de skills y combos está bastante bien pensado.

Ahora mismo, el endgame es algo ""escaso"", puedes hacer PvP open world, las arenas 15vs15 abren a ciertas horas del día.
Hay varias profesiones a las que dedicarse, las cuales me gustan por el hecho de ser muy sencillas, sin pretensiones ni mecánicas inentendibles, solo recoger material y craftear con él.

Parece que aunque están haciendo algunas cagadas con las actualizaciones, se están portando. Se nota que escuchan el feedback de la comunidad y hacedme caso, en un juego de este género eso es oro puro.

Vamos con lo que pregunta tooooodo el mundo, el P2W (Pay to Win): No hay mucho que decir ¿es P2W?, no realmente, hay cosicas que comprar en la Store, por Lumenas (que así se llaman las monedas premium) pero ninguna es realmente determinante para ser mejor que cualquier otro jugador.
También hay un sistema de Premium mensual, esto da exp, baja precios al reparar etc, es un boost por si quieres pagar los 13€ que vale, pero si no quieres, desde luego podrás seguir jugando tranquilamente.

Conclusiones:

Es un mmo realmente normalito, no reinventa mucho aparte de un poco el combate, fusionando clásico con moderno.
No destaca por sus gráficos, su sonido o su gran gran contenido, pero ¿sabéis qué?. Me lo estoy pasando en grande.

-As it they weren't clear on what features were going to be in this game at the start or limitations on character pergression. An with how bugy or broken some much of the current content is in the game is just frustrating to play at times. 
-Currently it is impossible to do the max lvl dungeon because mob HP and player damage scaling is terrible and the boss will enter enrage mode before you can get them down to 50% hp. 
-The lvl 37 dungeon isn't dropping the item required to craft lvl 37 gear which is the current BIS gear sense max lvl dungeon are impossible to do so were currently stuck with half lvl 31 gear half lvl 37 gear for BIS until this is fixed. 
-The combat system is poorly balanced and feels like an early alpha with some classes getting all the CCs, multiply CC brakes, tons of def skills, and mobility skills, while others get zero CC, zero CC brakes, zero defensive skills, have huge 30-90s CD on all their skills and are literal just punching bags for the other classes. Overall the combat feels like a very early alpha in regards to balance.
-An worst of all the developer isn't communitcating with the player base at all they don't tell us their fixing something or how it being fix until after its fixed.

Though addressed now, the duping bug was in for several days and caused a lot of problems. My issue with this is that this was something in the previous versions of the game and was not fixed prior to launch. This tells me the developers are either lazy or incompetent. 

The combat currently is ok but unfinished. They clearly needed several more months of tweeking to get the combat to a fun and 'rhythmic' point. I play as a guardian (level 45) and don't feel like a tank at all. I specced everything I had into the two tanking trees and can't hold AOE aggro and barely hold single target aggro. 

The UI needs a lot of work and the optimization is not there yet. 

While I currently cannot reccomend the game, I do believe that if the developers resolve a lot of the communities complaints they might be able to to turn it around.

El juego actualmente se encuentra en Acceso anticipado y tiene aún muchos bugs y una pésima optimización, si bien, uno pensaría que esto es normal en un juego nuevo, pero en este caso no es así, me sorprende que este juego tenga esta clase de errores porque éste tiene más de 9 años de desarrollo, por lo que no debería de presentar esta clase de problemas.

Con esto nos podemos dar cuenta que los desarrolladores no tuvieron ni la más mínima intención de corregir los errores que se estaban presentando, ya que estos mismos errores los tuvieron en los servidores de Asia y no hicieron nada para solucionarlo desde su salida en NA y EU.

Con todos estos errores y fallas de parte de la Empresa, podemos decir que la idea no es mala, si bien le hace falta mucho para ser un gran juego pero que poco a poco los desarrolladores lo van a ir actualizando. Otro punto extra es, en el que si están escuchando a la comunidad y hasta el momento estan teniendo constantes actualizaciones.

La razón por la cual yo recomiendo el juego es muy simple, sin tanto rollo ni tapujos, me recuerda mucho a los MMO de antes, a los que me jugaba por ahí del 2005 y 2006, a lo oldschool. Pero no todo está bien en este juego, ya que a mi parecer el sistema de combate lo veo muy simple y tosco, los movimientos de cada uno de los personajes es muy lento y que en pleno año 2018 esto debería de ser totalmente diferente.

Gra wymaga optymalizacji plików gry od strony gracza, co już jest kardynarne - inaczej się nie da grać, a to dopiero wierzchołek góry lodowej. Gra nie tylko się tnie niemiłosiernie w stolicach, ale lubi do tego raz na jakiś czas wywalić się do Windowsa lub spowodować niewyjaśniony disconect.

A wiecie co jest najgorsze? Że gra mi się bardzo miło, ale przez złą optymalizację po prostu szkoda mi nerwów. Po optymalizacji plików i zmniejszeniu grafiki na średni, gra dalej lubi się przyciąć, a do tego wygląda strasznie brzydko. System walki akceptowalny, ale raczej monotonny, to samo game flow - robimy questy polegające głównie na zbieraniu rzeczy i zabijaniu mobów.

-promised features missing
-collectors edition is a joke. After 30/60/90 days everything is disappearing because its only time bound. Also all the stuff can only activated on ONE character. not acceptable for price tag of a AAA title.
-game devs have no idea of balancing, every patch coming out makes things worse.
-nothing real to do after hitting 45.
-high level Dungeons are highly bugged and not adjusted to the current dmg and gear levels of players. Every boss feels like a raidboss.
-no gear dropping by bosses in dungeons past 43.
-fight system with action compbat only applies for Berserker class.

Spent the first few hours of the game being disconnected, stuck in the BLESS intro screen, constant disconnections, as well as server maintenance every few hours. (Maintenece I didn't mind as much, as at least they were trying to resolve some problems) I tried playing as a Paladin and Berserker, both every different play styles, but yet I could not enjoy the little play time I managed to get due to again many disconnections. This of course began to irritate me, after all I did spend nearly $70 on what I expected to be a finished game, as they should have learn't from three failures. I was apart of a community at the time that decided to give BLESS a go, and with many of my guildies beginning to reach max level, the complaining began. There was no 'real' end game material. The classes where buggy/not balanced, the PVP was bad, people where about to instant spawn with real cash currency...the list just goes on. I had enough. It wasn't worth the money I paid. I wanted a refund. Some of my guildies requested a refund, and it was granted, even though they where way over the 2 hour gamplay policy steam has. I wrote to steam requesting for a refund due to the problems I have stated above, to only be sent a automated response TWICE that I had exceded the 2 hours of game play rule. I was not happy. I wrote to steam again, asking them to explain to me how they can justify that it was playtime when it I was stuck in title screens, to only be sent the same auto response again. I then found out that it was only for 2 days that they were accepting FULL REFUNDS for the game, which of course is just so bad. But I still couldn't get a refund. I then tried my luck to conntact Neowiz explaining that the 2 hours of gameplay where actually stuck in title screens, (which was a well known problem) constant disconnects ect and they told me that they DO NOT deal with refunds, to contact steam.... At this moment in time there is nothing more I can do and I am so dissapointed in Steam and in Neowiz for releasing a game that was no where near finished for the price they charged.

Grüße dies ist mein erstes Review, ich schreibe es um den ganzen Bewertungen entgegenzuwirken, welche nach nicht einmal 3 Stunden Spielzeit oder in den ersten Tagen entstanden sind, also das Spiel noch unspielbar war.

Ich erlebte auch den zweiten Tag des Headstarts und weis das es sehr kritisch war. Laggs, Dc's und man kam nur selten über den Startbildschirm hinaus. Jedoch wurde dies alles behoben.
Mittlerweile gehe ich stark auf die 100 Stunden Spielzeit zu.

Seit dem gab es keinen Tag an dem es kein neues Update gab.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]

Das Kampfsystem finde ich persönlich sehr gut, sowohl als Berserker, Magier, Ranger und als mein main Guardian, leider fehlt noch das Action Kampfsystem, dass wäre noch das i Tüpfelchen. (Berserker besitzt Action cam bereits)
Es macht spaß mit den verschiedenen Haltungen rumzuprobieren um seinen eigenen Stil zu finden. Das Kämpfen ist anspruchsvoll und ich liebe es. Hoffentlich bleibt es anspruchsvoll!
Die Dungeons sind herausfordernd, hier freue ich mich schon auf die Raid Instanz und weiteren Inhalt.
Das Questen ist im Prinzip wie in jedem anderen MMORPG, laufe dorthin, töte diese Viecher, bring mir deren Blut und sammel Eier von den Adlern.

Das Crafting weis zu überzeugen, ich verbringe sehr viel Zeit damit Bufffood/ Rüstungen/ Taming Scrolls und so weiter herzustellen. Wobei die Ressourcenbeschaffung etwas zu einfach ist, wegen den dazugehörigen Dungeons. ;)
Wiederrum andere Ressourcen wie Fleisch bekommt man so selten... das ich garnicht weis wie und wo ich das sammeln soll.

PvP habe ich persönlich noch keine große Erfahrung, würde es aber nacheditieren wenn es soweit ist. Balancing ist aber bisher ""okay"", habe schon wesentlich schlimmeres gesehen. Einige Klassen haben im Vergleich zu anderen wesentlich weniger Mobilität, das scheint aktuell in meinen Augen das Hauptproblem zu sein.

[b]Story:[/b]

Für ein MMO ganz in Ordnung. (Union Seite)
Jedoch hätte man auch hier mehr draus machen können. Habe bisher aber nur die Mainstory verfolgt. Desweiteren mag ich aber nicht die englische Sprachausgabe, weshalb ich sie mit der japanischen ersetzt habe. (Siehe Google bei Interesse)

[b]Performance:[/b]

Persönlich habe ich hier, im Vergleich zu einigen anderen keine Probleme. Die Ini Tweaks (nutzt google) brachten noch einige FPS mehr, so bin ich bei 70-140 FPS und in Städten unter vielen Spielern bei ~40 FPS.
Die Engine und DX9 machen es nicht optimal, aber es ist in Ordnung. Die FPS in den Städten könnte besser sein.

Die Server sind stabil, keine Verbindungsabbrüche oder lags.

i7 8700k @ 4,8 Ghz all core
Gtx 980ti
Win 10
16 GB RAM
Alte SSD von Crucial

[b]Content:[/b]
Natürlich ist hier noch nicht viel da! Es gibt trotzdessen jede Menge zu tun. Die hohen Instanzen, PvP, Battleground, Crafting und Taming.
Letztes spielt ebenfalls eine wichtige Rolle, weil man sehr hilfreiche Buffs erhalten kann!

[b]Ingame-Shop:[/b]
Bisher alles gut wie es ist, kein P2W oder ähnliches. Ich hätte schon längst erwartet das es neue Kostüme oder ähnliches gibt um mehr Geld zu machen, jedoch scheint die priorität des Entwicklers aktuell woanders zu liegen und das sagt schon vieles aus!

[b]Was wünschenswert wäre:[/b]
[list]
[*]Lokalisierung
[*]Performance verbesserung
[*]Action Cam
[*]mehr Einstellungsmöglichkeiten des Interfaces
[/list]

[b]Fazit:[/b]
Ich bin kein Fanboy, aber ich finde die Bewertung von Bless Online auf Steam einfach ungerechtfertigt. Die meisten sind einfach negativ an das Spiel herangegangen und haben viel zu voreilig Schlüsse gezogen. Das Spiel hat eine bessere Bewertung verdient, besonders wenn die Entwickler weiterhin das Spiel mit Updates versorgen!

Sicherlich ist das Spiel aktuell kein Rundum-sorglos-Paket. Es ist im Early Access, die Entwickler hatten vorher 6 Monate Zeit es für uns anzupassen. Haben vieles gezeigt und mit dem fehlenden Action Cam System geworben.
Aber sie bemühen sich definitiv, ich erinnere mich an Spiele die grottenschlecht liefen und die Entwickler haben ewig nichts daran geändert, stattdessen neue Outfits in den Ingameshop eingestellt. Trotzdessen hatten diese Spiele eine bessere Bewertung als Bless!

Desweiteren ist das Spiel so schlecht bewertet weil, die Leute die es mögen, es lieber spielen als es hier zu bewerten.
[u]Mir macht das Spiel sehr viel Spaß, es hat sehr viel potential. Seit langem ein MMO was mich fesselt.[/u]

If Steam allowed a 'Maybe' rating instead of recommend/not recommend I would have chosen that. Bless doesn't excel in any area - graphics are OK but dated, story is dull but thankfully most cutscenes can be skipped. 

Combat initially seems unique but is basically a hybrid of standard mmo tab-target and hotkeys, and a smaller ability set. One of three basic abilities each branch off to three more, and switching 'stances' allows one to change specs on the fly, which actually is pretty cool.

Taming is also a very nice component as one can tame pretty much any mob one encounters - which means scorpion mounts, ghost pets and tons of others.

Other than that the MMO components  are standard (fetch stuff, kill stuff etc) with a linear story quest moving through the different zones. Crafting and gathering seem standard but nothing to complain about. 

Optimisation of graphics is terrible, resulting in low frame rates even for my reasonably beefy PC. The tweaks to the game's INI file here - 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bless/comments/8mt3yq/bless_graphics_ini_tweak_guide/

improved things quite a bit for me, but having to fiddle with a text file to get a game to work properly is obviously not ideal.

There is nothing new or outstanding here apart from the taming system, but if you are looking for a new MMO to pass the time like I was, then for the price of the basic game I give this a hesitant thumbs up. Wait for a sale though, and don't buy the Founder's packs - they are a ripoff.",True,1528281222,1528302528,True,0,3,0.521739,True

nach einigen Startschwierigkeiten die sich mehr oder weniger gelegt hatten, hab ich mich in das Abenteuer Bless-Online gestürzt.
Anfangs läuft es auch recht gut und locker und man erreicht die ersten Erfolge und die Motivationskurze bleibt bestehen. Lustige Gimmmicks wie das zähmen von Reittieren und Pets ist auch eine recht lustige Sache die den Sammlertrieb nach vorne peitscht :)
Also weiterhin fleissig am erledigen der Haupt- sowie der Nebenquests gewesen, nebenbei auch die Dungeons besucht die einem eröffnet wurden und weiterhin Spass gehabt in der Bless-Welt erkundend durch die Gegenden zu laufen.

Bis.....
...leider kam dann der frustrierende Part.
Beim verfolgen der Main-Quest kam ich in ein Gebiet, welches mir das erste mal aufzeigte, dass ich nicht nur NPC's als Gegner habe sondern auch echte Spieler.
Was gerade etwas nervig war als man mitten in einem getümmel voller Pumas stand und versuchte zu überleben und als man auch diese Herausforderung gemeistert hatte, mit nur noch einem Hauch von Lebensbalken, flogen einem auch schon die Pfeile eines Rangers umher und man lag im Dreck. Gefolgt von ein paar ""netten"" Worten als er neben meinem Char freudig herumsprang.

Naja, kann passieren dachte ich mir .. also weiter und versucht meine Main-Quest fortzusetzen.
Freudig erblicke ich das blaue Wappen über dem NPC aus ein paar Metern Entfernung als plötzlich ein Mob aus 8 Spielern etwa einfach über mich drüber bügelt.
Hmm...schwierig...was war denn das, dachte ich mir.
Also wieder ab zum Erwecker meines Vertrauens und mache mich erneut auf den Weg zum Quest-Geber....und wie ""leider erhofft"", kam der Zug erneut vorbei und überfuhr mich erneut.

Das ging dann noch einige Male so bis die Lust, meinen Character auf das Endlevel zu bringen und weiterhin die Bless-Online Welt zu erforschen in den Keller gewandert sind.
Ja, man könnte auch diese tollen Imunitäts-Rollen nutzen, die einen für 10 Minuten mal unantastbar machen aber dann bräuchte ich für meinen Teil ja locker 20 Rollen am Tag etwa.

Für mich hat sich es leider erledigt an dieser Stelle denn wenn ich PVP spielen mag, dann geh ich in die Zone oder den Battleground auf dem ich mich austoben kann. Aber sich ""abfarmen"" zu lassen nur weil man seine Storyline zu Ende bringen mag.

Sollten sie etwas an dem Konzept ändern dann würde ich es mir nochmals anschauen denn wie gesagt, bis zu dem Zeitpunkt hat es wirklich Spass gemacht und man hat über die kleinen technischen Mängel drüber geschaut.

Aus dem Grund empfehle ich das Spiel nicht, einfach aufgrund meiner eigenen Sicht.

Viele Falschaussagen kursieren leider in der gegend was Bless Online angeht. Menschen die das Spiel nichtmal bis zum Endcontent gespielt haben bashen das Game, viele Youtuber springen auf diesen Zug auf um Zuschauer zu generieren.
Ich finde es schade das sich Heute viele kein eigenes Bild machen sondern sich so manipulieren lassen.

Ich hab schon öfters gehört das das Game schon 9 Jahre alt ist, 2014 wurde es in Korea in die CBT gebracht. 2 Jahre sind ca der normale zeitraum in der ein Asia MMO den Westen erreicht, Bless hatte jedoch Rückschläge und einen Publisher der einen Schlechten job getahn hat um es in den Westen zu bringen.

Zum Headstart und der Refound-Welle. Ich hab mir die Founders geholt um das Spiel zu unterstützen und für die Premium Inhalte, davon mal abgesehen das der Headstart wirklich katastrophal war was Performance angeht, kann ich nicht viel dazu sagen weil ich Beruflich eh nicht dazu kam vor dem 30.05 richtig loszulegen. Über die Entschädigung kann ich mich trotzdem Freuen :). 

Jedes MMORPG hat so seine Probleme am start. Bei Aion waren es zum beispiel die Endlosen Warteschlangen, die maßlos überfüllten anfangsgebiete. Bless Online hat diese Performance hürde in 3 Tagen gestemmt. 

Wieso es zu den schwierigkeiten kam? Naja das spiel wurde ohne CBT Released dazu auf einer Platform die jegliche Preloads vor dem Start verbietet. Also gab es kein indiez dafür wieviele Spieler nun Bless Kaufen werden.

So aber nun zum Spiel:

Story und Musik:

Bless Online versetzt mich ind das feeling von WOW zurück. Eine Riesige Welt voller verschiedener Monster die ich am liebsten alle Tamen würde! Nachdem ich ca 1,5 Stunden in der Character Creation verbracht habe Startete ich das spiel als Panthera, und wurde als Krieger in meinem Clan aufgenommen. Unvorteilhafte ereignise führten jedoch dazu das ich meine Heimat verlassen musste um mit mehreren verschiedenen Charakteren der Verderbnis die über das Land einbricht auf die Schlichen zu kommen. Die Storry nimmt immer mehr fahrt auf und ist WOW all over again ^^.
Die Musik die einen Begleitet ist super! ich wünschte blos das der Wechsel von normaler zu kampf musik nicht so häufig passiert.

Kampf:

Ich musste ich am Anfang an die Steuerung gewöhnen und hab diese auch 2 mal umgebaut damit sie mir passt.
Mittlerweile läuft der Kampf flüssig und macht spaß, ich bin noch lange nicht davor herauszufinden wie man all die verschiednen Stances spielt. Aber das Tanken klappt ganz gut bis jetzt und das Leveln geht auch gut von statten.

Balancing: 

Ja am anfang war das Spiel zu leicht, ich fand deshalb den Patch der alles generft hat klasse... endlich mal werd ich wieder gefordert! Das zurückrudern mit dem gestrigen Patch bringt eine ganz gute Balance ins spiel.... man beißt sich an high LVL Elite alleine die zähne aus kann aber an den Normalen monstern sorgenfrei LVL. Dungeons bleiben weiterhin Knackig.
Lob an Neowiz! 

PVPBalancing:

Da ich derzeit mich noch kaum mit PVP beschäftigt habe kann ich hierzu nicht viel sagen. aber ich denke die PVP Balance wird noch einige zeit ein Thema sein, man darf nicht vergessen das wir eine quasi nicht im Feld getestetes neues Kampfsystem haben.

Interface:

Ich hoffe Bless lässt irgendwann die Modcommunity ran. Ein anpassbares Interface wäre ein Traum!

Graphik und Performance:

Die Server sind mittlerweile super Stabil das game läuft flüssig. ich musste ein bischen an der INI Rumdoktorn um auf 90-120 FPS zu kommen (Ich hoffe hier kommen bessere einstellungsmöglichkeiten Ingame, an der INI Rumdoktorn ist nicht zeitgemäß).
Das Spiel sieht für ein MMO super aus, Manche Gebiete sehen einfach Fantastisch aus!

Endcontent:

Keine Infos, bin da noch nicht.

Zeitvertreib:

Mit dem Taming und Craftig System lässt sich eine menge zeit Totschlagen :)

Fazit:

Ich werde keine Pro punkte für Bless Online nennen da es für mich zu viele sind das ich hier eine Neutrale zusammenfassung geben könnte. mit 71h Spielzeit hat sich der Kauf für mich schon Gelohnt.

Folgende Verbesserungen wünsche ich mir:

Höchste PRIO : Gute Übersetzung! Sowohl Englisch als auch Deutsch

1. Raids Ich liebe RAIDS! 10 / 25 / 40 leute, Kampfmechaniken, Coole Bosse! Raids sind Awesome
2. Anpassbares Interface
3. Bessere Grafik einstellmöglichkeiten
4. Rezepte die anzeigen was man damit Herstellen kann :)
5. Flugmounts! Ja ich will Herr der Wyvern werden!!

It adds a combat style that I haven't really seen before, combing targeted combat like from World of Warcraft with AOE mechanics like Black Desert Online. On top of that though, it has its own unique mechanic in which you can combo your abilities. It has a lot of potential in that it can expand on with a storyline that keeps you intrigued, learning about your individual race you play.

Pros
- Fun combat
- Fun story
- Detailed character creation

Cons
- HORRIBLE CONNECTIONS

To expand on this con, the game just crashes every once in a while. The first hour I was playing this game, I kept lagging with all of my settings on the lowest it can be. And even then, after I was done with the tutorial I tried checking out the store and it froze, a few minutes later crashing. As long as the devs fix this issue I honestly believe this game can be great and even over take other MMOs like BDO or FF14. I play on NA so I can’t speak for other areas of the world but I hope this major problem will be fixed soon so I can enjoy what Bless has to offer.

Sort of entertaining semi tab-targeting combat system that masquerades as a pseudo-action oriented system, but ultimately bland, prosaic, uninteresting and unengaging.

Semi impressive graphics if you actively take it's engine's and game's age into account at all times.

Random, obtuse and anti-creative enemy/mob placements. 50 pumas in an otherwise utterly lifeless and uninteresting surface area here, and 50 wolves in a completely and utterly uninteresting piece of surface area over there. Not too important, but it looks stupid and it is painfully obvious that little to no effort was put into making the habitat of beasts and monsters even remotely realistic or interesting.

Poor translation of quest-text and skills. Even if the quest script is somewhat intelligible, especially if you compare it to most asian MMO's that have come out in the last 6-7 years, but just because you are able to sort of understand where to go next or the motivations of certain NPC's, it's still abhorrently translated. It's too literal, and for people who like good interesting writing, will find none of that here. what is even more strange and frustrating is that they got decent-to-good voice actors to say these absurd lines out loud, sometimes you can even hear the actors pause because of their natural reaction to such an obtuse script...it's just wrong and it should have been better, but it's not the end of the world, it just makes the whole game-world difficult to take seriously.

Huge cities. Really impressive scale. But absolutely devoid of any life whatsoever. This may change in the future, as this is early access...or laziness as it is also called. Let's just call a spade a spade, shall we? Having huge citites such as this and at times even beatiful and interesting architecture is completely meaningless and redundant if there is nothing to fill up that huge empty space. where are all the citizens? where are all the children playing in the streets? where are the sounds of life...i know, early access, but still. If this is not fixed in the duration of a year, then they have failed, miserably. But i will give them time to fill the world with the life that it deserves. Because it's actually kind of nice looking and pretty at times.

Well, for starters, I'd say that the game isn't for everyone... even the MMO lover. It's very PvP intensive, so if you don't enjoy PvP, you won't enjoy this game. 

The difficulty reminds me of vanilla WoW, I'd say. the mobs aren't particularly challenging, but pull too many and you'll find yourself dead pretty quickly. 

The game has been going through some launch pains which seems to have a lot of people haughty, but really the launch was pretty smooth as far as MMOs go. I've been around for the launch of FF14 (1.0 & 2.0), Aion, ArcheAge, and BDO and this was by far the most gameplay I'd gotten into an MMO on launch day. 

The combat comes off as simple at first, but as you level, you find a large skill and ability tree allowing for a large customization to the player's playstyle. It's oddly intuitive for how simple it comes off as. 

Having played a LOT of BDO recently and falling out of it due to the recent shakeups in game mechanics, Bless is simply a refreshing and fun experience compared to that.

- FPS issues almost everywhere in the game. can drop from ~100 fps to ~15fps while standing at the same area. ( I even tried all known ""community"" fixes ) 

- Terrible translation... just terrible. ( some quests and abilities are gibberish ) 

- ""Balance"" patches almost all are big damage/CD nerfs ( -70% damage across the board ), while some abilities still doesn't work ( in some classes root, slow, and stun abilies doesn't work at all )

- Some issues in other versions (KR/JP) still exist -which was fixed in those versions- ( Quest tracking limit bug *now fixed*, Missing quest NPC's, completed quest stuck in the log )

- Game can be grindy as hell, but then most mmo's -espically korean- are like that. ( some people like it anyway ) 

- My main problem is the dev's/company decisions: 
[list]
[*] the pre-release shady/lack of information. ( game price/ founder pack info almost on the last second, no pre-purchase, you had to buy/download the game on the same day of early access of THE early access, which lead to a rocky lunch -since they didn't have an estimated number of players. )
[*] they remade the game but it still uses Unreal Engine 3/ DX9. ( while the mobile version uses UE4 )
[*] the game been out in other regions for few years, the NA/EU version had few ""known"" bugs on the other versions - like the quest log. ( not sure if they learn from their previous ""experiences"" )
[*] Unbalanced combat at the release - everyone was OP, mobs dies in ~1 chain, PvP ends in few hits -  few days later they did a ""Balance"" patch that lowered players damage by ~70% which made it unbalanced the other way around. ( you have to keep in mind the game is not entirely new )
[*] Lack of content at max level. ( on Raids, Arena/PvP areas. only a couple of dungeons which became almost impossible to do after the first ""Balance"" patch. You have to keep in mind ""again"" the game is not new, so the content already exist they just didn't release any )
[*] to sum it all, it feels like they dont have a clear vision on what they want and can do at the moment.

wie jeder weiß ist Bless ein wunderschönes Spiel!
Leider ist das hin und her generfe von dem Publisher zum kotzen!
Manche Chars sind dann ersteinmal nicht spielbar und sollte man für die ein Kostüm gekauft haben ist man natürlich noch mehr enttäucht. 

Man kann behaupten, dass Sie der Communityforderung nachkommen und daher die Chars anpassen aber es gibt Chars die werden weder generft noch werden bei anderen Chars die Skills, wie Sie beschrieben stehen, genau so ausgeführt. 
Das heisst ich habe 4-6 Reskillitems benutzt um feststellen zu müssen das einige Skills nicht ganz funktionieren noch den gewünschten effekt bringen sogar das manche Skillbäume absoluter Schwachsinn sind. 
Leider kann man bis jetzt keine eigenen Ketten erstellen und ist so an die vorgefertigten gbunden, von denen viele einfach keinen Sinn ergeben.

Mitlerweilen ist es so, dass man bis 30+ gut vorankommt und dann ist es ein einziges gekotziges gegrinde um an die Mats zu kommen.

Die Nebenfähigkeiten steigen pro benutzung, beim Juwelierhersteller und Mining wie Sammeln, um 1-5 Punkte jedoch man brauch aber 16k für Level 3 wenn man ca 8 Stunden spielt findet man ca 20-30 Resourcen zum abernten also max 150 Punkte am Tag, wenn es den konstant bleibt.

Gegenstände zur Verbesserung von Items sind auch nicht einfach zu beschaffen und wenn man den ganzen Tag nicht spielen kann, ist es für Arbeitnehmer unmöglich mithalten zu können. 

Der Traum vom Fairbalanceten Gaming ist endgültig geplatzt. 
Jeder der Arbeiten geht wird selbst bei vielen freien Tagen nicht mithalten können. 

Der Funfaktor lässt genau ab Stufe 25-40 richtig nach und man darf zuschauen wie andere chars locker und flockig einen stehen lassen. Beim nerfen wird weder auf das jeweilige equip der Flamer oder Op Chars geachtet noch hat es den anschein, dass der Publisher weiß wie man ein Spiel herstellt. 

Das Premium ist nutzbar aber so richtig viel macht es keinen Sinn. 

Alles in einem lässt mich die momentane Situation glauben, das Neowiz jeden dahergelaufenen lvl 15 charbesitzer einen gefallen tun möchte und damit das ganze Spiel total verhunzt!
Wenn es so weiter geht wird aller 2-3 Tage wieder ein char generft dann der nächste und der nächste. Irgendwann platzt aber dabei der Ar... , zumal selbst beim nerfen nicht darauf geachtet wird ob der char dann noch überhaupt was kann oder nicht wie mein aktueller char der einen zu hohen Cooldown hat bei den PVP Skills der dann in der masse steht und wartet bis er wieder attackieren kann, wenn es dumm kommt wird der char unterbrochen und ich steh nur noch rum und sterbe!

Everyone has been waiting in excited aniticpation for this game to come, and now that it is finally here, they hate what they have got. Bless is a solid game with a decent combat mechanics. It has a story that you can skip through, but gives more backstory to the world if you are into that.

Did it have issues day one, and the first few hours? Yes. Did players freak out of things that are reasonably expactable out of an early access title? Yes. 

The best thing that bless has going for it is not its enjoyable gameplay, large open world, or host of side activities to occupy your time. They have a Dev team that is highly responsive to feedback and frankly one of the quickest I have seen in my 15 years of playing MMOs. The game is worth the purchase price on the face of it, but I am more excited about seein this Dev team and what they will do next.

It might not be introducing anything flashy and new as far as mechanics, but its quality shines through in how it implements many of the mechanics that you might find elsewhere. There are no novelty gimmicks here. It's a game with a solid foundation. 

One of the great things about Bless is that PVP is the name of the game. You are actually rewarded for all forms of PVP, including open world skirmishes. Players from Black Desert Online can have a sigh of relief on this one. In the future, expect to see even more ways to PVP, including territory wars, and 100v100 battles. There wll als be a lot of ""trophy"" aspects to the PVP, allowing to players to show off their PVP prowess.

The monster taming elements are addicting! You can tame like 600 or so monsters you find out in the world to be used as mounts or pets that provide a multitude of buffs. Many of these monsters have a lot of character. Personally, I really like the Water Spirits, with their cute lilypad masks! It's not uncommon for players to engage in a bit of show-and-tell with their tamed monsters.

I'd also like to use this review to address some of the common concerns many detractors have expressed.

Bless has gotten a lot of flack for how its launch went down. Understand that most of this negativity is coming from players who don't seem to remember pretty much every MMO launch, or have never experienced one before. Things break. Things don't go according to plan. The success of a launch shouldn't ride on whether or not the servers get crushed by the surge of new players (this is inevitable), but by how the community managers and devs handle the situation.

So far, I've been very impressed with the transparency and communication the CMs have had with players. The devs have also been working around the clock to implement fixes to common issues on a near daily basis (I expect many of them have easily put in an 80 hr work week for launch). This level of commitment to a product is treasure, and one of the reasons I believe Bless Online will be a successful game with longevity. 

It's true that this is not Bless's first release, and that there is plenty of content that has yet to be introduced to players in this Early Access version of the game. Players need to be patient and understand that with the many core mechanic being redesign comes the need to also balance much of the pre-existing content so that it plays well with the new mechanics. It's not as simple as flipping a switch and suddenly all of that content just works.

Bottomline, Bless Online is a solid game with a dedicated community team and devs working with the players to create something amazing. If you're not sold yet, I suggest watching live streams of gameplay and ask questions. Many people in the community are always happy to help and provide info!",True,1528233156,1528233156,True,0,21,0.541001,True

[h1]Headstart[/h1]

Der Start von Bless war sehr holprig.

[list]
    [*] Es wurde scheinbar mit deutlich weniger Spielern gerechnet, wodurch anfangs nur 1 Server (EU) bereit gestellt wurde.
    [*] Das Tutorial und die Skills waren schrecklich übersetzte, ich habe sicher ca. 15 min im Skill Fenster geklickt bis meine Quest (durch Glück) als erledigt markiert wurde
    [*] ""deutsch"" ist nur der Untertitel in den Videos... Quests und Interface sind ""noch"" in English
    [*] Die Warteschlange war meist bei 1h+
    [*] Es wurden recht viele Wartungen durchgeführt, wegen Server Stabilität sowie hinzufügen weiterer Server
    [*] Am 2ten Tag gab es teilweise 10sec Server lags
    [*] Die 2 Tage Headstart konnte man nur zum Teil ""spielen"" (wegen den oberen Punkten)
[/list]

ABER

[list]
    [*] Es wurden super schnell weitere Server bereit gestellt. Wir sind jetzt schon bei 7(?) EU Servern angekommen!
    [*] Es werden regelmässige Wartungen mit kleinen Patches geliefert ( wo auch Übersetzungen korrigiert werden )
    [*] Es gibt im Internet einige Anleitungen wie man die Performance noch verbessern kann ( und ich bin sicher die Entwickler werden im laufe des EA hier auch noch am Spiel selber etwas machen damit keine manuellen Anpassungen nötig sind )
    [*] 10sec ""Server Lags"" hab ich seit her nicht mehr gehabt, hin und wieder gibt es noch kleine Lags, aber es hat sich schon deutlich verbessert und ich bin zuversichtlich das hier noch mehr optimiert wird
    [*] als Entschuldigung der Server Probleme wurde jedem nochmal die gleiche Menge Shop Währung geschenkt wie im Founder Pack das er gekauft hatte.
[/list]

Generell war der Start im Vergleich zu anderen MMORPG Headstarts nicht viel chaotischer.
Die Server wurden zügig erweitert und bei Problemen gab es direkt Wartungsarbeiten um die gröbsten Probleme schnell zu beseitigen.
Das einzige schade war der 2te Headstart Tag, wo zumindestens ich wegen Server Lags nicht spielen konnte. Aber hierführ hatten wir auch eine Entschädigung bekommen.

[h1]Shop[/h1]

[list]
    [*] Die Shop Wärung kann ( 50 Luma pro Tag ) InGame erworben werden 
    [*] (Achtung meine Persönliche Meinung) Die Items sind ""nice to have"" ( mehr Inventar, Sammelwerkzeug das x Stunden funktioniert und man nicht 10 stacks Spitzhacken mit rumtragen muss :). Skill Resets, Temp. mehr Exp,.. ) vieles ist im Endgabe eh unrelevant. Das einzige was ich ganz nett finde sind die Werkzeuge, aber nur weil ich sehr gerne sammle.
    [*] Viele Items gibt es auch mit Punkten zu kaufen die ""nur"" Ingame erarbeitet werden
	[*] KEINE Items erhöhen deine Attribute (DMG, MP, HP,..)
[/list]

Also meine Persönliche Meinung ist das es kein P2W ist, jedoch kann dies jeder für sich selbst entscheiden.

[h1]Kampfsystem[/h1]

( Aus persönlicher sicht, Klasse: Paladin )

Vorteile:
[list]
    [*] Man muss nachdenken bevor man in den Kampf geht. Haltung sowie Kombo Reihenfolge ist sehr wichtig. ( Ich finde dies daher sehr interresant )
	[*] Man kann aus mehreren Haltungen 2 Auswählen welche man im Kampf (mit kurzer Abklingzeit) hin und her wechseln kann
	[*] Das Wechseln von Haltungen hat ebenfalls Effekte (Passive und Aktive). Z.b hat der Paladin eine Haltung die einen Self-Heal aktiviert wenn man in diese Hineinwechselt und eine andere erhöht kurzzeitig den Schaden.
	[*] Der Kampf läuft (fast) flüssig, hin und wieder fehlt leider der ""autohit"" um die letzten 1HP des Mobs wegzuhauen. Aber im Ganzen finde ich der Kampffluss sehr angenehm da man eine Kombo an die andere koppeln kann.
	[*] Mana muss gut eingeplant werden. Skills zum Mana herstellen sind meist in Kombos eingebaut. Mann kann daher entscheiden ob man aktuell Damage machen will oder Mana herstellen muss. Vor dem Balance Patch war dies sehr wichtig, danach hat der Paladin fast endlos Mana ( auser beim Heilen ). Hier wurde aber schon angekündigt das die Klassen noch weiter angepasst werden.
	[*] Jeder Skill ""in jeder"" Kombo kann unterschiedlich geskillt werden. Es gibt dabei immer 2 Richtungen. Meist eine DMG Richtung ein die andere entweder Mana Verbrauch senken oder Abklingzeit reduzieren
	[*] Skill Verbessern geht über ""Gems"", hierbei gibt es verschiedene Arten ( für Kombo Skills, Passive Skill sowie Attribute Eigenschaften ) diese bekommt man im Quest Verlauf. Jedoch droppen auch Gegner Kisten in denen man neutralle ""Gems"" findet die man ab einer bestimmten Menge umwandeln kann um Sie dann für die Skills zu nutzen. Soweit ich das also verstanden hab kann man am Ende alle Kombos hochleveln, wird warscheinlich nur recht lange dauern.
	[*] Es gibt verschiedene ""Taktiken"", eine ""Taktik"" definiert welche 2 Haltungen man ausgerüstet hat, hierdurch kann man verschieden Builds machen und nach belieben hin und herswitchen ohne immer im Skill Menü die Haltungen neu einstellen zu müssen.
	[*] Manche Kombo-Abfolgen haben unterschiedliche Reichweiten, daher ist man recht oft in Bewegung und steht nicht nur wie angewurzelt an einer Stelle
[/list]


Nachteile:
[list]
    [*] Autohit wäre manchmal ganz nett
	[*] Wenn ein Skill nicht trifft wird die Kombo Abgebrochen und man steht dann teilweise dumm in der Gegend bis ein Skill wieder bereit ist ( Wurde aber bereits angekündigt das dies korrigiert wird)
	[*] Tutorial braucht einen Überarbeitung. Man hat 3 Skill Bäume ( Kombos, Passive und Attribute Eigenschaften ). Hier verliert man Anfangs etwas den Überblick
	[*] Als Heiler hab ich das Gefühl das Skill A z.B eine Reichweite von 10 hat und die darauf folgende Kombo aber nur 5. Ob dies wirlich der fall ist kann ich nicht sagen, aber durch den schnellen Kampf, kam bei mir das Gefühlt auf. Kann natürlich auch daran liegen das das Ziel sich bewegt hat. Da man aber, zumindestens am Anfang, stark darauf achtet welche Kombo man als Nächstes ausführt geht einem das Gefühl über die Reichweite der Skills etwas verlohren.
	[*] Manche Skills fesseln z.b den Gegner, dies Zählt jedoch nicht als schaden, wenn in der gleichen Zeit ein anderer Spieler den Gegner anschlängt zählt der Kill nicht. Was gerade beim vervollständigen der Monster Bücher etwas stört.
[/list]

Aber kurz gesagt, mir macht das Kampfsystem Spass. Ich liebe es wenn man im Kampf auch nachdenken muss und nicht einfach nur stur auf seine Tasten schlägt :)
Was Schaden, Mana Verbrauch etc.. angeht muss noch einiges gemacht werden. Jedoch ist das Kampfsystem komplett neu gebaut worden und daher ist Bless Online auch als EA erschienen.
Die nächsten Monate werden unteranderen hierfür benutzt. Um das Kampfsystem in PvE sowie PvP optimal auszurichten.

Bisher hatte ich noch kein PvP erlebt, aber durch das Kombo und Haltungssystem gehe ich davon aus das es echt interresant werden kann. ( Und ich bin eigendlich kein PvP Liebhaber )

( Ich würde gerne noch über Crafting, PvP etc.. sprechen aber das wäre zuviel für das Review :) )

[h1]Fazit[/h1]

Ja es hackt noch an ein paar Stellen, auch an der Performance.
Aber in der letzten Woche haben wir gesehen das den Entwicklern das Spiel nicht egal ist.
Es wurde aktiv auf Community Wünsche gehört und fast Täglich hatten wir bisher eine Wartung die Kleinigkeiten korrigiert hat 
Ja! Wartungen sind zwar nervig, aber besser wie 1 Monat auf Bugfixes oder Balance Anpassungen warten zu müssen!

Mir persönlich macht das Spiel Spass und man muss bedenken das Spiel ist schon 4(?) Jahre alt. 
Dafür hat sich die Grafik gut halten und gleichzeitig hat es den Vorteil das schon viel im Spiel umgesetzt wurde ( auch wenn Teile derzeit noch zurück gehalten werden )

Falls die Entwickler so weitermachen und die Performance in den Griff bekommen seh ich viele schöne Stunden auf uns zu kommen :)

My issue isn't with the down servers or FPS issues or any of the bugs that will get worked out.  My issue is with the following items:

1. Region, they've moved this game to be english but haven't even added in the UK english keyboards, what this means is that the keys that aren't on an american keyboard don't work.

2. Translation, they've missed a lot of things in the translation leaving people stuck (including myself for a while) stuck in the beginning phase not able to complete the into missions and join the actual game.  I had to watch a video on how to pass the intro in order to progress into the game itself due to bad instructions.

3. Censorship, I understand censoring things to a degree, I was a bit dissapointed that they took out the nudity but can accept that as a marketing item.  What I don't understand is that they removed words such as Button and a number of others so you have trouble communicating in game with outher people.  

4. Gameplay, the combat system, though unique is a pain to use.  It doesn't feel natural or even fun when (using a UK keyboard) you have to travel all the way from the WASD keys to the area near the enter key to switch stances in the middle of combat, sorry but nobody's hand is that large.  Not to mention that the key combo's to hit 1 then R or T, etc. don't really feel right when fighting.  The beginning mobs are tough enough that they can kill you in the beginning when you're trying to get used to it making it not quite an enjoyable experience.  It may have just been me but even the combat motions though pretty seem disconnected and made me feel that this was a bit dated for some reason, maybe I just don't like the game engine or something.  

5. Questing, the quest and storyline felt empty to me.  Not sure if it's the bad translation or if it's something deeper but I kept feeling disconnected and empty trying to play through and kept giving up.  Even from the beginning you have to choose a side and are forced (or at least I was) into once side for some reason I can't figure out and still have no idea what either side stands for.  Bit of a mess really.

Normally when I get a new game I play it for hours on end till I get a feeling of this but with Bless I kept having to force myself to try to get into it and wasn't able to find anything that made me want to go back other than the face that I paid money for this.

That's me done for a change, at least I figured it out early on :/

IMO there shouldn't even be reviews until this game is out of early access. There will be bugs, there will be constant tweaking and fixes - that is what an early access game is about. Shaping and morphing into whatever form this game will take is part of the process. Part of the community's role here should be to provide helpful guidance to the Bless Team on what we think will make the ultimate MMO experience. The dev team is then to decide whether to take that feedback or not and if it aligns with their vision for the game.

I have a list of suggestions that I will post elsewhere, but if you look at some of the most successful MMOs, player to player trading is critical to a better user experience. The player base should be in the most control of the market, pricing, and demand of items. Keep the market, but also enable P2P trades. I would rethink this strategy and look at what others are doing here. Just my 2 cents.

Das Kampfsystem spielt sich angenehm und am Balancing wird permanent gearbeitet. Die Dungeons sind spaßig und es wird allgemein viel Wert auf Gruppenarbeit gelegt. 30 Euro für ein Early Access Pay2play-MMORPG ist nicht die Welt, wenn man bedenkt, dass sich hier noch einiges besser werden kann. Das Spiel hat nämlich Potential, wird aber aktuell den hohen Erwartungen (noch) nicht gerecht.

Meiner Meinung nach gibt es nichts Spannenderes, als mit anzusehen, wie sich das Spiel nach und nach entwickeln wird. Es gibt aber keine Garantie, ob das Endprodukt auch gut sein wird. Wer sich dessen nicht bewusst ist, sollte seihn Geld lieber in andere Dinge investieren.

Since I've seen a number of ""I've never written a review but I really gotta bash this game...""-types of reviews I'll do my part and write review and partly a statement to the Developer Studio. I feel like part of the MMO player community base is losing the grasp of what an MMO actually is. 
Let me stress the most important aspect for me here:(Yes, for me. I do not claim to have absolute knowledge about how perfect game design looks like and how the mechanics of developing a game work. I just consider myself an experienced gamer.)
This is an MMORPG. For me as a player it means that it evolves around players playing together. It's a social RPG experience. For a Dev that probably means years of work on the same damn game, so it needs commitment.

Ill start with major flaws and then go into my opinion why I keep playing this game, even in the current condition.


[i][b]Flaws:[/b][/i] 
[i]-Performance issues:[/i]
FPS aren't stable. Read other reviews, for details. Rage. Or take 1/5 of a second to google how to fix the performance issues, you'll find guides that help you out there. It's a PC game so unlike on consoles where you're running on constant 30 FPS without being able to do anything about it, you can fix it here. So make use of your advantages on PC.
[i]-Translation is bad:[/i]
Some translations are quite weird.(There have been translation updates already by now)
Some instructions are just not clear:
(Cash currency being locked to one char only, same for gifts etc) which leads to a number of frustrated players losing their stuff after deleting chars. That just sucks. That goes for a number of things

The first few days of the launch were very rough. I won't go into it. You've probably heard enough about it. What have we got now?
Two balance patches, adjusting class skills, cooldowns, damage, regeneration, monster HP, dungeons, a new PvP Battleground, etc. several hotfixes, maintenances even on weekends, patches bugfixes and more to come. And of course a lot of things need further fixing and adjustments
All of that within 2 weeks. We have maintenances every 2-3 days.


[i][b]Why do I like this game?[/b][/i]

Odd as it is:
[u]This game is inconvenient for most players who are looking for a smooth log-in have fun, log-out experience.[/u]
What that means is: There are no shortcuts. You cannot teleport around the map freely. There is not an easy party finder/dungeon teleport, you actually have to run to the dungeon you want to do. You need to run back to your corpse after dieing. Recent patches have nerfed the dmg so hard that some classes don't have it easy to just run around leveling solo.


[i][b]How can I like all these things without being called a masochist?[/b][/i]

Because it makes people in this game actually stick together. 
Having a hard time with your class means you need to party up and ask people if you want to go hunt together. What's the problem with that if you're playing an MMO?
There are different types of party buffs depending on the setup of your party from race to class. It supports variety and people teaming up.(Special buff for 5 mages etc.)
Crafting professions are limited on a character so in the long run you'll need a variety of players and seek them to get what you want.
You gather around the entrance of dungeons and try to recruit players. It keeps places busy and not just an entrance you unlock once and afterwards you forget where the dungeon ever was.
Having no teleport options actually gives you a feeling of the entire map. Travel time matters, you appreciate the landscape design, again and again and sometimes find new things you didn't see before.
I'm tired of convenient quick-plays, dungeon finders, no interaction between players (I don't mean guilds, I mean the majority of the community) rushing content, teleporting and people just getting to max level and then spending 95% of their time in the main city because they can quickly access everything from there while the rest of the map dies out whilst screaming for new content.
There are many other things I could mention but I'll wrap it up there.


[i][b]Are these things super new and innovative?[/b][/i]

No. These ideas are actually old. We've seen them before. We've seen them in other games as well. But what makes this game worth playing for me is the way they gathered these ideas and put them all into one game. For the first time in a long while I feel like playing an old MMO, just with updated combat systems, mechanics, fresh graphics and different setting and that's okay for me. 

If you don't like that, if you want the newest dynamic action-MMO with high-end effects and mindbending twists, convenient play, and have a smooth polished experienced served on your plate, this game just isn't for you. 
But if you enjoy investing time, teaming up with people and want a glimpse of the feeling you once had from MMOs like Vanilla WoW, a bit hard, a bit inconvenient but made worth by meeting people who're up for it struggle together with you, give it a try.

0,12,1,6459,6459,76561198053107542,0,english,False,42511241,"[u][h1]This game is currently receiving a lot of criticism from people whom:[/h1][/u]
1. Solely based their reviews based on a game's most problematic period of time - launch.
2. Spent generally less than 10 hours playing the game and do not have a clue about the fundamentals of combat.

For anyone [b]""on the fence""[/b] and looking at reviews to push you over on one side, let me preface by telling you this...

I've progressed to level 45 as a Ranger, I've put almost 100 hours into the game (idling as well) into Leveling, Taming, Crafting, and PvP.

While there has been issues with the launch of the game, we should all be used to that by now... Could they have handled it better, sure.  But even almost every AAA game has the same issues as well.  This was nowhere near the ""worst launch"", and what makes it better than most is their response time on fixes.  These guys are averaging one maintenance a day almost, and some of them are not small ones.

They've balanced combat mechanics twice already in under 4 days.

My only gripes about this game thus far, is that they treat this game currently as a Test Server, and that's understandable considering this is ""Early Access"" and that's what Early Access is for, but I think we should not try to go to extreme opposites in terms of patching to test.

Also, the initial performance of the game is poor.  I'm sure these are things they can work on and there's workarounds by changing the .INI files.  But its not to a point where the game is even remotely unplayable.  Your just not getting 60+ FPS always.


That being said, the PvP before the first balance patch was a bit ridiculous, as any class could one shot any other class.  So it basically became, who saw the target first and popped a CC on them would win. PvM was basically a joke.

PvP is definitely A LOT better in its current state, raid vs raid open world pvp is fun, and 1v1 PvP (will be) fun again.
PvM is now more challenging, to say the least, and I believe that the 20-30% HP nerf to monsters is all that was needed.


The 2nd balance patch that came out today got rid of almost every problem that I as a Ranger had experienced, without giving in to the people just spouting MOAR DAMAGE!  They are holding true to their ""core beliefs"" on how the game should be and how they'd like it to go in a direction, while also listening to players feedback and incorporating some of the good ideas.

So the damage bonus is only reached for players ""playing their class right"" and chaining their abilities/spells.

Additionally, the problematic Mage Spam Button, and Guardian insane CC lock has also been dealt with.  These 2 things made it basically impossible to kill a Mage or Guardian as a Ranger, while also giving Rangers a higher chain bonus timer, which was much needed because we were constantly getting locked out of our chains with CC all day.


At the end of the day, what I'm saying is this...

[h1]Would I recommend Bless Online currently for $30: [/h1]
[b]YES, with the caveat -[/b] [i]Understand this is a early access game, and things are going to be changing constantly. [/i] The devs are patching and improving the game at unbelievable speeds, many and most launch issues have already been fixed, and now devs are at the point where they will be continuing to add in content.  

In nearly 8 days, these devs have managed to fix the login issues and launch issues, add in 15 v 15 PvP to the game, deleted a duping exploit and handled it, added 2 combat patches that basically saved PvP combat, and made PvM actually require a little bit of thought and stance play-through, meanwhile making Dungeons Harder then the super easy run through it was before.

The game is fun, the stances are actually a unique refreshment to the game, PvP is everywhere and is a lot of fun (besides when you saw a mage or guardian - but that's fixed now).  There's raids of people running around all the time, the towns are filled with people, there's people being super social all the time and forming parties for the buffs you receive, and the animations/transitions between them make this game ""feel"" good and responsive.

I tried my best to look over the obvious mistakes, such as presetting unchangable combos where they put a ranged taunt right after a melee attack or a skill that has bonus effects on 0 bravery stacks, right after a skill that adds 1 bravery stack (and many more).
But with every single patch lately, the game developers just made clear that they have never experienced their own game and refuse to put deeper thoughts into it.
(Latest example: A skill's cooldown got increased from 7s to 30s, while the possible cooldown spec remained on the same flat amount of max -0.8s)
Also the damage and balance adjustments are randomly guessed by the team behind it and even though they really react fast to the community, it feels like they should much rather take their time or fire most of their responsible people.

Besides these horrible and hilarious adjustments, the game shows many game changing bugs, such as randomly making your dodge ability unusable even though it's up and ready or making you lose runes from your gear (which are not supposed to be lost while pvping) on the exclusive pvp battlegrounds just because a randomly implemented pve mob killed you there.

This game is a great example of how to add insult to injury with every single patch and i could just make the list of horrible bugs and skilltrees longer and longer, as i just gave a few very recent example above... but lets end this review with a solid rating of 1/10

Ich würde mich selber als MMORPG-Spieler der ersten Stunde bezeichnen, habe mit Everquest 1, Everquest 2, Vanguard und einiges mehr viele der 1st Generation MMORPGs durch... Alles das was danach kam war mir im Endeffekt zu einfach und zu wenig komplex. Und da fängt es bei Bless Online an gut zu werden.

Zuerst mal zu den positiven Dingen:
- Sehr detaillierter Charaktergenerator, lässt keine Wünsche offen
- Schöne Skill-Trees, lässt viel Raum offen für eigene Taktiken
- Grafik ist zwar nicht mehr auf dem aktuellsten Stand, aber es gibt trotzdem eine Menge schöner Ecken
- Quest-Lines sind sehr interessant gestaltet, und ist nicht immer nur der Standard wie ""Hole drei Flaschen Wein von Person X"", ""Kloppe 20 Mobs hier und da"" etc. 
- Serverpopulation ist hoch, kein Problem mit Gruppen

Das ganze fühlt sich ein wenig oldschool an, aber das ist genau das was ich gesucht habe, daher kann ich eigentlich jedem Spieler der die oben genannten Titel kennt nur empfehlen mal in Bless Online reinzuschauen

Negativ:
- Einige Lags, grade in grossen Städten, aber das regelt sich sobald alle Daten geladen wurden
- Spiel nicht komplett in Deutsch, Zwischensequenzen aber mit Untertiteln

O Bless Online, esta sendo um game muito interessante, a desenvolvedora NEOWIZ BLESS STUDIO, esta sempre escutando a comunidade, e isso faz toda diferença.
Os ponto positivos, é que o game tem diversas coisas a se fazer, desde PVP e PVE, e o mesmo vem tendo atualização de balanceamento, que mostra o interesse da desenvolvedora, perante os jogadores e o game.
Diferente de outros mmorpgs, o BLESS não tem compartilhamento de baú com os personagens da mesma conta, isso acho um grande problema, mas não implica diretamente no game, pois você vai focar principalmente em um personagem só.
Eu particularmente gosto bastante de mmorpgs de tríade (TANKER, DPS e HEALER), então o game esta me atendendo bastante, e acredito que ele so tem a melhorar, com a atenção da desenvolvedora está dando.

Pontos Negativos:

nach einigen start Schwierigkeiten und langen Warteschlangen zum Release der EA-Version.
Hat sich das Spiel schnell gefangen. Die Entwickler leisten gute Arbeit.
Fast täglich wird am Spiel geschraubt und versucht es für alle besser zu gestallten.
Eine Eigenschaft die man selten sieht!

Das Spiel an sich ist sehr gelungen und bringt viel Spaß und Aufgaben mit sich.
Im Moment ist es jedoch durch kürzliche Balancing-Änderungen sehr schwer solo zu spielen,
da es sich hier jedoch um ein MMO handelt, stellt das weniger ein Problem dar.

Seit langem mal wieder ein MMO das man genießen und länger spielen kann.
Keine vorteile für Echtgeld Kunden so wie in Archeage! Was auch sehr zum Spielspaß beiträgt.

Ich bin im großen und ganzen sehr zufrieden und warte jetzt einfach wie es sich entwickelt.

Все знают, что в первые дни был ужас. Корейцы целый год занимались переделкой геймплея, но забили на баги и оптимизацию. 

Но почему я рекомендую эту игру?

Плюсы:
- Мне понравились изменения геймплея, скилов, работы маунтов/петов и тд.
- Разработчики после фейла на старте РЕАЛЬНО РВУТ одно место, чтобы исправиться. Баги, баланс, все правится буквально на лету одним днем.

Минусы:
- Перед тем как играть, надо обязательно поправить текстовые конфиги, как делали это в РУ версии. Если потратить 10 минут, то даже к оптимизации у меня претензий особых нет.
- Хай лвл контента на старте нет, но на днях должны добавить. Для сумасшедших задеров это минус, для обычного игрока не заметно, пока докачаешься.

If you want this game to flourish then get in start playing and give FEEDBACK. Don't just whine that its not what you wanted and go else where, thats completely unhelpful. From the very start of announcing that it was coming out to early access they asked us to be apart of it. To help them make the changes that would allow this game to succeed the best for our area. 

So don't listen to those that are crying for their money back. These are the people that ignored the early access label and demanded a perfect game right from the beginning. These people are foolish, and apperently can't read. If you want to get into the game early, and help shape it for the better, then buy it and give feedback to the devs about what you like and dislike, and if others share your opinion then it will be changed. See you in game ^^.

P.S The best thing you can do in the beginning is clicking the options above chatbar, and unchecking faction and help chat.

And FPS problem, for me is nothing, i might get lag when rendering the map but just a few FPS drop, it's MMORPG 2018 which is mean your PC need to upgrade not complaining. Don't compared to BDO, it's different ofcause it's not the same game, if BDO focus on Combat PVP thing(3.5 years experience) then Bless is a bit more casual in PVP and PVE but's there's community in the game, for example, Dungeon and grinding. the reason is BDO doesn't has one, only World Boss that only guild member going together(sometime party? and solo) and grinding, BDO just solo and spending your whole day farming in same place, same monster. But Bless there's different. I'm not saying which one is better, it's just the whole experience which one is suit for you. And the game just Open beta for a week, so it is not so big deal if the game not 100% run. I believe they will fixed it, they have a lot of work to do. But people are crying why they don't fixing it(maybe).

Mir sind bereits einige Bugs über den Weg gelaufen, die sich jedoch bereits mit einem einfachen Neustart des Spiels behoben ließen.
Die Performance des Spiels ist sein größter Kritikpunkt. Die Server laufen zwar mittlerweile sehr stabil, jedoch gibt es teilweise starke fps einbrüche, sobald man sich den großen Spieleransammlungen in den Städten nähert. (der fps fix, der im Internet zu googlen ist, hilft hier schonmal spürbar, behebt aber nicht gänzlich die fps drops)

People who complain about performance issues are complete morons, since developres already fixed it, and even before, you were able to fix that, just by searching on google for 2 minutes.

The characters are unbalanced at the moment, but this is pretty common in every new MMORPG... like in BDO every time a new class comes out, it rules all other for months before nerf...
This game is not pay to win at all, the duengons on early are easy, but later on you do have to group up, so it is fun.

Overall, I can recommend this game, because it is decent already, and the developers are truly working on it even as I write this review, so in a few weeks, game will be real good. Yes it had a bad start, but they did not leave it like that.  They heard us, and they are working for us.

0,18,2,880,880,76561198113578135,0,english,False,42504983,"Bless online is a game that had everyone hyped. It was a new MMORPG for people that have pretty much-tried everything else and just hadn't found their home. We were all excited even though in other place's it launched at 6 year's ago has failed at least 3 time
We were promised action combat for every character and it was supposed to be revamped for us. Now when the game was released (Not full released as it is still in early access) we did not see that action combat other than on one character which is the beserker.
As of right now, we are finding out that they can't find a way to implicate that in the game. Not just that but also the healer of the game which is called the Paladin will not be receiving action combat. We all jumped on the hype train excited for this action combat
only to not receive it at early launch. What irks me about this is that it should have been all tested beforehand and if they couldn't implicate it yet they should have given us a heads up but it seems they didn't want to.
We were also promised that when the game launched into its early access that we would be all on one server. When the game launched the game pretty much crashed and many people couldn't get past the loading screen. Meaning they ended up having to open more servers.
They did not actually plan ahead for any of this and locked servers on us which lead to us not being able to play with our friends. We also didn't get as good of graphics or stabilized servers that the game has in other countries.
We have all been watching this game for the past 6 years and watch how in Korea and Japan how smoothly the game runs but not for us. We get an excess amount of lag and the graphics don't look as good. When we heard that it was going to be launching here we all got excited.
We thought that we would pretty much be getting the same game just with better combat and a few other things but that is not what was released. We got a different UI then what we have seen (You can't even really mess with it) We got a laggy version.
The translation was honestly not what l expected. You couldn't even understand what your skills did and everytime you leveled it would tell you that you have reached 3 level. (Yes they have fixed SOME translation) The game also isn't supposed to be a cash grab but that's not the case.
There are things in the in-game store such as potions, experience and gold boosters, repair kits, resurrection scrolls, teleport scrolls, and even 20% dungeon point boosters.  That gives an advantage for other players that jump on this. The game is also a cash grab IMO.
With things such as having to pay to buy these tickets to teleport to the dungeons in the game. Yes, you can walk/fly there but that is going to take a lot of time. Costumes are $20 each along with pets, pet costumes and mounts.
On top of paying $15 dollars on re-doing your character (Not that big of a deal), you have to play 10 dollars for more inventory space. Also if you mess up your skills? You have to pay to reset them or if you wanna just try out a different build.
This wouldn't be an issue except this game isn't free-to-play. No, this game comes at different prices ($29.99 for the basic game, $39.99 for the standard edition and for the founders pack $159.99 and along with a premium membership if you wanna pay for it.
Why should I pay REAL cash to teleport to dungeons when I'm already paying for the game and the Premium membership or to change my skills with real money.?
(ff14 you can buy stuff with IN GAME stuff to reset your skills before they just did them for you and you buy that game with a membership) That is just ridiculous. Here is another funny thing about that founder's pack.
It comes with an outfit, a skin for your weapon, a mount, a pet and a title. That's all really cool right? Well here is a warning. It is a one time use of one character on any server. Meaning once you open it that first time that is it you don't get it again.
No, you can't transfer it or do anything that any other MMORPG has allowed you to. So you better be sure that is the server and the character that you want. Now did they warn about this? No, they did not and people didn't know and deleted their character to switch servers.
Only to find out they just lost their stuff! What did the developers do about it? NOTHING. Not even when people put in support tickets all they did was just send them a survey! You don't do that to your players!
There as so many things that they left out before we bought the game. There are so many things I don't understand what they were thinking. Like how in any MMORPG you can go into settings and uncap your fps from 60? you aren't able to do that.
You actually have to go into your game files and change that yourself and you also just to make the game run a LITTLE smoother have to now go in and do other modifications. Even with that the game still doesn't run smooth.
That shouldn't have to be like that. They shouldn't have charged us to pretty much be their beta testers!! Cause that's what we ARE! We are beta testers to this game. $159.99 beta tester if we chose to spend that.
They should have completely tested this game out before releasing it on us like this. Now I know people are going to try and defend the game going ""It's early access) I know that it is and I was one of those people trying to defend it but after all of this week of doing research.
As well as testing this game and lagging on a computer that I shouldn't be lagging on. With the graphics as well (Not saying that are horrible cause they aren't) Just that I shouldn't be lagging cause they aren't top notch. There wasn't even any kind of endgame when the early access released. We didn't even see a glimpse of it.
Now as I know it may seem it I am not trying to say ""Don't play the game"" Maybe it seems that way but no all I am saying is to wait before jumping in and spending money on it until they actually fix all the many issues that this game has.
Let me tell you that this game has more issues than what I have stated. The developers of this game are listening to some of our problems and trying to fix some of the issues. Like recently when the game was launched people were pretty much one shotting everything.
So what they ended up doing was nerfing everyone's damage by 80%. What I saw in the game was comical with people saying that if you could kill lvl 40 mobs you were a god. Now with that issues, they have listened to their players and are trying to fix it. That's great but on all the other issues they have not really been saying anything about it just that they are more worried about fixing this one character than trying to take care of the graphics. I will give them credit where credit is due. They are trying their best to fix issues that they think are important to people. I just wish they would address a lot of the other ones that some of us players have instead of ignoring them. At the end of everything though. If you have the money to support them or if with everything you don't care and still want to buy the game just to have something to play and have fun with friends. I say go for it because if you can get past everything you will have fun with friends. Then buy it, but if you can't afford it and are thinking of just taking that chance. Well, I won't tell you not to but I won't say YES GO FOR IT. In the end just really think about it because at the end of it all as of right now I am going for that refund until I see what concerns I have being addressed.",False,1528189142,1528189142,False,12,133,0.760506,True

- game performance is still an issue unless you patch your self manually
- translation issues
- quest line is not immersing. 
- too easy to attaint XP in dungeons in lower dungeons which makes it too easy to bypass the content

Pros:
- they are really working to fix the issues. Patches are done on a daily basis. Not like weeks between releases.
- they seem to really listen to communitiy feedback
- Battle grounds are fun and the performance isnt really dropping with massive ammount of players, this is the same for massive monster hunting
- Pet and mount system is fun, and you are really engaged.
- Crafting is intresting, although i feel there should be more recipee options

Vorab möchte ich anmerken, dass ich durchaus berücksichtige, dass es sich hierbei um Early Acess handelt.
Ich beobachte Bless Online schon seit einer ganzen Weile.
Als alt eingesessener MMORPG-Fan hat Bless (wie bei so vielen anderen auch) mein Interesse geweckt.
Die MMORPG Scene ist ausgehungert und wir setzten daher ser viel Hoffnung in dieses Spiel.
Ich habe mir das Spiel am 30. trotz negativer Reviews gekauft weil ich mir selbst ein Bild machen wollte und habe dabei versucht so objektiv wie möglich an die Sache heran zu gehen.
Was ich anfänglich als typischen ""early acess never play on patch day hate-train"" abgetan habe hat sich dann doch als echte Enttäuschung entpuppt.

Die Vermarktung des Spiels:
Ist meiner meinung ganz geschickt gemacht worden und ich würde es schon fast als Betrug einstufen. 
Wie kommt man überhaupt auf die Idee ein bereits zwei mal gescheitertes Spiel noch ein drittes Mal auf den Markt zu bringen? Und am Wichtigsten wie schafft man es die Spieler dazu zu BRINGEN dieses Spiel überhaupt zu spielen? 
Nun ja ich würde sagen es ist der richtige Zeitpunkt, die Leute sind ausgehungert.
Es wird einem viel verprochen, was dann im Endeffekt davon gehalten wird ist erstmal zweitranging.
Die Leute mit tollen Videos heiß machen, einen Hype auslösen.
Den Leuten das Gefühl geben, dass sich gekümmert und bemüht wird.
Und ganz wichtig nach dem Motto: Das Spiel ist bereits zwei mal gescheitert, nein das können die sich nicht noch ein drittes mal erlauben, das MUSS jetzt besser sein""

Performance:
Hierzu muss ich wohl nichts mehr sagen denn wir alle wissen, dass die performance unteridisch ist.
Unreal Engine 3 und DirektX 9 man kann nicht viel erwarten.

Combat:
Meiner meinung nach einfach nur ein liebloses zwanghaft ""anderes"" Kombo-System, dass nur dazu dient Interesse zu wecken aber wirklich Sinn macht dort nichts.
Ich persönlich möchte meine eigene Rotation benutzen und nicht ständig gezwungen werden ""R"" zu drücken aber das ist wirklich Geschmackssache.

Interface:
Das ist einer meiner größten Knackpunkte.
Ich war SCHOKIERT über die Aufmachung des Interfaces.
Es sieht nicht nur billig aus es IST auch billig.
Unverständlich nach so langer Entwicklung.
Keine Anpassungsmöglichkeiten, unschönes Design, unübersichtlich.
Denkt mal and das Skill Interface.. abslouter Horror. Das Interface sieht abslout Free2Play aus und selbst dann ist es noch mangelhaft.

Grafik:
Die Welt sieht schlichtweg langweilig aus.
Die Städte haben mir ganz gut gefallen aber ansonsten fahl, leer, lieblos.

Story: 
hierzu kann ich nicht viel sagen, da ich soweit nicht gekommen bin.
Wirkt auf mich in der ersten Schritten wie eine typisches standart mmo Fantasy palaber.
Nichts was meine Aufmerksamkeit wecken würde oder mir Lust macht das Spiel weiter zu spielen.
Die cutscenes waren jedoch recht ansehnlich.

Charaktererstellung: 
Gut, alle die BDO gespielt haben kenne eine ähnliche Charaktererstellung schon. 
Viele möglichkeiten einen schönen und ganz individuellen Char zu erstellen, kann man nicht meckern.

Übersetzung:
Google Translate und Voiceactings von schlechter audioqualität (zumindest was meinen Charakter angeht)

Fazit:
ich finde es schön wenn es leute gibt, die dieses Spiel tatsächlich genießen können ABER meiner Meinung nach wurden wir hier ganz klar betrogen.Es steht außer Frage, dass Kontent und Überarbeitung versprochen wurden, die schlichtweg einfach nicht vorhanden sind. Das allein sagt schon genug über die Entwickler aus.Für das was man derzeit geboten bekommt sind die Preise Wucher! Ich möchte diese Entwickler auf keinen Fall supporten. Würde jedem empfehlen, der trotzdem noch interessiert ist einige Wochen zu warten und das Spiel weiterhin zu beobachten.
Allgemein hatte ich in meiner kurzen aber intensiven Spielzeit durchgängig das gefühl, dass alles nur lieblos und ohne viele Hintergedanken sprichwörtlich einfach nur dahin geklatscht wurde. Für ein F2P Titel wäre das in Ordnung aber wir ZAHLEN dafür. Viele Spieler sagen ""Ja aber man kann das auch nicht mit Spielen wie WOW, Final Fantasy Online oder GW2 vergleichen. Klar kann man das denn ihr vergesst wir zahlen dafür Geld. Natürlich kann man nicht den selben Kontent erwarten wie in Spielen, die schon seit so langer Zeit erfolgreich sind ABER man sollte doch wenigstens ein schönes, durchdachtes und solides gameplay geboten bekommen nach 7 Jahren ""Entwicklung"" 

Derzeit kann ich das spiel abslout nicht Empfehlen.

-Performence , Terrible fps , stuttering and thats with the .ini fixes. Without the ini fixes its unplayable at an enjoyable framerate
-PvP combat is a mix of hitting each other with wet noodles and trying to catch any ranged class as a melee, there is no ""Fun"" in the combat , it feels delayed and animations are slow. The current patch balance is terrible , and the 15v15 seems broken to only 1-2 groups of players being able to actually get in.
For a PvP based game, open world pvp is poorly done , the rewards you get for killing another player is some exp and 1 honor point, so you need 180 kills for 1 rune? seems excessive considering you get 700 points for 1 win in the 15v15 battleground

-PvE , you need pet/mount food constantly available if you want to use these features, taming monsters is a luxury if you go enchanting profession , good luck buying the high level (35+) scrolls on the market.
Grinding monsters is lackluster at best.
The game doesnt feel relevant in todays MMORPG genre , maybe it wouldve been good back in 2002?

-Crafting is really RNG based on dungeon drops for crafting 1 piece ! , can take you a week to get 1 drop.
Gathering requires you to have 2 items from which you can buy and use for 1 hour from the vendor or get a premium version that lasts as long as your premium time.

However, it is still in early access and it is kinda to be expected. It may have been released in other regions, but this version is more tailored to us so it isnt exactly an exact copy.

In all honesty, I enjoy the game a lot. The optimization isn´t too bad once you edit the ini files (look up on redit how to do that). The whole old school MMORPG grind is really nice. It´s pretty fun as of now.

One of the biggest reason I actually enjoy the game and want to stick around, even with all the downsides, is the company. The game may be a bit wonky as of now, but the company seems to actually care about the community. They constantly communicate with the players as well as take the player´s feedback seriously and trying to improve the game following that feedback. This is already more than a lot of MMORPG companies do now our days. The company also releases patches and fixes so rapidly.

They may not be giving out the best patches, however those patches are the first of many so it should hopefully improve. 

A lot of the player hate and negative opinion come from them seemingly not knowing what they want. DPS is too high and game is too easy, DPS is too low and they only want their class to be buffed and so on. Meh, if you enjoy the game, play it.

It's running a last gen engine [[ Unrreal 3 modifded ]] The game has been out for three years in other parts of the world and it is poorly optimized even for my rig. The FPS bounce between good 60 all the way down to 20 with just NPCs in some areas. 

The game has hidden menus like improving abilites that if you don't spend to improve these you can end up in a postion where you can't kill mobs. THE GAME DOES NOT DIRECT YOU TO THESE MENUS. The combat is boring aand uninspired your attacks are  on your standard 1,2,3,4 etc hotbar but combos are tied to your keyboard R,T,Y and to do combos something might look like this Play presses 1 then R,R,R,R or 1 then R,T,T,T There is no auto attack so every attack must be pressed.

Overall the experience was not an enjoyable one and I have since refunded [[ My 3rd in my years on steam. ]] and I would rate the game a 4/10 It functions but that's it.

A side note if you delete your 1st character all your bonuses are lost  for your account and  if you have friends on the other side the game locks you to one faction so beware of choosing a side carefully as you could  end up losing everything if you have to delete your character.

Let me start off by first stating that the game is not nearly anywhere close to being established right out of the box as it’s still in early access however with what we got it’s a pretty decent game. The negative reviews are from folks who clearly just do not have the patience for the development of a huge mmo or just simply jumped on the negative Nancy bash the game wagon.

The pros: The story line quest is good and will keep you wondering what the next quest will bring and what it may unlock moving forward. Some English translations are missed but for the most part it does not interfere with the story plot.  The monsters in this game are very well done with all having specific attacks and talents which is a huge plus since mmos are just a copy and paste script that they use. The combat BY FAR is the most fun I have had in a VERY long time. Combos lead to stances switches which then tie into an ability which then tie into self heal or increased cc time. It’s really fun and WILL keep you on your toes. It’s basically FF14 battle system on steroids.  The ability to tame ANY monster in the real world for your own personal pet or mount is a really nice additional and makes the game feel more customized as opposed to generic mounts. The guild system to level up is very nice as well as each level will increase the number of members allowed into the guild. Which makes you really get to know your mates as opposed to having these huge guilds where no one knows anyone. 

The Cons: The class balance system is completely broken at the moment. Right not the paladins and mages are completely god mode and really need to be reworked.  The translation team isn’t up to task as it shows with random words and phrases not making much sense through out the game. More work needs to be done here. The developers don’t really seem to experienced with communicating with there players as some things from the start were not mentioned included in game being left out of the early access portion. Server stability and que lines used to be an issue however they seemed to have corrected this part. Currently no end game at the moment which leaves end game players with nothing much more to do except more low level dungeons and crafting.

My favorite aspect of the game is the taming. What other game lets you find a trash mob that looks really neat and allows you to say ""hey, I want to ride on that demons back now"" and you pull out a scroll and tame it. Apparently, they also have over 600 different tamable enemies in the game!

Tous comme une grande partie des joueurs ayant quitté le jeu, je me retrouve déçu de se portage européen(américain) de Bless online. Après 25h de jeu et un nombre incalculable de bug, ralentissement, et problèmes techniques j'ai décidé d'arrêter l'aventure Bless.

Dans l'ensemble ce jeu peut être viable mais pour cela des point important sont à améliorer :
- Les graphismes sont dignes d'un mmo de 2006, visuellement il parait correct mais c'est sans compter le vide de certaine zone et les obstacle ayant une hitbox 4 fois plus grand que visiible sur l'écran.
- La qualité des vidéos qui clairement font mal aux yeux. Les animations sont rigides, les décors n'ont aucun relief et les jeux de lumieres sont déplorables.
- Coté sons j'ai désactivé les musiques après 2h de jeu donc je ne ferai aucun commentaire.
- le gameplay est pauvre. Les classes possède un arbre de talent concéquent mais ce ne sont que des répétition de compétence. En réalité chaque classes possède aux max 10 compétences unique. A cela il faut rajouter les lenteurs du serveur qui pénalise grandement l'enchainement des combos.
-- Personellement j'ai joué un ""gardian"" et que se soit en phase farming et/ou donjon, l'intensité des combats était mole quant à mon role de tank en donjon c'est plus dans le titre que dans les faits.

En outre plusieurs petits système dans le jeu apporte une richesse qu'on ne retrouve pas ailleurs comme par exemple :
- Les buff de groupe, que se soit pour farmer, pour faire un donjon ou pour monter sont artisanat il est intéressant de former un groupe car grâce à cela on obtient des bonus réfléchie qui aide grandement à la progression.
- Le système antiblocage qui vous permet gratuitement de retourner à votre point de pierre de foyer (parce qu'on se coince souvent dans les décors mal découpé)
- les pets et montures qui permet à tous de choisir parmis le bestiaire du jeu via un système de capture. (les quêtes tutoriel manque de clareté d'ailleurs sur ce sujet)

Bon je vais pas plus m'étaler mais comme tous jeu il y a du bon et du mauvais. et la il y a beaucoup plus de mauvais que de bon.

Cela à beau être un early je me dis quand même après avoir essayé 3 échecs successif, la version européenne serait plus abouti. C'est clairement pas le cas.

Conseil : attendait qu'il passe en F2P pour le tester et faire votre avis. (Moi j'essaye de me le faire rembourser malgrés mes 25h car c'est une honte un jeu comme ça pour 40€)

Stances didnt change anything about your characters stance or fighting style all it does is give you some new skill you can mash with your number keys.

En el apartado tecnico y rendimiento con un ryzen 1600X y una AMD Rx 480 8GB el juego en ajustes altos va a 60fps fijos menos en las grandes ciudades que va a 30fps.

J'aime la façon dont les développeurs mettent tous leurs efforts, et se soucient de nos commentaires en les corrigeant au plus vite. Ils semblent investis et croire dans leur jeu, même après 2 échecs consécutifs, ils ne baissent pas les bras. La boutique du jeu est vraiment  clean et l’Abo non obligatoire pour profiter de tout le contenu. 

Point noir, les performances du jeu sont encore trop gourmandes, une petite config aura du mal à faire tourner le jeu en bonne résolution. La chute de Fps en ville est encore présente mais rien d’insurmontable, des améliorations ont été faites toutefois depuis les premiers jours. 
Il n’est pas encore traduit en français malheureusement ce qui peut être rédhibitoire pour certains mais il  reste assez simple et intuitif malgré tout.

Pour résumer Bless est un petit mmo sympa, qui ne révolutionne pas le genre,  certes, mais qui reste plaisant à jouer. Assez simple dans son apprentissage il peut convenir à tous types de joueurs, vétérans ou débutants et contenter les joueurs Pvp comme Pve. Il ne demande qu’à trouver sa communauté. 

Point essentiel pour moi il respecte la trinité, qui me manquait terriblement et me redonne l’envie de jouer en groupe. Il a ce petit coté old school, qui me rappelle l’ambiance d’Aion à ses débuts ce qui n’est pas pour me déplaire.

Alors franchir le pas ? Je dirais oui, pour 30€ cela vaut le coup de tester soi-même et de faire sa propre opinion.

To start it off let me say i'm rating Bless Online at a Solid 7.5/10.

I'll be saying if I think it's a pro, con or neutral (meaning it's neither good or bad).

(NOTE: These are my opinions and if you want a solid review buy and play it yourself)

(PRO) World Size: The size of the map is about that of GTAV or similar to Skyrim, also taking into account NO LOADING SCREENS. If you want to walk across the map (I don't recommend it) you can without taking time to stop and load an area.

(Neutral) Frame Rate: Let me get a big question out of the way first. I'm running this game 70-120 FPS with a 1070SC with the i7-7700k as the CPU low settings. This game is in early access so as they continue to optimize the game (which they have made alot of progress) frame rate will increase. This game still looks beautiful at low settings and the only time your frames will take a slight dive is when you're loading into a new zone, give it time to load and your frames will stabilize.

(PRO) Combat: The combat in brand new and completely foreign to me, however I was able to pick it up pretty fast after rebinding some keys to make it feel more natural. I recommend playing around with the binds until you find yourself not having to look down at the keyboard to hit a combo. I like this style of combat after mastering it. (slight con: no auto attacks)

(PRO) Progression: Skills and armor come fast at the right times when you need them, along with what you need. Make sure you read what the skills do along with what they turn into. Don't forget to look at your other stance it could fit your playstyle better!

(PRO) Crafting: Crafting in this game leans more toward the ESO side of it (i'm maxed out on crafting in ESO so I might be biased here) meaning you can find the materials you need in the world and you can make whatever you want as long as you have the required items. Enchanting is also a thing all though I haven't really explored it that much yet.

(PRO) Dungeons: Dungeon runs whether solo or with a party can be pretty fun with multiple side quests to pick up for anyone of them. Loot drops are solid and consistent with the level and rate of which they drop. Bosses are solid with not too little or too much healh and they do have some sort of mechanic to them.

(CON) Energy: Mounts and pets both have an energy bar to them that in order to refill. In order to refill the energy bar you have to have them rest (not have them active) or use potions on them to refill it. (in all honesty it isn't that bad but it's there)

(BIG-PRO) Taming: If you want a Друг as a pet you can have one, if you want a dragon as a mount you can tame it ANY THING AND I MEAN ANYTHING YOU CAN TAME you can tame an orc if you want. (it's really fun to tame and level pets and mounts)

Mir persönlich macht das Spiel eine menge Spaß, hat einiges was man entdecken kann, da es eine große Welt ist. Natürlich gibt es einiges was noch verbessert werden kann/soll/muss, da muss ich aber auch ehrlich sagen dass da wirklich dran gearbeitet wird. 
Wem die tastenbelegung zu sehr Fingerakrobatik ist mit der Kombitaste ,,Y"" der kann sich die auch einfach auf eine beliebige Taste legen, da dies in den Einstellungen möglich ist^^
Klar, dass die Geschichte mit dem Damage für nochmal reichlich unruhe gesorgt hat war verständlich, die die 45 sind können sich freuen es wesentlich einfacher zu haben als die leute die nicht so schnell gelevelt haben (Nein, ich gehöre nicht zu den leuten und habe auch damit zu kämpfen), aber so hat man immerhin Zeit sich mit seinem Char, Skills und der Welt zu beschäftigen und auseinander zu setzen und somit, den noch nicht vorhandenen Endkontent ein wenig ausgleichen zu können.
Ich meine, es wäre ja langweilig wenn es so bleiben würde dass man die Mobs bzw anderen Spieler permanent mit 2 Skills umbringt.

The skill combo system is pretty nice and allows for enough diversity to keep the combat interesting. I've tried all of the classes and I'll say that I feel that the ranger is almost unplayable at the moment. Being the only class that I've played that doesn't have a free attack skill or one that generates their main resource, I often found myself just standing there waiting for my resource to use any skills, while I was being attacked. Each battle, with the ranger, left me wanting more from the class and it felt clunky as well. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the other classes. The fluid motion of combat was very nice. The camera movement was a bit clunky as well and occasionally, I'd go through an area where I would hit a severe lag. It usually didn't last long though. Almost as if the game was just loading textures. After the initial lag, even in big cities with several people around, the lag was not too bad. I like the taming system. It allows the player to have pretty much any mount/pet in the game with the option to upgrade them to make them better. Overall, I would say that Bless Online, despite it's flaws, is definitely worth the buy. I bought the base game and cannot recommned the founders packs with the current issues with the ranger and lag. I have confidence that the team will fix many of the issues as the days pass on. They've been very reciptive of the communities thoughts and have made many changes already. That's quite impressive seeing as how the game has only been live in NA/EU for about a week. They continue to make improvements and also perform regular maintenance and sever integrity test/fixes. Bless may not be as visually appealing as BDO, but the environment is visually pleasing. Character creation is very in depth. And though the game doesn't really break any new ground for the MMO genre, I'd say it's a must play and has loads of potential.

- The game plays like a decent enough MMO
- The devs are on it and respond quickly with patches
- The game plays, apart from the weird choices from combo combinations quite good. 
- Dungeon play is also really good.
- Faction based PvP, ow god i love faction based PvP and there is enough! (Old Aion player here)
- Pet/mount taming system 



*Cons
- I play beserker and most combo skills are weirdly placed, they changed the combat which overall is good. 
But you can feel the clunkiness of the combos because they are not designed at first place to be in a combo.
- The game is poorly optimized, even after .INI changes some places it drops down to 30 fps or lower (I7 7700k, 1080GTX) It could be worse though, it is playable. 
- As a melee class you have quite some skills that you need to cast while standing still. While ranged can troll and outrun you. The skills take to long to cast for a beserker to even get to a CC and CC them for a second.

Filas grandes , lag e outros problemas relacionados aos servidores é COMUM DE SE ACONTECER EM QUALQUER MMO lançado, pode não ser o ideal e ser uma experiência frustrante , mas os problemas em relação a isto  já foram resolvidos , em horário de pico a fila não fica grande, podendo se entrar no jogo com 10 minutos de fila. Ao meu ver os pontos fortes desse jogo sao a atencao que a desenvolvedora esta tendo com o game . Em 1 semana de jogo , tiveram mais de 20 atualizacoes para melhorar tanto o servidor, como os bugs, como o balanceamento de classes que sabemos muito bem que eh uma tarefa muito difícil de se fazer com atitudes como essa a empresa esta com certeza comprometida a melhorar o game para todos. Outro ponto importante de se ressaltar eh que o jogo esta em EARLY ACCESS , portanto ele não esta pronto nem muito menos perto de estar, mas ha uma coisa que eu posso garantir , jogue esse jogo em grupo e será uma experiência incrível principalmente na parte de pvp , se voce gosta de pvp ,  este jogo pode te proporcionar algumas batalhas massivas que com certeza prendera a sua atenção por varias horas .",True,1528090229,1528090229,True,0,5,0.521739,True

All the other major issues are covered in other reviews, but I have no faith it will improve because the classes are terribly designed with no depth, and this is after a combat rework. I now see why this game failed in every region, and it's because the classes are so bland that they couldn't possibly hold anyone's interest for long.

You have 2-3 cooldowns and 2 chains you actually use.  a combo chain is just spamming R button for example. That's it. these classes have less depth than a moba champion, and yet they couldn't even finish assassin or mystic before release? that's the least of what they didn't finish, but i digress.

at endgame to boost your gear it's the same old eastern MMO grind. Just cause it's not as bad as BDO doesn't mean it's not grueling.

I don't even reccomend it for someone who just wants 48 hours of a new MMO for the sake of it. the world, professions, dungeons, and the classes are all the most generic things on the market today.


The only thing I liked about this game was the idea of elite spawns being the only way to aquire weapons. it made fighting for mobs fun, and created conflict between factions.

0,119,1,200,200,76561198007308886,0,english,False,42483370,"First of all, I ""think"" there might be potential in this game? I have a lot of friends that have bought this and have been playing since it opened up. But from my perspective, of only playing 3 hours here's what I can tell you on my initial perspective.

The graphics - Ok, the animations can be a bit jerky at times, but overall everything is pretty consistent. I do like seeing decent frame rates over long distances, which is nice and the character animations are generic but good.

Customization - In regards to character creator, I was impressed overall, but I feel like this level of customization is becoming the norm. Certainly the cosmetics will increase by ""official"" release, or in the store (more likely). Gear and items were unique, slightly varying as I level'ed up a bit. I only had about 5 gear set changes, 2 of which fully re-equipped my entire character.

Gameplay - 1+R+R+R repeat 1+R+R+R repeat.... Combo systems are nice, but I feel like there could have been a lot more meat to this. I played as a Guardian, and maybe shame on me for picking probably the most generic class, but they didn't have Assassin available soooo, shame on them.... Anyways, constantly just poking stuff without any real tactical advantage or disadvantage made it dull... I did see a multitude of expansive combo lists as I leveled, but overall, most everything looked to start off with the initial 1,2,3,4 and go to R,T,Y for follow-up. Yay........ It did have me involved only to make sure I was combo'ing correctly, but I wish there was more tutorial on utilizing the skills and how to power them up. Sure, they can choose to not give massive amounts of tutorials to new characters in the beginning but at lvl 11 when you're in a small story instance with mobs constantly spawning on you and your health and damage out-put are not keeping up, they should've informed you that there were means in which you could've buffed up your attacks.

Overall, it's in Early Access, that's fine. But nothing really grabbed me and said ""Your character is awesome, and their story is meaningful, here's why"". And I felt the controls were more clunky than most games. In either case, I feel like I wasted some money, and probably should read more into the ""Mixed"" review rating for this game. It should be taken into consideration when the first 10 reviews that come up for this game are all negative.

Again, I'd like to mention that I had a few friends that are playing this, however, becuase they were in the intial kick-off of the game, they are already well into the 40-level range, and working on alt characters. That was because the developers somehow allowed the dps scaling to pretty much 1-shot most mobs, so characters soared through the levels. That has been fixed, however for all newer players, they will have to do the standard leveling (not so much of a grind from what I've seen) but without the majority of the server population there to be around, it's empty. You're the only one going from quest spot to quest spot, and I'd be even more concerned with having to deal with your first instance where you'd need a group. You would either A, wait around for long periods of time hoping some people of relatively the same level come and help, or B, you could get your super high level friends to roll you through it and not really get to enjoy any challenge at all...

In any case, the game doesn't seem to have much appeal to me, and therefore I would not recommend it.

The combat is refreshing with an interesting skill progression and wow the taming system is just a really fun part of the game!

Long time playing MMORPGs have taught me that whatever the title, launch day will be shaky sometimes rocky, it all goes with the territory. A few stutters and fps drops are not the kind of things I get put off with. I have experienced these in EVERY game that launched and that I went on playing after that. I got stuck on splash screens when ESO launched, same with GW2 etc.....still  played those games and had good fun with them until it lasted.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bless is in a weird spot right now, and I wont judge anyone for wanting to wait a bit before deciding to jump in.

I didn't play on launch day so I can't speak on how that was. However the game has run well enough for me and been very enjoyable so far. Combat feels great playing as a mage with the tab-targerting(I personally prefer it over action combat). There was supposed to be action combat for all classes but it was pulled for all but the berserker prior to launch in order to be refined and eventually re-added.

As for all the complaints about missing content in endgame, they've already said it will be re-added very soon, approximately 2 weeks max. Until then there is still plenty to do, you don't need to full speed rush to 45.

There have been consistent hotfixes and patches over the last few days to fix and make up for the bugs and balance issues currently happening and given a bit of time to smooth everything out the game will be even better than it already is. The only complaint I can really consider as valid is about the translation, it is absolutely horrid sometimes, almost like it was thrown into google translate. Luckily there are already 3rd party skill builder websites that have proper translations so I can figure out what my spells even do. Quest translations haven't been too bad however and I actually rather like alot of the voice acting.

All in all I personally love the game so far and plan to keep playing for a long while. If it doesn't look good to you right now I'd say just keep an eye on it or throw it on Follow and wait until they sort things out a bit more. There is a balance patch planned to drop any day now which should alleviate alot of the issues people are having with low damage.",True,1528073737,1528175312,True,0,6,0.000000,True
0,149,16,2776,2776,76561198050293883,0,english,False,42481220,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW - I will be editing this as things are fixed/changed.

Pros:

- Game is gorgeous.
- Combat is fluid and not too difficult to learn.
- You can tame pretty much anything for pets or mounts.
- Crafting is a more classic, intuitive design.
- Most of the racial stories are good.
- Lots of potential.
- Grouping doesn't feel tedious.
- Community is good for the most part; lots of people trying to group up and/or help each other out.
- Sounds and music are very good.
- Quest logs are very intuitive and make for easy tracking and review.
- You will become addicted to hunting quests.
- Armor and weapons look amazing 90% of the time.
- Responsive dev team.
- Faction character creation lockouts based on population balance on the server.
- Character customization tokens last 24 hours rather than being a one-time shot (you can customize as much as you want in a 24 hour period).
- Several other little things.  Most of the little things in this game are done perfectly, such as your money being account-wide on whatever server you're on.
- Mount animations are spot on.
- You can feed mounts to other mounts.
- Crafting dungeons - these are dungeons where you basically have so much time to gather as many materials as you can.  That's literally the whole point of them, and they are oddly satisfying.
- Very easy to get lost exploring.
- AUTO RUN (I know, I know, BDO had it first).
- Pets and mounts passively level up and give you various boosts.
- Very robust tutorial system.  Holds your hand very well.  DO THE TUTORIALS is what I'm trying to say.

Cons:

- Somewhat poor optimizations (there are several .ini fixes on Reddit that make the optimization not much of an issue anymore, but nothing official from Neowiz).
- Voice acting is hit and miss; the audio recording on the voiceovers is constantly clipping, so voices sound like someone deep-throating a microphone.
- Could use more crafting nodes.
- Respawn timers or mob spacing needs adjustment in some places.
- Balance has gone completely out of wack since the last ""major"" update, both for PvE and PvP.  Some classes need MAJOR work to be viable at end game PvP.
- Dungeon Finder currently takes over an hour to find a group, even if queued as a tank or healer.  I'm not sure this is even functioning actually; I have yet to get a group together using it.
- Difficult for some classes to remain mobile while using skills, which is really detrimental right now after the DPS nerf.  Rangers can easily be killed by only two standard mobs attacking at once if you aren't in an area with room to move (see the balance comment above).
- Many quest bugs - some item drops don't trigger until you've logged out and back in, some interactables don't work, etc. etc.
- Auction House is currently bugged; people are not getting their purchased items.
- Real-money currency is currently only tied to character, not account (this has been acknowledged as a bug, and is currently being worked on.  The team is currently allowing for real money currency to be manually moved between characters via request).
- You can't have characters from both factions on one server.
- Most servers have gone into ""low"" population status since launch (to be expected - I believe server merges and character transfers will be occurring at a later time).
- No mail between friends.  You can only mail to your own characters, but whatever character you're mailing to can only have two unread mails at a time before you have to log into them and retrieve the mail.
- No trading.
- Somewhat frequent server crashes (also expected).
- Skill bars completely disappear on 4K screens when entering a dungeon (this makes dungeons extremely frustrating, as you cannot see your cooldowns).
- Somewhat boggling choices in terms of issue prioritization - among many bugs, a new event and daily quests were added instead of focusing on some of the more pressing issues.
- From what I've seen, endgame is lacking (DUH).  I believe there are only two level 45 dungeons, and one of them is being called ""near useless"".  I can't really comment on this at the moment since I haven't gotten there yet, so take it at face value.


The ""Meh"" - these are things I feel kind of neutral about, but might affect your decision to try the game.

- Each mount has its own stamina bar, and if all your mounts are out of stamina, you have to purchase items to get their stamina back.  Otherwise, you're running on foot (this really isn't as bad as it sounds; once you have around 4 mounts, you can juggle them and pretty much never run out of mount stamina).
- Each class gets multiple stances with different skills.  Each stance has its own resource pool.  So a lot of the game is knowing when to switch stances so you can regen resources on the previous stance.  If you are looking for simple or classic MMO combat, you won't find it here.
- PvP is a BIG part of the game.  Don't expect to do anything past level 30 and not be attacked at some point (there are tokens you can buy that temporarily disable PvP for your character.
- Please keep in mind this is an Asian game.  It will have a higher learning curve and be more grindy than your typical Western MMO, but it's not really awful if you're used to MMOs.
- Profanity filter is currently not working as expected (if you have kids that want to play)
- Not all classes are available yet.  So if you want to play as an assassin, you're going to have to wait.


Honestly, I'm torn as to how I want to rate this game.  It has SO much potential, and is really the most enjoyable MMO I've played in a few years.  But there are some VERY frustrating aspects to this game.  It's still Early Access, and no MMO is perfect at launch.  I'm excited to see this game 6-12 months down the road, but since the last DPS nerf, it's just too maddening trying to solo for me to recommend to all types of players, unless you play a class other than Ranger or Berserker.  There are SO many things this game does right, and an equal amount it does wrong.  Though, even with all the things that need work, I still find myself wanting to play it more.

For now, I'm going to give it a thumbs up because I just can't bring myself to not recommend a game that is this pretty and has this much potential for fun and exploring.  

HOWEVER, I don't recommend the game in its current state unless you are a patient gamer who can deal with some occasional moments of pure frustration.  I'm pretty easy to please, and the issues mentioned above didn't become really apparent until after about 35 hours in the game.  If the devs continue to work hard on this game, and there is proper balance again soon, then this game could become a really solid competitor.

It has been not even a week since its launch and people are expecting a masterpiece out of it while in truth it’s only on early access. You may be thinking “but NeoWiz tried launching it several times before and needs to stop hiding behind the early access facade”, well, it’s their first time on the West and they changed a lot of game features, like the combat system that now is based on combos.

There’s of course a lot of things to be fix, specially the PvP and PvE balance. They even tried to fix a little by reducing all classes damages (which actually fixed a few things but worsen others) but the thing is that they’re trying. They are even making maintenance on Sundays so that the game can be more playable. I think all NeoWiz has the potential of making an amazing game, all they need is time and support.
There’s also the optimization issues that some are experiencing due to the game being made on Unreal Engine 3 (the same that TERA is made of), it uses DirectX 9 which is a little old. But there are some tutorials teaching how to fix your fps and they actually work for most people. 

Another problem is the lack of end game content, but like I previously said, it’s on early access and they even answered this question on a FAQ. It’ll be released on the future, right now they’re trying to balance the game. It doesn’t mean that you won’t have anything to do once you reach the max level. My suggestion is: you can level up other classes; upgrade and capture better pets and/or mounts; maximize your life skills so you’ll be better once more content is out; upgrade your equipment’s to their full potential; make money just because it’s good and why the hell not; do the hunt quests; complete steam’s achievements; among other things.

Pros
- Large, expansive world that looks visually attractive.
- Easy to learn life skills (Armorcrafting, Enchanting, Taming)
- 90% of the mobs in the overworld can be tamed for either a mount or pet.
- Character customization is pretty good.
- Devs listen to a good portion of player feedback and respond fairly quickly.
- Story is interesting and relatively engaging. Can't speak for Heiron but I actually like the main story characters for Union.
- PvP is encouraged when you hit Lv. 30+ but it isn't mandatory. You can use items to temporarily disable PvP if you just want to PvE in PvP zones.
- The game encourages grouping up with people of your faction by including significant party buffs for both combat and life skills.
- Combat takes time to learn, but is rewarding.
 

Cons:
- Game isn't as well optimized as I would like. Most people have to tweak their ini files if they want stellar frames.
- Limited combat style - I personally prefer action combat and detest tab targeting, but unfortunately the classes are locked to a specific type of combat; only berserkers can use action combat, and every other class uses tab targeting.
- Translation is not complete. This makes trying to understand skill upgrades a bit difficult.
- No player to player trading.
- Mailing system is limited - you can only send things to alt characters, and each character can only have two player-sent mails in their inbox at all times, meaning that if you want to send that character more mail, you have to delete the existing mail.
- Forced equalization of factions. This can cause problems if your friends are on a server in a particular faction, but you can't join them because the server will only allow new accounts to join the opposing faction.

TL;DR
If you're willing to stick with this game through its bugs as the devs eventually get to the optimization issues and fine-tune the combat and other aspects of the game, I would highly suggest picking up the base version of this game. I can almost guarantee that you'll get your 30$ worth of enjoyment. If you're not sure about this game and haven't played prior versions, I would not suggest getting anything more than the base package.
However, if you're going to play this game, I would highly suggest you either play with friends, or join a guild fairly quickly as this game does not encourage solo play.",True,1528067392,1528067392,True,0,3,0.487566,True

It has ups and down but they all have meaning and the use of early access is to find and resolve these to ensure the game becomes the best it can be so expect some isses from time to time.
- PvP: first few days were hell due to everyones damage but after changes it is more baanced and pvp is more enjoyable and requires skill - the arena is also very fun with great rewards.
- PvE This game was designed to encourage group play and so far it has the most enjoyable pve i have ever experienced... you cannot brain afk this game.

Alot of people have refunded this game fo stupid reasons without giving it time to actually apreciate what it has to offer and the complexity in its design.
If something is rong then Neowiz goes and work day and night and even weekend to give us a solution and it is usually pretty fast.

Additionally this game has 00000000 P2W (Premium has small benifits that you only need if you craft ad sell or are leveling from mobs and not story: your grinding will only be 20% longer!) so if you want some good gear in game you have to farm/craft or sell your items you can buy with pve points or pvp points. 

Neowiz are a good pulblisher as they are listening to us the community and revolving the game to our needs!
In its current state i belive alot of people wont play however with time this game will over take all other MMO's on the market,

Give it a shot and try to see what it has to offer; by far the best £30 game around comparedd to GW2 and WoW.

Then they made an across the board nerf dropping our attack by 50+% making trash mob grinding a chore.  That should not be the case in an MMORPG.  Most of the fun comes from end-game content where the content is scaled to whatever power curve players are enjoying.  They said they didn't know we would be this powerful ... how is this possible?  Did they not test the game at all before release? I mean, combat was a major emphasis of their development over the past year!  How could they not know?  They said the nerf was mostly for PvP, but in so doing they broke PvE.  I personally doubt that they did not know,  but rather I believe this was a move to make the leveling process longer since most end-game content was (unbelievabley) removed just before release.  They didn't want a huge number of players at end-game with nothing to do.  So I really feel like I was a victim of a bait-and-switch here.

However, if you're looking for a fun MMO that's still evolving to fit the community's hopes, then this is a game for you as it is right now. Literally every day since the early access release, they devs have been doing updates and responding to community feedback. It's great. The game has tons of potential, but it's not exactly there YET.

Pros: Big world! Many tameable mobs for pets/mounts! Dungeon mechanics! Pvp RBG! Chain Attack Combat System (I thought it was unique)! Really customizable combat builds!

Cons: FPS flux (some manual tweaking necessary for optimizaiton). Limited gear selection. Limited end-game content. Combat balancing is still under process. Occassionally inconvenient bugs. Still in development overall.

I bought the game on its first day available, 28th May but I only started playing it on its early access launch due to server crashes and loading screen bugs. You may be thinking “this is terrible, how are you giving a positive feedback even with that happening?” Well, it’s not happening anymore because NeoWiz seems to be trying to fix these major problems and is actually succeeding on doing it. There’s of course a lot of things to be worked on like classes balance, pvp and pve balance which is a major setback but we can clearly see that they’re working towards it. There’s a lack of end game content but it was actually informed on a FAQ months before the launch, it’s only an early access game.

People may say “NeoWiz needs to stop hiding it behind an early access tag because they already tried launching this game for the fourth time” but you know what? The tag is there and it is indeed an early access. Forget about the other launches because they’re trying to implement a lot of different resources. They failed on the other launches and are trying to do it different here so have some patience, we have a lot of mmos examples that were really bad on their launches (like TESO, FFXIV and even WOW).

People complain about bad optimization due to the game being made on Unreal Engine 3 which used Direct X 9, I have a decent setup and I’m not experiencing these problems. People with high end computers are complaining but there are a lot of tutorials about fixing the fps, just follow it if you’re having those problems.
Another complaint right now that I already talked about is the lack of end game content, just have some patience. You can still do a lot of things after reaching the max level, like taming pets and increase their rarity, try to get their best skills; upgrade your equipment to the max possible (I think it’s +10, not sure); maximize your life skills so you can be even better when more content comes out; making money because why not; finishing all the hunt quests; getting steam achievements done; etc.

O jogo é bom, possui uma ""inovação"" no sistema de combate com chains e uma arvore de skills ativas/passivas ao qual acaba dando singularidade ao seu personagem; 

Se por exemplo você é um Mage, em jogos similares , voce seria um mage como qualquer outro [spoiler]agua, fogo, terra, arco-iris.. [/spoiler],  já no bless , vc consegue ser um mage elemental com variações diferentes, e unicas do seu personagem, por exemplo, mage/tank:  um mage tank com mais vida, ou com mais mana , ou com mais critico.. etc.. e isso nao se aplica somente a um estilo.. 
  
Vi um comentário em umas das analises negativas dizendo [strike] "" se vc quer ser um mage .. nesse jogo nao tem pot de mana, tem que esperar 3 hrs pra encher novamente.. mimimi.."" [/strike] - [spoiler] de verdade, eu senti uma raiva interna ao qual se eu pudesse, dava umas porradas num animal desses que mal abriu o game e começou a dar rage quit. ¬¬' [/spoiler]

[strike] Respondendo ao mimimi [/strike], há sim a possibilidade de recuperação de mana ao mesmo tempo que se dá damage, skills/chains que ao serem utilizadas revertem parte/ou todo o dano em mana.. [spoiler] Era só ler o complemento da primeira skill , mas pelo visto ele nem ler sabe. ¬¬' [/spoiler]

enfim , voltando à analise; O jogo tem muito a melhorar, otimização em certas partes da cidade/mapa, cutscenes, renderização de texturas e por ai vai; lembrando que a Staff está se mostrando assiduamente ativa, então, creio eu que 99% dos problemas serão resolvidos nos futuros patchers;

Bless Online é de longe um game ruim, [spoiler] essa mecanica de capturar e domar quase todos os mobs do game é sensacional [/spoiler] , saiu da mesmice clonada dos jogos atuais, trouxe mecanicas exóticas e até o breve momento não é pay-to-win [spoiler] da para se fazer tudo sem a necessidade de pagar vip ou comprar lumenas, até pq vc pode farmar elas dentro do próprio jogo...[/spoiler].

OVERALL SCORE: A-

For this review, I have identified the following evaluative criteria, and assess them below.

1. Monetization and Optimization Efficiency (+/-)

For the various prices one may buy to play Bless Online (ranging from a $30 minimum and an over $100 maximum), the first couple of days were rocky. There was a problem loading the game, which was apparently due to server capacity of a large influx of players. It is also the case that player base has dropped, suggesting that either Bless did not intend for so many players or it was unprepared, and it cost the game players. However, the issue was resolved in about 2 days. Those two days were for those who paid for founder packs, which barely anyone was able to play. Developers provided compensation. The game seems to be running smoothly, with fewer optimization problems. The game is relatively worth the money. 

2. ""MMOness"" (+)

There is a large player base, and with the new nerfs to damages (some of which are excessive, though) player cooperation is increasingly more important, driving home the ""MMOness."" There is room for solo play and traditional farming, but as you increase in level, player cooperation becomes more important. This is not a game for people who want to solo and do not like strategy and challenges in PVE or PVP. 

3. Responsiveness of Developers and Staff (+)

The developers and staff have shown to be responsive in fixing issues in a timely manner. They were charged with an onslaughts of reviews after the damage nerf, and have provided updates online, discussing the future of bless. They hear their players. (+)

4. Player Community (+)

The player community is, surprisingly, not that toxic. There's a small handful of your ego-bytes, but the group of folk playing are mature, interested in the game doing well, and helpful.


Overall, I gave the game an A-, as I believe the first two days were particularly unprofessional and caused a player base to leave the game. While there are still plenty of players, the more the merrier. I would encourage players who have left, to keep working on the game with us.

Good job, Bless Online!

The truth is that the reviews you will see here are being skewed by a lot of people who are grouchy about a bumpy launch and technical issues.  Are they correct?  Yes.  

As someone who has played MMOs since Everquest first launched, I have memories of far more brutal EQ expansion launches and people threatening to end their love of that game forever.  And yet they didn't of course.  It was beloved.

The point is technical issues can affect the enjoyment of a game immensely (or stop it completely), but as long as you get a sense they are being worked out, you need to move on to looking at the core of the game and deciding if it is for you. 

So addressing just a bit of the technical stuff first, here are my notes: 
 
- Like many, I have had fps issues that I really shouldn't with my system.  Other users have posted various fixes, and I have had to make a number of tweaks to different settings to get things playing well.  While I now have things working smooth, this really shouldn't have happened at all. And this is a bummer.

- On a more postive note, although technical issues have caused a number of emergency patches right away, the dev team has been quick and responsive, and they have even given compensation for down time.  
Overall feeling about technical issues: No lasting issues that will stop me from playing.

As to the actual core of the game:
Bless is most like WoW played on a PvP server if everything was sylized to look a bit more like a cross between Tera and BDO.
Combat is tab targeting, but with stances and combos that try and up the excitement just a bit. 
If you have been on the lookout for a new MMO that feels comfortable in the way WoW did - you will probably have fun.
If you don't like PvP at all, you probably won't.
If you only like action combat, you will probably feel frustrated a bit.

Perhaps the most unique / newer aspect of the game is the ability to ""tame"" virtually anything you come across to be either your mount or your pet. Instead of collecting outfits like in some games, you just may find yourself collecting a zoo in Bless.",True,1528049060,1528049060,True,1,0,0.000000,True

Overall -    I am enjoying the game even with its flaws. You cannot make everyone happy.

- Pas vraiment de contenu pvp type battlefield, qui est rajouté au fur et à mesure, les zones qui y sont dédiés dans la carte du monde sont immenses, l'entrée des donjons est souvent campée ce qui amène a des combats de groupe. 
- Développeurs réellement impliqués dans le jeu et qui ont envie de bien faire, maintenance assez fréquentes (environ 1 par jour) afin de rajouter du contenu et de réparer des bugs, et qui écoutent les envies des joueurs et en font des retours sur twitter ou par les émissaires, très bonne chose. 

- L'optimisation laisse à désirer en fonction du pc, le jeu tournant sur directX9, vous serez avantagé avec un Windows 7, mais ce n'est pas vraiment la faute du jeu. Quelques mini-freeze lorsqu'on ouvre une interface, rien de vraiment dérangeant cependant. i5 4670k et gtx 1070, je tourne en mid/high avec 60 fps. 
- Système de déplacement un peu déconcertant : Caméra à la FF14 (clic droit enfoncé pour se déplacer), et votre personnage esquive automatiquement les obstacles sur la route pendant les trajets. 

Bref, jeu très agréable, l'univers est beau et varié, les développeurs rajoutent au fur et à mesure du contenu en fonction des attentes des joueurs, le pvp semble assez skillé, pas vraiment stuff-dépendant, et (pour le moment), aucun p2w dans le jeu (l'abonnement premium n'est VRAIMENT pas obligatoire, les bonus sont minimes). Jeu avec un très bon potentiel donc. Je recommande vivement !

Absolut tolles Spiel mit gut durchdachtem Kampfsystem und Entwicklern, welche sich ernsthaft Gedanken um Spielerfeedback machen und Wünsche der Community innerhalb von wenigen Tagen umsetzen. (7 Patches und Fixes in 6 Tagen). Entwickler lehnen P2W strikt ab.

Positives:

-gute Grafik
-stimmiger Soundtrack (Hans Zimmer war beteiligt...mehr muss man nicht sagen)
-genial guter Charaktereditor
-gute Klassenauswahl (Guardian, Berserker, Mage, Ranger, Paladin)
-riesige Auswahl an Mounts und Pets (660 Arten, die gezähmt werden wollen)
-viele Dungeons zum Start des Early Access
-ganz Wichtig: momentan fairer Shop - ohne P2W-Elemente

Negatives:

-Balancing zwischen den Klassen ist im Moment eher suboptimal (wird aber gefixt)
-Kampfsystem wirkt stellenweise träge (Input-Lag beim Auslösen von Skills)
-Landschaften teilweise leblos (NPC's wurden teilweise entfernt - aus Performancegründen)
-ausbaufähige Spielperformance (Memoryleak, Framedrops - wird wohl über kurz oder lang besser)
-Serveranzahl meines Erachtens zu hoch (Stichwort: 7 Server sind im Moment zu viel - Serverzusammenlegungen wären angebracht)

This game received so much hate from the community, so is it really worth it? After researching more, I decided I should try this game and see what happens; I was not disappointed.

The graphics are stunning. So many beautiful landscapes... everything looks so real! It's one of the very few MMOs with a medieval setting that make you say: ""I feel like in the Medieval Age!"".
The combat is relaxing, but can make your fingers a bit.. confused. The chain system is quite fun and the visual effects of the abilities make some of them look so satisfying(such as killing your enemy with a meteor or putting an enemy in chains).
The stories(the main ones and the side-stories) are interesting and allow the characters to grow.
The devs are some really cool guys! Not only they actually listen to our feedback, but they also implement the desired changes. Of course, not all the time things go smoothly, but that's why they immediately move towards fixing the problems. They're also keeping a close relationship with us, the customers!

In the end, this game is worth its money and is lots of fun! Of course, it has its problems(no game is perfect), but that shouldn't stop you from getting it.

Alors je viens poster ici afin de réhausser un peu les dires et les evaluations négatives ...

Malheureusement le jeu a été victime d'un mauvais démarrage ( bug serveurs et lags )  et d'un 1er patch assez radical en matière en d'èquilibrage ... 

- Niveau bug serveur je suis désolé mais à la sortie d'un mmorpg , AUCUN jeux exsistant n'a eu un démarrage top ! Alors on peut venir dire "" il est sorti en Asie et en Russie il y a X années bla bla bla "" , il faut savoir que ce n'est pas les mêmes serveurs et que l'attente d'autant de joueurs n'était en rien prévue , ils ont essayer de dépanner avec des serveurs complémentaires mais ça n'a pas suffit !

Ils travaillent très vite sur leur problèmes et on peut dire que l'équipe est au taquet afin de faire le nécessaire . Mais trop de pleureuse qui ne savent pas tenir 2 jours sans jouer et vont crier sur tout les toits que c'est de la merde ( un beau reflet de la société actuelle ... )

- Il y a eu un patch un peu trop "" cru "" diminuant dragstiquement les dmg afin que le commun des mortels de OS plus tout , ils ont un peu exagéré mais encore une fois ca va etre changer ds max 1 semaine ! Mais encore une fois , Kevin ne peut plus OS tous les mobs du jeu donc ca ne plait pas car il va falloir utiliser un minimum son cerveau .

En dehors de ça , le jeu est très plaisant , la communauté in game polie et mature ( ca change des Moba et FPS ) , bcp d'entraide . Il y a pas mal de choses à faire , le jeu va être amélioré et je pense qu'il est très prometteur ! il est toujours en EA donc je le conseil aux gens patients et qui ont l'envie de participer à l'évolution du jeu , pour les autres , attendez la version finale parceque sinon ca va pleurer encore dans les jupes de maman et sur les forums à outrance ...

Bless is no doubt still rough around the edges but the developer are listenening and are truly invested,
performing updates/fixes almost every other day. The game has a lot of potential and the combo combat system
is really nice (think Aion with more customization and choice). The communication from the DEVs to the Community is good
and there is a very healthy population online almost at any given point during the day.

If you do not rush to max via Hunt groups then you will find yourself enjoying the game much more.

Don't listen to anyone other than your own opinion about what you think about the game. Specially if they 100% hate it and begging the rest of us to refund because they didn't like it.

Watch some videos and streams and decide for yourself if it's worth 30£. Don't ever let anyone else decide what you think or not. You can always try it and then refund later, it's not that hard.

But for me personally, i'm having fun with it, even with it's flaws, because i know that a game like this have huge potential, as long as it's allowed to grow.

It's not like Revelation Online, where my.com completly fucked up the game themselves... and it's not like Wildstar where they haven't had a single meaningful content update in years... and it's definitly not like Black Desert Online, which have basically 0 PvE content and fucked up p2w mechanics (or rather, so much inconvinience that if you dont buy a value pack or some weight limits, then youre just screwing yourself).

They are doing 100% everything themselves (eg not relying on a seperate publisher) and haven't lied to us once. They may have been some hicups in the translation and may have left out a few details here and there, but there hasn't been a day where they haven't tried to work everything out. I can't remember the last time you can tell that has ever happend, specially in todays market. Specially with 0 p2w aspects.

So for the last few words, i'd say this: If you aren't 100% certain that you are gonna like this game, then wait. Just wait a few weeks, months or even until next year. They will eventually get everything right and we will have the content we where promised to have.

0,213,34,983,983,76561198042976298,0,english,False,42473377,"Early access Launch
Let’s start at the beginning for this and work our way forward. Launch was bad but not horrible there are some games like wildstar that did worse but Launch was plagued with download errors, launcher errors, game crashes, long queues, and various other problems mainly caused by steam. One of the major issues at launch being lack of adequate server support at this phase was quickly taken care of by adding more servers which was a good move on part of the developers allowing more people to get on and play the game.

Founder Packs
Now comes the Can of Worms to open, The Founder Packs first off there are many things that need to be done differently about this to begin with they need to make founder pack benefits available on all characters. The next thing they could do differently is reimburse founder packs for people who’s characters got deleted. The Saving grace of this issue is while the collectors edition once cost $199.99 bucks they listened and reduced the price to $149.99 in that regard the developers listened to the outcry over the founder packs in some regards now they need too listen in others.

Emissary Choices
Lets face it there is not much to save them on this issue… First off their choices for the Emissary program were bad in general focusing on people with super large audiences over their actual fans who streamed. I will not call out names here however many of the streamers they chose did not meet one of the major qualifications for the emissary program they did not feel passionate about Bless Online. Neowiz’s Choices for emissary were evident that they were looking for those who make the most noise and can pull in large numbers but sadly those same streamers did not care about bless online, many of them did not play mmorpgs or even rpgs in general.

The Cash Shop
They did a lot right in this regard gonna say that right now. One of the things they did right is the skins are clearly cosmetic only with no stats, the choices at launch I saw on my Female Mascu few but High quality Among the ones that stood out to me I saw A Cute Looking Frilly Dress, a bad-ass looking leather overcoat, and a white wolf with a snow particle effect when it ran around. For functional items I saw character slots, inventory expansions, Extra Tactic Load outs, and  things of similar nature off of which were acceptable.

The Gameplay
Bless Online’s Gameplay appears good overall with a solid combat system that favors scoring Higher combos for more damage encouraging people to use both stances with each other to extend their combos higher for more damage. The story seems pretty strong while having the Hieron side focusing on putting the deposed prince back in power while the current emperor runs the Hieron Empire’s good name through the dirt, At the same time you have the Union side dealing with attacks from the a mysterious group clad in red masks trying to destabilize the Union and you try to put a stop to their plans. The crafting system seems to work well picking between 3 main crafting classes (Armor smith, Weapon smith, and Enchanter) and 2 sub crafting classes (alchemy and Cooking).

Combat Update
The combat system Caused a god nerf with an 80% damage reduction which is a bad move overall but the saving grace of this is they are working on fixing the combat and putting more focus on skill chaining.

I found a rock golem while questing and decided to tame it. I named him George. After spending quality time with George, riding on his shoulders, he managed to reach level 10. George and I went everywhere together. We continued questing until the main story quests were finished, we rode into battle together, and we shared some laughs. ""Haha, classic George!"" I would say. However, dark times were ahead of us on our journey. Then, on that fateful morning, George and I then decided it was time for George to receive an upgrade to a blue grade mount. George said he was confident in achieveing rare grade mount status. Afterall, he had 9 upgrade attempts. Although I was reluctant at first, I knew this was George's true wish so I oblidged. Sadly, George did not make it through the process. He failed all of his upgrades. As George's last quest, he was then fed to the superior Basilisk mount that did succeed the upgrade. George's death was not in vain. He will not be forgotten.

However, the hunt for George II continues.

Habe lange auf das Spiel Bless gewartet und viele Artikel drüber gelesen, als das Spiel dann endlich Released worden ist, habe ich mir sofort das Spiel gekauft.

nach ca 1-2 Stunden im Spiel habe ich mit den Gedanken gespielt das Spiel zu refunden, weil mich die Disconnects, laggs und Loading Screen bug einfach nur genervt hat.

Zudem das, dass Spiel nmicht auf Deutsch war wie angegeben....doch danach dachte ich mir gibst dem Spiel mal etwas Zeit, weil eigendlich jedes MMO am anfang probleme hatte ....

nun Mittlerweile habe ich 57 Stunden Bless auf der Uhr und kann nur dazu sagen

- Keine Laggs
- Server sind Stabil
- Open PvP nervt nicht weil das Pvp Protect item fast nix kostet 
- Jeden Tag kleine bis Große Updates und Hotfixes
- Entwickler gehen auf wünsche der Spieler ein!
- Es wird einfach nicht langweilig, weil es immer etwas zu machen gibt!
- Habe eine i7 7700k (5.1 GHZ) und eine Gtx 1080ti oc dies betreibe ich am 34 Zoll WQHD Monitor (meine Fps im Spiel über 120+ Fps ausser in der Stadt da komme ich auf 70-80 Fps)

aber natürlich gibt es auch negatives zu Berichten ( aber wo gibt es das nicht?? )

- nicht auf Deutsch bis auf Video untertitel ( gabs von Neowix eine entschuldigung für, das Sie es nicht rechtzeitig 
                                                                        geschafft hätten)
- Viele Inhalte sind noch nicht im Spiel z.b der Assassine aber komisch das die Set Parts für die Klasse droppen^^ 
- Action Camera feht....hatte gefofft das es wie Tera Kampfsystem wird...


noch ein Letzten Satz bevor ich mit meinem Review abschliesse...

Ich denke man sollte dem Spiel Zeit geben, klar ist das Spiel schon lange in Entwicklung und hat in 3 Ländern gefailt aber mein Gott Die Entwickler haben das Spiel nicht in Sand gesetzt und versuchen alles besser zu machen. Ich denke denen ist auch bewusst wenn die jetzt in Eu/Na auch failen dann war es das mit dem Spiel endgültig somit legen die sich echt ins zeug. 

Ich verstehe halt nur nicht diese leute die irgendwie lvl 3 mit dem Spiel aufgehört und das Spiel refunded haben und dann ein Review verfassen, obwohl die garnichts vom Spiel gesehen haben.....

so, hoffe mein Beitrag hat euch geholfen.

Stripped off tons of content from the Korean and Japan versions, thus lacking severely in end game pvp and pve. Also missing loads of advanced character development, specializations and progressions. Classes like ranger and berserker suffer the most as their most crucial skills aren't in game yet. Other clesses are lacking their alternate specs, like tanking ability for paladins. Unsure if devs intend to steer gameplay away from original or stick to it, hopefully its the latter because multiple specs for each class is really needed. Mystic and Assasin not in game yet, core classes, ridiculous why it aint in.
Teen rating means a couple of game content were removed and harsh censorship, some quests removed as evident by quest markers that cannot initiate quests, censorship in chat etc.
Balancing needs a lot of work. Nerf to dps is a good start but poorly thought out as PvE suffers. Am hoping the nerfed dps stays at least in PvP, we don't want the 1 hit kills PvP from launch, its stupid.
Combat needs a rework or overhaul, combo & stance system is unique and interesting but it slows gameplay down a lot, not the speed but the pace. Getting your combos broken and your stance and skills on cooldown means you're doing nothing till cooldowns are up. Crowd control is insane, really need to rework this. We have immunity but with its many limitations(i.e. cannot use skills and move or very short duration) and the huge amounts of CC skills, its a stunlock farkfest.

I enjoyed the leveling experience until they completely gutted damage and made hunts/quests worse exp than just sitting in town and crafting. Seems like they wanted to slow down leveling so people wouldnt get bored at 45 with no end game content.

The obvious optimization issues causing even mid-high end PCs to get massive frame fluctuations.

Abosultely horrendous class balance. Mages running around spamming one skill and auto-winning against most classes. Tanks going more damage, more CC, and more mitigation than damage classes. I got a beserker to 45, only to find out that it's pretty much the most useless class in the game right now. No damage, short cc that ends before animations end, long animation locks, buggy gap closers, ect.

So by now everyone knows how terrible the launch of this game was, so i'll skip over that as you can read about it in over 2k reviews. Besides the downfalls of the launch and optimization issues the game is farily good. 

The combat is fairly unique even though we don't have the full combat system in game with the action combat choice. Some attacks lock you into place and some don't, depending on the abilities and combos you use, which makes you have to think about when to attack to try to avoid any avoidable damage. overall not the best comabt system but fun specially now with some changes they have already made.

The story is a bit bland and from what I have been told they have cut a lot of cut sceans or edited them for the western audiance to make a teen rating. Sort of a bummer but I am not into the story of bless too much.

The non-combat systems are fairly fun if you'e a fan of such things like crafting and taiming.  crafting if pretty standard but as of now it doesn't feel like you can gather a mass quanity of mats which makes it last for now.  The taiming system on the other hand is really unique, as you can tame MOST mobs in the world as a pet or a mount.  You also have to tame multiple mounts and pets to try to upgrade the ones you really want to higher quality and unlock abilities for them. There are items that you can help the success rate of upgrading but I do think you wont get a lot of them unless you want to spend real money int he cash shop.

I am not a PvP player so I cannot ratge the PvP system, but all I hear from my guild is it's a blast.

The PvE side of things seems pretty standard, theme park MMO style questing, but you can get level locked out the quest line if you don't do all the side quests and partake in dungeons and hunting quests.  Hunting quests are given to you on the first kill of a mob if they have a hunting quest to go with it. They offer ok experience, but the real reward is dungeon points, guild xp, and gems you can dismantle for crafting mats.

Overall the game is actually good now that the servers are stable and if you take 10 mins out of your life to do some tweeks to some ingame files to help the optimization issues. (I know we shouldn't have to but it's worth it really) Also the biggest thing that has kept me playing since day one of head start to this early access game is the devlopers.  They completly messed up every step of the way with the launch, but they have admitted theyu messed up and every day when i come back home from work there are new patches, fixes, or balance changes to the game. In my eyes that counts for a lot, as most devlopers would have just taken their money and called it quits. So as long as the devlopers keep up the hard work to fix their mistakes and listen to the community as they have so far then this game will end up being great by the time of it's offical launch. YES I know Bless has been launched in 3 other countries, and people say they are using the ""early access"" title as an excuse but it is an early access game, as the devlopers have intended for some time now.

An Honest Review on Bless So Far

In the midst of all the negativity on the game right now, I'd like to post my own honest point of view of my experience with the game so far. I currently have a max  lvl45  guardianr   if that is any indication on how much I've played.  

Combat = 8/10. Arguably the best part of the game. While it may seem like it's just a disguised, watered-down tab target system, it really does feel fun to play. The combo system is incredibly engaging and combat overall feels very impactful.  To anybody who says that the combo system is restrictive on what you can do with your class, I'd say that's a valid observation but I disagree. The combo system feels intuitive, and there is plenty of options in combat to choose from. More so than I can even remember.

Character Customization = 8/10. The character customization is  Deep rreally  Deep! you can customize yourr ass off  one step down from black Desert online. its Dope. Black desert  9/10  

Class Customization (Abilities) = 7/10. This is wherre it get real technical. I thought it was rreally simple but as i got better and understoon the game i realized therre arre dozens of combos.. This  is where the high end players will seperate themsleves form the trash players.  it may ""appear"" to be simplistic.. Its not. the fact that you can switch stance and mid combos switchto another branch is what is going to make you hit the next level of performance trust me.. its deep.. if you just spam  ""R""  as an example you are not learning yourr class . this is something a ton of non Exp MMO players arre misjuding bless for. They Dont have a clue how to be good at their class.

Performance = 4.5/10.   Majority of the FPS problems in the game were related to the massive influx of players, and when you changed channels the FPS gain was pretty significant because no one really knew how to change channels or knew that you could since the game doesn't tell you. There is some FPS fixes floating around  the FPS gain was only decent . Maybe 15 more but on the minimum FPS not maximum mean in it helped me not fall below 60 much . pretty good  FPS, Definitely going to need some improvement. (update perforrmance has imprroved afterr updates)

Graphics I = 9/10. The open worrld is  amazing looking. Bottom line. it rreally pushes this highly modified unreal 3 engine. lush open worlds and is prrobably one of the most polished points of the game 


Sounds & Music = 7/10. The sounds and music in the game are probably up there on some of the better things in the game. I had the in-game music on the entire time I played and it was very relaxing and sounded pretty well done overall. The sounds of the effects of the game are average. Nothing revolutionary, just average. Skill effect sounds are probably the best part of it, and makes combat abilities have a bit more ""oomph"" to them. Voice acting however was pretty cringe, but it wasn't nearly as bad as Blade & Soul's VA was and other Eastern games. orr shitty Aion.

Animations = 8/10. Definitely some of the best skill animations of any UE game I've played so far though.  The skill/spell effect animations are pretty dope, and it definitely makes some of the classes have some eye candy tied to them. I was pleasantly surprised with some of the spell effect animations and how cool they were, especially for a UE game.

Translation = 1.5/10. Easily the worst part of the game  I honestly have no clue how the translation that is currently in the game got through to   launch, but it's honestly Terrrible. I have no idea what majority of my skills do because the translation is so bad, and not to mention quests can be really tedious too because of it as well. I can't blame people for being turned off from the tutorial because it gives you a first look as to how dogshit the translation is. This is something that can be improved on in the future though relatively easily, so I don't really think this is something fundamentally important as performance is.

Overall = 8.5 / 10

In it's current state it's hard to recommend it to anyone - but almost everything wrong with it can be fixed with future patches.

[b]Current Issues[/b]:

[u]Optimization[/u]
Bless, has very horrible optimization issues, where I got from over 100fps and drop to 10 - 12fps on the lowest settings. There are some fixes by editing .INI files, but with a 1080ti and i7 7800k I should not have to. 

[u]Translation[/u]
During the game you may encounter confusing translation errors:
In the tutorial I got a quest where I had to equip a '[b]Poison stance skill[/b]' I spent 15minutes reading my skills over and over trying to find anything that has [b]Poison[/b] in the name, I even screen shared with my friend to see if I missed anything, I ended up equipping any random stance skill and completed the quest.

Or when you level up you may get a message saying 'YOU'VE BECOME 5LEVEL'.

[u]Balance[/u]
on Day 1 and 2 you could pretty much speed run the entire game and run dungeons solo.
Now classes have been nerfed to the ground and it feels like you need a team to do even the simplest task. 

Despite all the issues with the game it has Early access for a reason.

0,228,6,4431,4431,76561197988920390,0,brazilian,False,42470920,"Bless online é um MMORPG de mundo aberto com foco no PVP, feito na unreal engine 3 possui belos gráficos, um sistema de combate diferente baseado em combos e com a premissa de permitir batalhas em larga escala entre as facções.

Pros:
-Mundo aberto, hoje em dia é difícil achar um MMORPG com um mapa tão grande e livre para exploração.
-Gráficos bonitos, os gráficos do jogo são consistentes, tem um estilo interessante, não nível BDO mas que outro MMORPG é?
-Customização, a customização do personagem é bem variada.
-Combate, o novo estilo de combate é bem interessante, requer a atenção do jogador para manter o combo e realizar a troca de estâncias para adquirir bônus de dano, defesa, etc.
-Não é P2W, até o momento dessa análise o jogo não possui nenhum aspecto P2W, os itens no shop são cosméticos ou de conveniência, variam de skins a expansão de inventário e boosts de exp, além disso é possível trocar pontos obtidos in-game através de PVP ou PVE por lumena o cash do jogo, sendo possível trocar até 60 lumenas por dia.
-NEOWIZ, até o momento eles parecem se importar com a opinião dos jogadores, sempre ouvindo o nosso feedback eles tentam melhorar o jogo lançando updates rápidos.

Neutro:
-PVP livre, o foco do jogo é o PVP então a partir no lv 30 nas áreas do mapa que são disputadas os jogadores podem atacar livremente a facção inimiga, inclusive são incentivados a fazer pois o PVP dá ótimos recompensas. O lado negativo do PVP livre é que pode dificultar para jogadores que querem se focar mais no PVE, até o lv 44 os jogadores podem utilizar um item que desativa o PVP, dura 10 minutos com 10 minutos de cooldown mas no lv 45 o item passa a ser adquirido apenas com lumena (cash), mesmo sendo barato, apenas 25 lumena, o item dura 10 minutos mas passa a ter cooldown de 20 minutos.

Cons:
-Otimização, sendo o maior problema do jogo, a otimização do jogo é péssima mesmo utilizando as alterações nos arquivos .INI, principalmente nas maiores cidades apresentando quedas de FPS absurdas, péssima utilização da GPU chegando a míseros 20-30%.
-Balanceamento, as classes atualmente estão totalmente desbalanceadas.
-Bugs, o jogo apresenta alguns bugs, muitos já foram corrigidos mas alguns ainda podem atrapalhar a jogar.

Conclusão:
Assim como todo MMORPG o lançamento é uma bagunça, filas para entrar, bugs, problemas de performance e balanceamento, todos esses problemas estão presentes em menor ou maior grau em todo lançamento, Bless online não é diferente, não teve o pior lançamento mas também está longe de ter sido o melhor porém o diferencial é que a equipe de desenvolvimento está atenta ao feedback dos jogadores e agindo de acordo para arrumar os problemas e isso é uma coisa para se valorizar.
Eu recomendaria Bless online para aqueles que gostam de MMORPG, tem um dinheiro sobrando e não se preocupam em ajudar a testar e melhorar o jogo afinal é para isso que serve o Early Access. Para quem não tem paciência para isso ou não quer gastar o dinheiro sem ter mais certeza da qualidade do jogo recomendo que esperem mais algumas semanas para ver como o jogo evoluirá.",True,1528034987,1528035097,True,0,1,0.000000,True

0,23,2,3099,3119,76561198056871001,0,english,False,42470721,"I will be fair and look at all angles of the game and try to explain things with many play types in the mix. While I am personally loving the game, I realize it is not a game for everyone and with it being in early access there is a lot to fix that remains. While I love the game and recommend it for anyone who is well aware this game is still a work in progress, I want to be honest and up front with my opinions on the game and help people on the fence decide if it is for them. 

Let me start off by saying, yes it was rough in the beginning. Honestly, I've been through so many EA that it was expected even though they brought the game over from Asia. It was not nearly as bad as some of the survival games EA I've been in. I was happy about the response time from Neowiz on the issue and it runs fairly smooth for me without having to edit .ini and all. As a note I do have a higher end gaming machine that runs ARK smoothly, which is a complete beast of a game with it's lack of optimization. I feel like if I can run it on Epic I could run anything. You may experience different performance than me based on your machine and may have to do all the edits to the .ini.  

I still experience crash outs now and then, especially when flying places on wyverns and ships, but I trust they'll iron it all out eventually as they've show me they are working on it and other bugs. They are far less than they were day 1 and they're consistently doing maintenance to the servers to fix bugs. I also feel their communication has been pretty decent, especially compared to some other games I've been a part of. So many people want things done RIGHT NOW and then complain when they are not done immediately. If you're one of these people, Bless and EA in general is not for you. It takes time to fix bugs, issue and balance. Patience and understanding are the key to any EA game.

It is true the combat is nothing to super write home about at the moment. It's mostly tab targeting except for Zerker and is rather static like old MMOs. A lot of people are addressing this and giving them feedback so hopefully we'll see this change in the future. While I myself don't mind the old style tab targeting one bit as it's a form of nostalgia for me of days healing in older MMOs like WoW. I can also understand this might be a turn off for a lot of people who are newer to MMOs and used to BDO type combat. 

Balance of PVE gameplay is a little messed up at the moment, but again, it's a new game for the western market they are trying to balance it differently to the different market that they had previously. As with any MMO, give them time and they'll sort it out. They've already stated they are working on this issue as well and should have more patches for it this coming week. (I will update when they patch it.)

I find quests to be fun and the main story line to be engaging. They have your standard go here kill this and go here gather this quests as well as hunt quests for dungeon points you can use in the cash shop. It's nice to take a break and clean up the trash every now and then. Especially while waiting on friends to move on in the storyline. It means you're never stuck just twiddling your thumbs. You can kill and get rewarded or craft. 

Crafting leaves a little to be desired at the moment for me. I took enchanting and alchemy. Enchanting gives you taming scrolls, which I thought would be amazing for myself and friends. However, you can't currently trade with your friends... which REALLY stinks. My fiance, Dad and I all took different professions and would love to trade items with one another so we don't have to spend ALL our money on the AH, but this is not currently possible. You can not mail or trade other players. I'm hoping perhaps they'll add mailing to those in your friends list, or a guild bank type deal in. SOMETHING to let us give items to our friends and trade gear we get with friends and guildmates. This is probably my biggest complaint with the game at the moment. I understand they are trying to keep gold farmers at bay, but you'll never completely discourage them... they'll always find a way. On the subject of crafting I also feel it currently takes way too many stone to craft lower end taming scrolls. This should be reduced as it is difficult to gather enough to make for yourself and sell unless you spend 6 hours gathering stone. It doesn't always drop from stone nodes and when it does you only get one stone per node... it takes 9 stone for a 35 and below taming scroll. I gathered stone for an hour and only game away with 46 stone and could make 5 scrolls. It is painfully grindy and slow.

Taming is not difficult and I love the fact they give you buffs and that you can tame your own mounts. I've had a lot of fun with this and while it's similar to the concept of Riders Of Icarus, it still stands this MMO apart from others in my opinion. I could personally be biased towards this though as I do love any game with taming or collection. 

As for the game itself and artwork, it's on Unreal Engine 3 so if you're looking for modern warfare game graphics or something super realistic, this isn't the game for you. The art itself is subject to opinion, but I personally like it and find creatures, costumes and scenery to be lovely. Though, I played wow forever in college and was never bothered by the graphics or style there either, so it's all just personal opinion. 

The last thing I'll address is the party system. This is possibly one of my favorite things about the game. I LOVE the fact you can choose various buffs for your party based on members and all. It has introduced me to a lot of fun and friendly people that I otherwise wouldn't have met. The social aspect of the game is here and other than the haters/naysayers that will die off within the month as they move to the next game, it's a good and helpful community. I enjoy chatting with others in the channel, in parties, and that I meet. 

I can not currently comment on the PVP as I have yet to participate and admittedly am not a huge PVPer. Once I get around to trying it, I'll update my review. 

Overall, if you're willing to be a part of the development of an MMO and enjoy traditional style MMOs this is a highly recommended game for you. If you're on the fence about something give the game a try for an hour and a half. Steam will let you refund it if it is below 2 hours and the best way to really know if it's for you is to give the combat and all a try. I am enjoying my time in the game quite a bit and giving my feedback to the devs as well as watching it get ironed out and grow.

Quel dommage que le jeu ne soit au niveau !

Bonne histoire, graphisme suffisant et musique plutôt sympathique
L’idée des montures et de compagnons est formidable

Pourtant je m’amuse mais je reste sur ma faim sachant que le jeu n’est pas prêt et là le manque de professionnalisme des développeurs me met en rage.
Pourquoi investir en temps et en argent dans un jeu pour faire de la « merde » des vrais Fans/développeurs talentueux qui n’attendent que ça de trouver un travail et pour participer à un jeu comme cela on n’était pas à trois mois prêts il est où l’amour du MMO quand voit ce genre de résultat.

The Bless is a game that i was waiting for a really long time. As AION player that started to play from headstart and played 6 years till Gameforge destroyed the game, im back in the world that i love. Lots of open world pvp without any limitations like karma aka BDO. Yes, Bless isnt so nice like BDO and combat need still improvement and fixes, but overall its fine and fun. Give it a time and get used to it. Taming system is great idea, its fun to roam the world on monsters that you normaly kill and watch other players that has their own pets and mounts. Once there will be Action combat option for all classes, fixed bugs, rebalanced classes and added endgame content, more ppl relalize that refund was bad idea and will buy game again. 

Summary:

Pros: 
- Nice world
- Open world PVP ( Faction vs Faction = no limitation )
- Taming system
- No P2W ( actually )
- Challenging combat
- Hybrid action combat ( once released for all classes, only Berserk atm )
- Music
- Devs are not silent and hear community ( updates and fixes every day till now )

Cons:
- Performance ( need to use INI fixes )
- UI need some improvements
- Old engine ( UE3 - not so shiny and nice like modern games, but still good )
- Translation ( skill tooltips are not good atm, but they already fixed some )

So far so good. Give a Bless chance, dont reject after few hours and spend some time in, you will like it.  Bless Ya ! :)

Bless je hra na kterou jsem cekal opravdu dlouho. Jako dlouholety hrac AIONu, ktery zacinal od headstartu a hral 6 let nez Gameforge hru domrvil, jsem zpatky ve svete ktery miluji. Spousta pvp v otevrenem svete bez omezeni, jako napr v BDO. Ano Bless neni tak pekny jako BDO, combat potrebuje porad doladit a opravit, ale celkove je to dobre a zabavne. Dejte tomu sanci a zvyknete si. Ochocovaci system je skvely napad, je zabava projizdet svet na monstrech ktere normalne zabijite a sledovat co si ochocili ostatni hraci jako pety nebo mounty. Jakmile bude Action combat dostupny pro vsechny classy. budou opravene bugy, rebalanc class a pridan obsah pro endgame, tak si vice lidi uvedomi, ze refund byl spatny napad a budou si hru opet kupovat.

Souhrn:

Pro:

- Pekny svet
- PVP v otevrenem svete ( Frakce vs Frakce = bez omezeni ) 
- Ochocovani monster
- Zadne P2W ( aktualne )
- Vyzivavy combat
- Hybridni action combat ( jakmile bude vydan pro vsechny, zatim jen Berserk ) 
- Hudba
- Vyvojari nedelaji mrtve brouky, poslouchaji komunitu ( doted denni updaty a opravy )

Proti:
- Vykon ( potreba si upravovat INI soubory )
- UI by potrebovalo par vylepseni
- Stary engine ( UE3 - neni to tak pekne jako moderni hry, ale porad dobre )
- Preklad ( popisky skillu nejsou v tuhle chvili dobre, ale nektere veci uz opravili )

As a non MMO gamer my review is based on having NO expectations and NO comparative views with other MMO's. I have however been playing in the past D3, Divinity 2, Kingdom Come, Fallout, Skyrim and For Honor. 
For me the Graphics are impressive without being mind-blowing. Only small temporary issues with FPS skips when loading new areas and starting the game. The art style and Asian influenced art are something that I am fond of and is well done here.
The main storyline is serviceable and varied enough. Nothing too new or innovative be not much different than most other game storylines. The side quests are interesting, numerous and are of the same level as most others.
UI and translations are perfectly fine. Nowhere nearly as bad as how other people have overexaggerated. Only very minor and rare translation errors that have no effect on the game at all.
Gameplaywise it has all the elements of other games such as crafting, enhancing, mounts, professions, dungeons and questing  
Fighting is where this game shines for me. Playing a ranger is as close to playing a Demon Hunter in D3 in a MMO as I could imagine. Initially it feels clunky and fumbly but once you become more skilled in dexterously pushing buttons, combos and planning moves ahead there is a great feeling of satisfaction.
Obviously, this game is still early access so there are things yet to be refined or implemented such as market, end game etc but I’m sure they will come. So far they have provided patches which have improved the game.

Lange gewartet und ich muss sagen es hat sich gelohnt, bis auf die Performance ist es ein schönes MMO gewurden mit einer sehr freundlichen Community die das Spiel auch sehr stark verteidigt! Was kann man zu Bless sagen, entwickelt von NEO WIZ, hat sich ewig seit gelassen und wird sich hoffentlich entwickeln, Es gibt 2 Fraktionen mit jeweils 3 Rassen (1 Rasse ist Fraktions unabhängig) also insgesamt 7 Rassen. Je nach Rasse kann man sich bestimmte Klassen aussuchen wo auch wieder die Fraktion eine rolle spielt. Fraktion ✔ Rasse ✔ Klasse ✔ dann gehts auch schon in die Charakter erstellung wo man echt eine große vielfältige möglichkeit hat sich seinen Charakter zu erstellen, Ob man nun sich einen Dicken bärtigen kleinen Typen erstellt oder einen Großen Muskulösen Berserker das steht dir frei. Im Spiel angekommen gibts erstmal ein kleines Tutorial was bei manchen für Stirnrunzeln sorgt :D aber dazu nicht soviel ... . Weiter gehts dann mit den ersten kleinen Quest und man kriegt einen einblick in die wunderschöne Story und dann gehts los, viele Nebenquest wo man schnell mal vergisst seine Hauptquest zu machen da man auch EP für Hunt-Quest kriegt und das nich grade wenig. Im großen und ganzen ist Bless ein schönes MMO geworden und bleibt es hoffentlich auch (Buff Berserker PLS) daher spreche ich eine Kaufempfehlung auf jedenfall aus!",True,1528020180,1528020233,True,1,2,0.000000,True

 I have played for over 60hours currently and i do not write many reviews, i am not a commissary. I just feel like sharing my thoughts with those of you who have yet to decide.

Before Bless came out in NA/EU i expected very little from it. Based on what i had seen from their bad trailers, failed versions in Russia, Korea and Japan. Then there was the so called conference, that was not so great lets be honest. It's safe to say my mind was almost already set on try and refund. 

However once i got in and played it for 2 hours. I found the game was fun to play (for me) It had/has a lot of issues, and a lot of work left to be done. Most issues can be fixed easy enough. My main concern is the developers themselves, they make decisions that impact the entire community with little to not thought imo. I am not so sure they are up to the task. I feel as if they don't know what their doing or what they are trying to achieve at times. It's as if they are trying to sabotage themselves. I've not yet lost faith in them completely but i am concerned. If anything will kill this game imho it will likely be how Neowiz handles these crucial 90days.

Time will tell if they are up the task i suppose. For the time being if you are someone who is looking for an MMO with Open world pvp and have a clear understanding of Early Access. Bless Online may just be the game for you. The combat is actually fun. Once you understand how the combos work you can get creative on how to kill things/people in pvp. And yes things are indeed in need of some serious balancingin in pvp(22222) and pve(22222). So don't go in expecting too much and you may find what you need to keep you busy for awhile.

Performance wise the game is not great. But thanks to our great community solutions have been found. Ini tweaking has made the game playable for many people including myself. The only thing that may keep some of you away at this point, is lack of content. If you have nothing to play right now i encourage you to at least consider Bless.

In closing Bless Online is a game with a lot of potential. All it needs is a little support from us, some content from the developers and it may just live long enough to become a full game SoonTM.",True,1528018660,1528018660,True,0,1,0.000000,True

Launch: Admittedly a very rough and unstable launch. Many issues. Many bugs. A lot of unfinished localization. Bugged quests. Optimization issues. Much more than a handful of problems. 

Now here is where this game won my respect. A few hours into launch the game received its first hotfix and patch. I can't think of ANY other dev team to begin addressing issues and start the ball rolling on fixes. Multiple fixes were released day 1. 

Day 2: Noticable difference in FPS and stability. Still many serious issues, but communication from the dev team is consistent. Overall still not a stable game. 

Day 3 and beyond: Stable connection. Queues are nearly cleared up. Still needing a lot of work optimization-wise. Devs still consistent in their communication and releasing fixes. Almost all of the issues that were present are either cleared up or in the works. 


Overview: As with any game, yes there are issues. Yes balancing needs to be, and is being, addressed. Devs are very active in their efforts and communication. In my opinion, these guys are invested and will be working hard to balance everything and get the content released. The negative reviews that i've seen are mostly short-sighted and extremely whiny.

Ich weiß auch ehrlich gesagt nicht was alle Leute sich hier in den Reviews erlauben zu schreiben, das Spiel hat seine Ecken und Kanten das ist wohl klar, aber dieses rumgeheule über ein Spiel was im Early Acces ist seit ein paar tagen muss echt nicht sein, das Spiel macht viel Spaß und man sieht das der Entwickler immer weiter versucht das Spiel zu verbessern, ein Balance wird derzeit versucht zu finden, alle klassen hatten einfach zuviel schaden gemacht, das hab selbst ich zu meiner klasse gemeint das es einfach Dumm ist wie man durch einen Dungeon rennen kann ""Alleine"" und alles mit einer combo weg hauen kann. Nun ist es wenigstens so das man überlegen muss und nicht blöd mit dem kopf über die Tatatur rollen kann.

Oyunda özellikle şehirlerde optimizasyon sorunu var fakat bunu config ayarlarından birazcık düzeltmek mümkün. gtx 1080 ve 2k monitör ile şehirlerde min 30 fps alıyorum. Diğer alanlarda fps düşüşü olmuyor oyunu ortalama 60+ fps de oynuyorum. 2k çözünürlük için oldukça iyi ama bunlar için config ayarlarını yapmanız gerekli.

Oyun Erken erişim oyunu oyunda classlar arası denge , hasar vuruşları gibi bazı problemler mevcut bu 43+ dungeonları yapmanızı engelliyor. Çünkü son güncelleme ile bütün classlardaki hasarlar düşürüldü fakat pve olarak mob ve bossların canları düşürülmedi. Bossların üzerinde bir buff var ve 3 dakika içinde kesmeniz gerekiyor 3 dakika içinde kesemezseniz boss herkese tek atmaya başlıyor. Bu şekilde oyun şimdilik biraz kısır döngü içine girmiş durumda fakat yayınladıkları duyurularda class denge ve hasarları 2 hafta içinde çözüceklerini söylüyorlar.

Akşamları bazı serverlara girmek için sıra bekleyebilirsiniz çünkü oyuna ilgi yüksek her ne kadar ilk 2 günkü gibi bir ilgi olmasa da Na ve Eu olmak üzere oyunu günlük 25k-35k arası kişi oynuyor. İstatistikleri biraz araştırıp bulabilirsiniz.

Oyun size diğer oyunlardan + olarak hiç bir şey sunmuyor. Oyunun grafikleri bdo kadar iyi değil çünkü bu oyunu oynayan insanlar oyunu grafikleri için değil klasik bir mmorpg olduğu sebebiyle oynuyor. Oyunda dungeon mekanikleri çok zor değil öğrendikten sonra dungeonlar rahatlıkla yapılabiliyor. Oyun benim için %25 PVE %75 PVP ibaret.

Oyunun geniş bir haritası var ve bu haritada pvp yapmak çok eğlenceli open world pvp dediğimiz olay bdodaki gibi 2 kişiyi kesince karman düşmüyor tamamiyle karşı ırktan istediğiniz kişilerle savaşabiliyorsunuz. Karşı ırkın bölgelerine gidip pvp yapabiliyorsunuz. Oyunun pvp içeriği çok geniş karşı ırktan insanları öldürdükçe combat point kazanıyorsunuz bu pointlerle mağazadan bir çok şey alabilirsiniz.

Oyunun Pve kısmında ise yaptığınız dungeonlarda Dungeon point kazanıyorsunuz. Bu pointlerle exchange office menüsünden Lumena ile takas edebiliyorsunuz. Şimdilik 20 dungeon point 1 Lumena yapıyor ve günde max 50 lumena takaslıyabiliyorsunuz. Eğer premiumunuz var ise bu sayı max 60 lumenaya çıkıyor.

Ülkemizde doların önü kesilmediği için gerçek para ile Lumena satın almak birazcık pahalı steam oyun paketlerini kendi kurundan hesaplasa da lumena ve premium fiyatlarını kendi kurundan hesaplamıyor. Fakat oyunun cash shopunda alıncak bir şey yok. Cash shopta kostüm ve 1 saatlik çeşitlik exp buffları bulunuyor. Oyunda seviye atlamak oldukça kolay exp bufflarınıza ihtiyacınız bile yok. Yine cash shopta çantanızı geliştirmeniz için eşya satılıyor fakat bankanıza her büyük şehirden ulaşabildiğiniz için bunu satın almanıza gerek yok. Üzeriniz dolduysa x şehirdeki bankaya eşyalarınızı koyup y şehirinden alabilirsiniz.

Oyunda karakterlerin becerileri ve savaş sistemi çok farklı henüz class dengeleri tam oturmadığı için insanlardan bazıları şikayetçi fakat oyunu oynayan herkesi mutlu etmek mümkün değil. Oyunda mage classını oynuyorum diğer classlarla ilgili bilgim yok fakat mage classında 4 adet seçebileceğimiz Stance combo skill bulunuyor. Bunlar sırası ile fire , ice , air ve mixed olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Toplamda 6 tane var fakat biz şimdilik 4 adetten sadece 2 tanesini seçebiliyoruz. İlerleyen zamanlarda diğer 2 stance combo skill de açılacaktır. Becerilere ek olarak karakterlerin Non-stance skilleri mevcut. Stance combo skill ve non stance skill kısımlarındaki becerileri geliştirmek için farklı puanları kullanıyorsunuz. Stance combo skill için sapphire kullanırken non stance skill için Rose Stones kullanıyorsunuz. Bunlara ek olarak her classın farklı yetenekler bölümü mevcut bu kısım da lvlınza ve puanınıza göre belirli yetenekler var ve siz bunları karşınızdaki tablodan sırası ile açabiliyorsunuz. Oyunun yetenekler ve savaş sistemi kısmı oldukça geniş bunlar zaten %50 lik kısmı denilebilir.

Oyunda birazda topluluklardan yani guildlerden bahsetmek istiyorum. Guildin seviyeleri var ve seviye atladıkça guildinize daha fazla üye alabiliyorsunuz bununla beraber bazı bufflar kazanıyorsunuz. Bu buffları aktif etmenize gerek yok bu bufflar aktif olarak üzerinizde bulunuyor. Guildin ulaşabileceği en yüksek seviye 15 ( yanlış olabilir ) ve bu seviyeye yaklaşık 6 ayda ulaşılabiliyor. Guildin hızlı seviye atlaması için birlikte hareket edip hunting questleri hızlıca yapmanız gerekiyor. Hunting questleri bitirdikçe siz dungeon point , craft yapmak ve silahınızı yükseltmek için bazı malzemeler kazanıyorsunuz. Bunları daha kısa sürede kazanmanın yolu yok gibi gözüküyor.. Bu yüzden guild sürekli toplu hareket ediyor. Açık haritada olduğumuz için pve yaparken karşınızda karşı ırktan bir grup bulabilirsiniz ve pvp yapabilirsiniz.

Oyunun en sevdiğim yönü ise yapımcı ve yayıncı firmanın aynı olması bu sorunlara anında müdahale etme fırsatı sunuyor. Biraz mmorpg geçmişi olan arkadaşlar ne demek istediğimi daha iyi anlayacaktır. Yapımcı ve yayıncı firma farklı olduğunda oyunda oluşan sorunları çözmek oldukça zaman alıyor çünkü yayıncı firma bunları yapımcı firmaya bildiriyor yapımcı firma konuyu inceleyip çözüm üretmeye çalışıyor ve bu zaman alıyor. Yapımcı ve yayıncı firma aynı olduğunda ise sorunlar 1-2 gün içinde çözülüyor.

En başında da yazdığım gibi oyun Erken erişim oyunu oyunda bazı sorunlar var ve başka sorunlarda olucaktır fakat ben oyunu oynamaktan keyif alıyorum ve en önemlisi açık harita pvp sistemini çok beğeniyorum. Bu yüzden iyi bir sisteme sahipseniz ve açık haritada da pvp yapmayı seviyorsanız kesinlikle denemelisiniz.",True,1528016776,1528017431,True,1,6,0.595277,True

Certes en dessous de mes attentes, il propose une contenu assez solide.
Les plus : 
- Equilibrage assez propre en PVE (depuis le nerf des dégats des classes), parce que oui marre de ces jeu ou il est possible de rush des instances solo sans soucis !!
- Beaucoup de contenu intéréssant notamment au niveau du craft.
- Enfin un mmo avec une vrai map ouverte ! (même si certaines zones sont inaccessibles)
- Aucun bot (pour le moment et pouvu que ca dure !)
- Communauté assez présente et pas de gros clash internations !
- Le shop est certes abusé mais n'offre pas d'items qui avantagent ceux qui laissent leur rein dans les MMO 
- Neowiz a bien réagit concernant le début archi caothique de l'early early access en compensant très favorablement les acquéreurs des packs fondateur.
Les moins :
- Même si ma config me permet de faire tourner le jeu à fond sans avoir de gros drop de FPS, pour une jeu qui a déjà qqs années pls revoyez les graphismes qui sont carrément inégaux et surtout ne valent pas mieux que certains jeux qui ont déjà 10 ans voir plus !!
- Beaucoup de BUGS (qui sont corrigés au fur et à mesure mais tout de même), ne me dîtes pas que c'est un early access svp parce qu'on le sait tous, si on nous annonce un early access c'est pour justifier ce genre de connerie mais 6 mois d'early access ça n'est plus un early access mais une enculade propre qui déculpabilise NEOWIZ de tous les problèmes de leur jeu.
- Manque de stabilité des serveurs.
- Le jeu n'est pas très intuitif et nécessite de passer par la boutique pour que la prise en main se fasse dans de bonnes conditions (extension d'inventaire HYPER cher et quasiment indispensable !)

Often apples are compared to oranges. e.g. comments like, there are free access games like BnS, Tera for example. But these games cost more than 30€ on release and BnS is not comparable.

Or comments like ""I couldn't play with my people on a server. Yeah, if not everyone gets what they want within the first hour then the game sucks. That makes sense... If these people had had some patience, unfortunately children rarely have, they could have switched to a new server a few hours later in a group.
Just as many who thought they had to open their founder pack right at the beginning... why is one so damn stupid? You never do that.

To the game: The world is designed with love. The questing is quite fun. It's not too much complexity in the crafting system, which I find very positive. no housing so far, I also find very good - has bothered me at BDO/AA - as a sandbox.

Attention- Important: Play this game only if you know you are joining a group. You won't have any fun solo unless you like pokemon. :)

So far there is not much to say about end content, what is there is enough for casual players rstmal. The hardcore gamers, who I personally don't like, because they destroy every game by their addiction - yes addiction, go to the doctor and get a job - for them there is of course not enough, because they could level too fast due to a mistake of the publisher and are already lvl 45.

Apart from this advantage, the game is good to play so far, you should only know that you change the control from the beginning, for movement and fighting as this is not EU/NA friendly control.

The graphics are great, although I think they could be tweaked a little more. The game play is good, I wouldn't say it's great, but its definitely entertaining. The combo keys are something I will need to work on, as it's not very comfortable to launch an attack with #1-3 and then use R,T & Y to kick off combos.

Some GOOD elements:

- Very nice character models, skills effects and animations

- Combat feels good but it can be improved further (Good if you like tab targeting, if looking for ""action"" combat look elsewhere)

- Good taming system. Many mounts and pets to catch and upgrade.

- The most important thing imho, NOT P2W (as of now).

Some BAD elements:

- Very BAD optimization out of the box. FPS is quite unstable. Requires manual .ini file changes to improve FPS (Still not great tho)

- Graphically dated and unimpressive areas/zones.

- NOT END GAME content is available as of now.

- Bad localization (text translation).

Ich verfasse mein Review, um den zahlreichen Mimimi Posts von irgendwelchen Leuten etwas zu entkräften, die immer noch denken dass wenn sie 30 € in ein Spiel investieren, dass ihnen dann die Spielewelt gehört. 

Damit ich euch nicht mit einem riesigen Text wie die Hater und Toxic Gamer zuspamme, deren Inhalt oftmals falsch oder völlig übertrieben dargestellt ist, gebe ich euch eine Pro und Contra Sammlung in kurzen Sätzen weiter. Jeder der MMO wie WOW liebt und sich etwas mehr Action wünscht, Tabtargeting nicht abgeneigt ist und es liebt Tiere zu zähmen ist hier goldrichtig. 

PRO: 
- Schöne Grafik mit tollen und grossen Städten
- Tolle und stimmungsvolle Musik
- Tolles Combosystem mit sinnvollen Verbesserungen
- Dank der Nerfs vor 1 Woche sind die Spieler endlich gezwungen sich wie in einem MMORPG zu verhalten und Gruppen zu bilden (Alle anderen sollen Offline spiele zocken wenn sie in keine Gilde oder Gruppe wollen)
- Geniales Tamingsystem mit grossem Sammelaspekt (Ihr könnt sehr viele Reittiere und Pets erhalten, diese leveln und erhaltet dann spezifische Verbesserungen für Berufe, PVP oder PVE Situationen. GENIAL :o) 
- Geniales Gruppensystem wo man je nach Klassen und Grösse Buffs aktivieren kann für Instanzen, PVP oder auch zum Sammeln. So lohnt es sich immer wieder Gruppen zu sammen zu stellen. 
- Nicht für alle Positiv: Allgemeine EU Server wo die gängigsten Sprachen vertreten sind. Gibt massig Deutsche Gilden als Ausgleich. 


CONTRA: 
- Viel PVP ab Stufe 30 das man nicht wirklich umgehen kann
- Man muss kleine .ini Verbesserungen vornehmen die auf Reddit aber hervorragend beschrieben sind, um FPS und Widescreen Monitore optimal zu nutzen. (Samsung 49"")
- Floating des Charakter wenn man ""ungewöhnliche"" Wege beschreitet. 
- Alle können alles Sammeln, was gerade im PVP für ordentlich Zoff sorgt ;o) 
- Die Hunting Quests sind manchmal etwas zu too grindig. Töte 10, dann 20 bis zu 100 von einem Tier. (besonders ärgerlich wenn viele andere die gleiche Quest machen wollen: BILDET GRUPPEN oder ladet diese Leute ein)
- Berufe sind allgemein bis Stufe 30 schwierig, weil man nicht so recht an die Mats kommt. 
- Zähmen benötigt Rollen, die man gegen eine horrende Menge von Stein herstellen muss. 
- Kein Handel zwischen Spieler möglich, was den Hauptaspekt des MMO schädigt. Ein Marktplatz mit festdefinierten Preisen ist Kacke, weil man kann niemandem etwas ""GUTES"" tun. 

Schlusswort: Die meisten ""GamerDeppen"" verlassen das Spiel zum Glück wieder. Zurück bleiben die hilfsbereiten Leuten und Gilden, bei denen man gut unterkommt. Irgendwelche Roxxor Kiddys gehen auch wieder und somit spielen sich die Instanzen sehr gut. Das PVP ist extrem spassig weil man nicht mehr mit 3 Hieben einfach umkippt. Stellt euch auf sehr verbissene PVP Kämpfe ein, wo ihr bei jedem Kill erleichtert durchatmed. Combos müssen wohl gesetzt sein und interrupts und snares gut angesetzt. Auf jeden Fall ein Spiel wo nicht nur Buttongesmashe zählt. Das Spiel ist jeden Cent wert und ich geniesse das Spiel von Stunde zu Stunde immer mehr, bald habe ich 40 Stunden hier verbracht.",True,1528010352,1528010352,True,3,11,0.467184,True

0,55,3,3171,3171,76561198147033908,0,english,False,42463394,"Bless Online is a wonderful, solid game covered in layers of absolute garbage. That is best way that I know how to describe Bless Online. I have so far spent about 30 hours in the game and have been enjoying it immensely. Having said that, I cannot recommend spending the thirty dollars unless one wishes to support the development team. 

The game at its core feels solid. Combat feels good, questing is pretty standard, and the pvp has been fun so far (I've only reached 34). It's been really fun playing this. What makes the game ""bad"" is the stuff that isn't a part of the game. FPS issues, which require a .ini fix, some bugs which have now been fixed, and somewhat poor handling of the community by the pr department. On the whole, it leaves a poor taste in the mouths of a lot of prospective players who expected better and didn't receive it. 

Should they have gotten that? Well yes and no. The game is in early access, which I see as a message from the development team saying that their game is not ready. And it isn't. The real question here is, how much change should players expect? I think that a some players came into this game with the expectation that it would be almost complete, and it very clearly is not. Again, I need to mention FPS issues here, but there are other little signs as well. There are plenty of completely empty spaces within the world, which make me believe that Neowiz planned to fill up. However, the one thing that makes me facepalm is the lack of a half decent settings menu. There is a settings menu, but it is far below the standard. In order to turn off things like motion blur, one has to go into the .ini files. Why Neowiz couldn't put a decent settings interface in their game is something I will never know, but I hope that they do put it into the game. In fact, if their settings menu was up to par  at launch, I expect that a lot of players would have been able to get decent FPS despite the poor optimization. I doubt that most players would expect to have to change .ini files, and probably quit without ever trying the fix. I've seen some players in game state that they get 60 fps post .ini fix, but that is not something I can verify is widespread. My own cpu is rather weak.

Others seemed to expect a perfect mmo launch, which is something I don't believe has ever happened before in the past. It's a surprise to me to find that players don't expect queues on a launch day. Terrible launches have been a part of mmo history, and I don't see that changing, and nor is it relevant today as launches only come once. Even if it has helped ruin the game's reputation.

The largest issues before the game ever came out was combat, and I'm happy to say that I have been enjoying the combat. There are now six stances of which a player can choose two. Stances determine skills and combos available. At any time, there are 18 separate combos available to the player, which can be switched up by equipping a different stance. I quite like the system, as it's something that hasn't yet been tried in a MMO, and is quite fun. The developers do still need to adjust combat numbers. Once the developers tweak the combat to the point they like it, I think that it will be quite good.

Another aspect I've been enjoying is the pvp. The only thing I don't like about the pvp is that it uses the same damage modifiers as the pve, which is going to make balancing the two difficult. Other than that I've been enjoying myself with it despite being only level 34 atm. 

The other thing I like is the taming. It was a bit of a shock realizing that if there was a cool mob in the world I could tame it and make it one of my pets. Since then, I've been trying to collect a few of the skins I like to level them up. 

The cash shop has been overshadowed by a lot of the other issues with the game, and rightly so. The game isn't going to be worth playing. It's endgame is pvp, and with the fps issues, that is going to be a problem if they aren't fixed. But I like it. If a player plays long enough, he or she will be able to buy anything that they want off of the cash shop by spending dungeon and combat points. These points can be converted into lumena currency, and although it will take a while, someone can purchase a premium skin if they grind enough. As far as p2w goes, I don't see any problem with the cash shop.

Bless Online deserves a lot of critisicm, but I am of the opinion that a lot of the vitriol that the game has received on its early access launch is excessive. The game is by no means the ""greatest game ever"", but neither is it absolute garbage either. If Neowiz can polish up the games little things like FPS issues (which admittedly is actually a big thing), translation issues, and just other little things, then the game will be above average. It won't ever be the best of games, but it will at least be worth playing. Until then, I don't recommend investing in the game unless you can forgive the testing and balancing that they are doing as well as the current lack of features. Despite that, I have been enjoying myself, and will recommend it to any who can overlook its shortcomings as expressed in this review.",True,1528007995,1528007995,True,0,4,0.485135,True

*Stuck on loading screen, which mean people had to restart up to 20 times to get into the main menu.
*Queues up to 2k people.
*Servers offline.

The 10 euro i had the pay more for the headstart didn't feel worth it.

After 4 days i bought the game again. Joined a different server, as the one i joined first was still marked as full.
After 6 hours of game play it feels more stable. No crashes so far, neither did i notice any stuck on loading screen issues.

Em um mercado tão dominado por cópias de cópias é importante reconhecer que Bless Online não é só mais uma delas. Bless Online é uma nova tentativa de trazer de volta os mistérios, os perigos e as emoções de um tipo de jogo que só quem experimentou os primeiros anos de World of Warcraft e Lineage 2 pode comprovar. Importante também entender que Bless Online não está pronto, mesmo com seus anos de estrada na Coreia, Rússia e Japão, a versão NA está ainda numa fase de alpha para beta e, até o momento, a velocidade dos desenvolvedores em buscar e aplicar soluções aos problemas tem sido satisfatória. Os sérios problemas de FPS e renderização praticamente sumiram e,  de fato, dezenas de milhares de pessoas já estão jogando Bless Online horas seguidas, completamente imersos em um novo universo de MMORPG. Os servidores estão lotados. Sim, há problemas técnicos, mas estes são superáveis e solucionáveis, no principal – seguir a proposta clássica de uma MMORPG – Bless Online é realmente uma bênção. Então, não dê muita bola para as críticas ruins. Leia também as críticas boas, assista os vídeos ao vivo, as ""lives"" no Youtube e no TwitchTV, preste atenção nos detalhes.

Early access means that I do not expect it to be perfect.
 
This is an Early access MMORPG that NeoWiz has released and are making drastic changes to the original Bless Online that was released a while back.

These changes will cause the game to have some bugs, glitches, and potentially positive outcomes in months from now, not today or tomorrow, months... These potential positive outcomes will be possible from players who play EA and provide positive feedback. ""POSITIVE FEEDBACK"" not like most of these negative post where people expected this game to be perfect when its an Early Access game or when changes they don't like occur.

I have to say that NeoWiz have been awesome at listening to players constructive feedback about the game play and are contently reviewing bugs and glitches. 

They post daily updated in the Bless Online discussion forum on Steam and make as many small maintenance as needed to get the servers optimized for all players to enjoy. 

Before you buy, Ask yourself?
- Do you like to play Early Access games?
- Do I want to help provide NeoWiz with constructive feedback to make the game better?
- Do I Expect things to break and have to wait for it to be fixed?
- Do I expect things to change due to Early Access?
- Do I like to play with others?
- Do I like a challenge?

This game overall makes my graphics card seem fucking terrible. I ran on low quality and I still get shitty and somewhat laggy gameplay in combat. These dirty developers say they ""see"" their customer concerns but they don't. Everyone complained how bad the combat was which I somewhat disagreed, I could understand why people don't like tab targetting. 

They said they listened to our concerns about balancing the combat but what did they do? They didn't fix it, THEY KILLED IT by making mobs even harder to kill. The dev's balance team is terrible and must be smoking some 12 dollar ganja on the topic of ""balancing"" the game. These guys are money hungry trash that hyped up people saying they are ""listening"". They aren't listening to SHIT.

First, the game launched with damage and healing power(s) completely out of whack.  OBVIOUSLY WAY out of whack.  The game should've never seen the light of day with stats that out of balance.

Then your kneejerk reaction is to do a blanket nerf to power, and buff healing power.  Ok, that needed to be done.  But you WAY overdid it ON LAUNCH WEEKEND.  You made this game significantly more frustrating than it had to be on what is literally the best opportunity you will ever have to reel in new players over a two day period.

You needed to test that change before you made it.  Or, in light of making a smart decision, NOT dump a MAJOR change to the game on LAUNCH WEEKEND.  The powers needed to be adjusted, but low level encounters should not be the place to increase challenge, especially when all your customers are now playing your game, at low levels, ON LAUNCH WEEKEND.

You need to do better, and you need to do it quickly.  Escuses don't matter, you only get one launch.  It doesn't matter how tired you and your team are, etc.  Nobody cares about anything but what happens next in gaming.  You should've done better before you launched.  You're reacting quickly now, which is good, but this patch is going to cost you tens of thousands of players because you didn't bother to QA the change on low levels and made the early game a miserable, tedious experience.

TL/DR  - You rushed a much needed change without understanding the scope of the fix.  You did this on launch weekend, saw the backlash immediately, and did not bother to revert the change so your new customers wouldn't get furious at the tedious early game and walk away.

Die Probleme mit den Server am Start waren meiner Meinung nach auch zu erwarten, was sehr viele Leute allerdings abgeschreckt hat.

Ich habe zurzeit 2 Chars auf lvl 35 und 1 auf 36 und habe nun meine richtige Klasse gefunden.

Durch den Damage Patch gestern ist es allerdings extrem Schwer seinen Charackter von 1 auf 25 zu bringen was für eine menge von Leuten Problematisch werden kann.(Fixes Dazu sind für anfang nächste Woche zu erwarten)

Allerdings schafft der Patch es PvP ""weniger"" Frustrierend zu machen da man nun nichtmehr einfach so 1-2 schuss und Tod ist sondern endlich eine Chance hat sich zu währen.

Als ich die ganzen schlechten Reviews gesehen habe wurde mir selbst Mulmig und ich habe etwas meine Lust am Spiel verloren allerdings wurde durch das geändert durch das reden mit anderen Mitspielern da diese einen nahelegen was ich euch nun auch Nahelegen will das ihr das Spiel spielt was euch SPAß macht und nicht darauf zu hören was die anderen Larbern.

Ob ich das Spiel empfehlen kann?

SICHER aber nur für Leute die genug Zeit haben und sich auf ein Spiel einlassen können weil ein MMO sehr viel Content bietet den man auch an sehr vielen Punkten Akzeptieren muss um Spaß zu entwickeln. Bless Online ist ein stinknormales MMORPG mit interessanten PvP Elementen und einem sehr interessanten Taming system was mir persönlich extrem viel Spaß macht.
(Pets,Reittiere für Style farmen)

*Es ist immer wieder witzig auf einer Chimäre zu Reiten und die anderen Gegnerischen Spieler Laufen ein Bogen um ein* :D

Der PvP: Fühlt sich sehr unfertig an macht in einer Gruppe sehr viel spaß und bietet aufjeden fall langzeitmotivation dieser beginnt Offiziel ab LvL 30 in der Openworld statt.
- Ich finde es Super das nun nach und nach der Content angepasst und Hinzugefügt wird. 

(Mich interessiert es nicht ob der Content oder andere Klassen schon in anderen Länder released wurden. Das ist das erste mal das, dass Spiel gepublished wird und ein Buy 2 Play Format angewandt wird).

PVE: Ist der Standard mit den Quest lauf von hier nach da Bla ich würde mir aber noch Wünschen das Auf der Map das Level der Monster und Quests eingezeichnet ist damit man sich Leichter beim grind ab LvL 32 zurrecht findet.

Im Großen und ganzen ist das Spiel noch lange nicht Fertig und ist deshalb auch in der EA was ich sehr genieße weil es mir das Gefühl gibt das die Publisher und Entwickler Aktiv am Projekt arbeiten was man auf Twitter und via Steam wunderbar verfolgen kann.

This semi-linear, tab targeting combat system makes you feel like you have somewhat of a variety but in reality you'll just be spamming the same 2 buttons constantly. When I say spamming, I mean you'll hit R 7 times and then it will FINALLY use your chain skill. There is an undeniable lag from the input to actual action that makes you feel like you're on dial-up. The UI is possibly one of the worst aspects of this entire game. There are literally games from the late 90s with better and more customizable UIs (Asheron's Call, The Realm Online, etc...). Completely ignoring the fact it takes approximately 907 tries to get the game to actually launch, once you're in you're plagued with constant crashes, graphics lag and other terrible graphics issues such as the game freezing for a few seconds just from opening your quests journal, inventory or map. As if it wasn't terrible enough at this point, the game won't even support it's advertised aspect ratios/resolutions.

The pure amount of technical issues with this game, the absolutey poor response and acknowledgement of these issues on NEOWIZ's behalf and the fact that there are apparently no plans to address any of these issues is why I cannot recommend this game and I am requesting a refund.

Photos you see are from terrible CGI in the game - the storyline is epicly terrible and voice by the janitors or something.

Combat is horrendous and to make it even less fluid mouse buttons cannot be hot-keyed.

Nerfed damage to players makes the game next to impossible - apparently they wanted a ""Dark Souls"" meets cant dodge or block AKA you just die.

I WILL explain why this game lost his way and how they change stuff to RIP your money. 
This message will be very long and detailed. You need to know i work in video game industries this last 22 years.
I created economic systems for online game this past 3 years.

I do not know if the moderator of Bless can suppress this message but i have a personal message for you: 
I will copy past this message into ALL the forums, facebook, youtube chanel ... i have used supporting your game.
I will suppress the entire supporting message posted during this last year on any networks. 
I CAN'T be part (by my own stupidity) of something so obviously created to rip money of player base. 
If my company was acting like that, i will resign of my own company. 
What you have done is shameful. Stop taking customers for walking wallets.
What you have before was good, learn how to manage proprely your marketing you will not use so many economic malware to get money on the back of your player base. 

- Taming system: using combo bar
That's ridiculous we lost scrolls so fast that's totally absurd. 
And you need to craft them now. You can't even buy them at any NPC.  

- Combat system is an horrible mess
you can't have any combat strategy, you can only use what the game gives you.
HORRIBLE. You can't choose between standard and combo NO that's just COMBO and if you do not like what the first skill open in the combo box/selection you are simply fuc.ed.  Some will say, play further it will evolve later : I will answer : I don't want to play a way i dislike 10h for perhaps get something i can like or dislike even more.  No thx. 

- Action Mode
that action mode exist in any country the game was released. And they just decide to suppress it. 
Why. I do not know. But it is so bad. Only the berserkers have it now. 

- Gamepad 
with the new combo system you obviously use only 9/12 real actions to execute.
You can't map Xpadder or any other software because they decide to FIX the code a way the game cant' support this kind of software. ABSURD as usual. Look at FF14. Look at vindictus or so many games. Even the worst MMo's let you do it. But not Mess Online.

- Fps 
After failing everywhere Neowitz do not even bother to correct the basics and add more stupid choices. 
This company does not deserve our money at all. The game fails because of this, lag issue and loading problems. 
THEY KNOW THIS! EVERYBODY KNOW THIS in RUSSIA / JAPAN / KOREA / CHINA and what they do to fix this in EU / NA: N.O.T.H.I.N.G!  Almost 2 years and the problem in EU (for my side) is even WORST THAN BEFORE. 
My game using a VPN was more fluid using the RU server. What the hell? 

- LVL CAP
I just learn about that and this is why i ask for a refund. In any country the game was released with everything. 
This game has lvl cap to 61 / 65. Not 45.  Why the limit the LVL cap in 45 in EU / Na then? 
To avoiding reaching the worst bugging part of the game. Because the Dungeons are way more bugged after lvl 45. That's ALL. I KNOW IT BECAUSE I WAS THERE, I TRY, I RESIGN, THE SERVER WAS CLOSED 1 MONTH LATER IN RU.

- NEW STUFF TO COME
what a joke. Some race was never implemented on any countries. 
Stuff lvl 61 was N.E.V.ER. RELEASED. Story / Classes / Armor / Content after 61 > NEVER. EVER.

- OLD STUFF MISSING
Where are the ASSASINS ? 
The first stuff i drop in the game yesterday was AN ASSASIN ARMOR!!!! Seriously?
Someone in the marketing of this company was thinking exactly this: "" hey idea of the century, rid of some classes, lower the level limitation cap, and add them parts by parts, they will give the feeling to the player base we working hard for them on new content"" WHAT A JOKE - this ""New content"" was available at the end of 2015!   
That's amazing how this company take us for *GOATS*

- Stamina for mounts
another stupid thing created to get money. Was never here, absolutely not helping players, and created to change mounts often. Everybody knows a horse is out of stamina in exactly 10 minutes. 

- Movement
you are so slow, that's obvious neowitz add stamina for mounts then why do not rip off money on this subject. Awful. And by the way your mounts are slugs too. They divide the speed of the run walk and the mount by 1.5x at minimum.
I have never had a so bad feeling when i walk or run in any mmo's.
And where is your personal stamina bar? Where are the updates to add more stamina when you run?  Suppressed. 
Buy a mount, use more often your recall stone and pay Lumina for it because you are bored to walk at 0.1 km/s.

- Pets
pets have stamina in other versions, ok, yes let me remember it correctly, ah yes THEY CAN BE OUT AT LEAST 1 HOUR before reach the limit and they regen the stamina bar in 10 minutes!  Now: same as mounts.  Good luck to use any of them in any long duration dungeon, oh wait they are gone, my bad, they are reached at lvl 46!

- Lag and loading problems
Even they add more power server sometimes objects/loot/… can't be taken, sometimes enemies do not appear... 

- Camera and interfaces
Award of the r.tards thinking EVER. When any mmo in the world until 2010 gives you multiple choices, Bless gives you nothing!  Even lvl 9 my camera was stuck in walls many time, enemies pop immediately and i can't react. 
I can't change the point of view, i can't change the position in Y axis ...  i remember this is one of the things who decide player base to simply drop the game in other countries because hud killing you and it is not pleasant at all to play this way. Again neowitz learn nothing. 

- Not a pay to win :Sure    Not a pay to play with pleasure WRONG!   LUMINA FOR EVERYTHING!
Re enter a dungeon LUMINA - USe you recall Stone LUMINA - LUMINA – LUMINAAAAAAA
MULTIPLY TIMING RESTRICTION BY 3 or 4 and ask player for LUMINA, that's something i can't allow. 
That's HORRIBLE one of the worst way to fu.k players NOTHING ELSE because they know you will use this! 
Many games have cooldown and they don't RIP the player base money each time they do any obvious actions.
And they know you are going to do it, because it is a basic act you do many times. 
They put what i call an economic malware here. That's disgusting.

And this is what i know only being LVL9! 
I do not want to see more. I do not want to know more. ENOUGH!
This game is DEAD for me. I hope player base do not fall in this gigantic Mess Online.

The launch was bad as they didn't have enough servers and most all ended up on the one server available which meant queues. Then we discovered that action combat wan't available for all classes and only the Bezerker.
One of my main gripes with the game is that the combos require 1-3 buttons to start the combo's but then another R,T,Y for the 2nd and third in the chain well this means I have 6 keybinds all up and moving on my ranger whilst firing those abilities is clunky.
Then an added problems is that although there are 7 races one of which is on both factions, there is only 2 main stories one for each faction. Also the races have there own story area's but only til lvl 4. So in about 45mins you are stuck doing the same story as your previous race on that faction. This is really stupid as I was hoping and was under the impression that the story would be more involved.
Now that there's no balance at end game it's quite hard to play the game as mage/ranger because I simply don't see myself enjoying endgame. Not to mention that there's only a small amount of content at this stage in the games life.
I just feel that the nerf from a recent patch yesterday was a bit heavy handed because it's meant soloing dungeons is alot slower. The quests are quite lackluster and in all honesty I don't see myself playing it when it's unbalanced.

Worse than normal bad launch. Nerfs that make pve almost impossible without testing changes or asking players. Runs on DX9 and has very bad optimization. Shallow crafting. No trading between players. Mounts run out of stamina very quickly at higher levels so you have to always have many to switch to. Only part of the game was released so they can release more classes/levels at different times.

Dont waste you time with this game if you are thirsty for a new MMO. Queue's to play are almost innevitable especialy if you and a group of friends started characters on the only server that was available to you during the Early Access Founders Pack Release.
 i gave this game more than a fair chance, i bought the deluxe which was stupid of me to do and hope this game would at leased be have legitamently playable, but it hardly is. it might say i have 22 hours of gameplay but i have 1/3 of actual play time, the rest is me sitting in a queue to play only to be disconnected after half an hour of playing to sit in THAT same queue again and again.

this is the first time ive ever felt compelled to get a refund for a game ive purchased and i will admit i persued a refund after my hour played because i have seen people get a refund and have put in more time than i have in the actual game,
but im not expecting it.
the game is no optimized. the main city youll get max 15 FPS no matter what Graphics Card or CPU you have.

the game was completly overloaded during its pre release, which is to be expected normaly but this is the 4th region that this game has been released in so they should have expected this and its ridiculous that they didnt seem to prepare for it in the slightest way possible. when i started there was 1 server for EU but they claimed there was 2. there is now 6 or 7 servers and 3 of them are full.
theses are just a few issues ive experienced personaly and i could go on but i feel like other negative reviews are FAR more in depth and better explained than this.

This was the third official launch of this game after failing in two other market areas. This game was originally launched in 2012. The game is almost an exact copy with some minor changes from the other two failed iterations. Some of the minor differences are in combat, which was supposed to be improved. It still sucks. Other changes are the removal of several playable classes and a lot of content is missing.
I purchased the Founder's Edition for roughly $150 USD thinking I would get some decent skins etc. Well come to find out that I can only redeem the Founder's Edition rewards on one character on one server and the items can never be transferred. Okay cool, but I can at least pick any class and any server, right? Wrong. So many restrictions were placed on the servers because of their inability to judge the initial lauch. 3 day early access, I think I played about 4 hours total during that period. Another 4 hours spent restarting the game / waiting in queue or just sitting in the game waiting for my quest to update 15 minutes after I completed the task.

The questing system is pretty boring. Unless you're playing an AOE class or a Mage you're likely going to have a very slow grind ahead of you. Dungeons are soloable, which is strange, but okay. Some people were saying you should farm the dungeons 15 times before moving on to the next content. Well that's pretty stupid.

I had 3 other friends trying to play the game at the same time. We tried questing together for about 2 hours then realized there really wasn't much of a benefit to it especially considering we were constantly having to wait for each others quests or game crashes or whatever other nonsense was going on to clear.

This game holds your hand through everything.  Like literally everything. Even goes as far as having an auto run to quest objectives. The quest path is exactly the same for every person. Side quests were your typical go kill x amount of stuff of which there were several along the way, but no true way to go off and explore areas or quest to your own liking.

This game felt less like an open theme park and more like a guided tour with set activities along the way.

Lots of content is lacking from end game so that's something to keep in mind if you plan to play this.

From personally experience the game runs well. I am running game on medium graphics(rig cant run high end atm) and gettign 40 frames while fighting and in dungeons while in cities I get around 25-30. I have not done any file edits that people have suggested on reddit. So this is my default. The storyline is well done, however translations are wonky in multiple places. WOuld I recommened this game for people who are interested in a emerging still in progress(beta) type game, yes. If you want a finish and polished game, come back in a few months and see then. The publishers are making mosts and edits to the game each day so they have not abandoned the game at all. Overall here is a breakdown:

Pros:

-Fun combat
-Good Story
-Very nice open world pvp
-Fun dungeons
-Encourages party play (yes its a mmo dont think everything can be soloed)

Con:

-Texture quality is not the best, can really see this during cutscenes.
-Slight delay in dodging aoe and telegraphs on the ground (getting hit by aoe when you were not even in them)
-Some people (not me) have fps and optimization issues with game so even if you have a high-end rig it may not run it right.

This causes your armour to be broken, since you're not going to be level 13 you also can't fix it. Since you can finish the quest you can't play the game. This will lead you to opening a ticket. Opening a ticket is only possible on a web form, this webform does not confirm your submission.

Cause: Bad code.
Resolution: Unknown.

I will update this when (if) I'm able to play the game.

UPDATE: The quest issue fixed itself after 4 days, it's been 2 days without a reply to my support ticket.",True,1527968838,1528042332,False,0,2,0.497962,True

Das Spiel befindet sich aktuell im Early Access. Das scheinen viele ""negativ Bewerter"" zu vergessen.
Auch, dass die meisten, die das Spiel als negativ bewerten, nicht über Level 20 hinaus gekommen sind, sagt eigentlich alles.

Ja das Spiel hatte Probleme mit den Servern, diese sind aber mittlerweile behoben. Als Entschädigung hat der Puplisher sogar jedem Spieler Ingame Währung im Wert von ca. 20€ geschenkt. Einen Puplisher dem die Spieler egal sind, hätte dies nicht getan. 

Bugfixes kommen täglich. Es wird fleißig auf die Spieler gehört und eine gute Kommunikation der Entwickler ist vorhanden. In den nächsen zwei Wochen kommt vieler, neuer Content dazu (Wurde bereits angekündigt). 

Zum Spiel: 

Das Spiel macht super Spaß und ist nach all dem 0815 Einheitsbrei eine tolle abwechslung. Das sammeln von Mounts und Pets macht richtig Laune. Das Leveldesign ist ansprechend aber leider nicht wirklich etwas besonderes. Die Gebiete und Dungeons sind grafisch wunderschön. Selten habe ich so detailreiche Gebiete und MMO´s gesehen. 

Es gibt natürlich noch viel Arbeit am Spiel aber deswegen ist es ja auch im EA. 

Ich für meinen Teil kann jedem empfehlen die Paar Euro in die Hand zu nehmen und dem Spiel eine Chance zu geben. Schnapp Euch ein paar Freunde und kloppt die gegnerische Fraktion :D

only currently played guardian at the moment so cant really say how other classes play but enjoying guardian alot and the animations of the skills and the combos flow really well, had to do a few keybinds to make it more comfortable to play but thats all down to personal prefrence

latest patch has smoothed out performance issuse not 100% but still a big step to where it should be, if its not the best for you have a look at changing some of the ini files i know its not really what you want to do after you have purchased the game but thats early access for you there is also a new fps increase at the moment for nvidia cards also cant really comment on how much that increases fps by as im on a RX480

Ich hab namhafte andere MMORPG´s von Anfang an gespielt, die wesentlich mehr Probleme ZUM RELEASE hatten, wie dieses Spiel das noch in der EARLY Access ist (und das vergessen einige).

My main issues:
 -Game balance between classes, between experience gained from different mobs (same level mob in the same area will net half the exp of the one next to it and be harder to kill etc.). Just seems like they didn't finish the game.
 -Running dungeons in a party is almost pointless if you want any exp you HAVE to solo them. Solo I can get 50-60% of a level at the dungeon right now, in a party I might get 5-10% of one (even with just 1 other person). Stupid for an MMO

The charcter customizer is WONDERFUL and I really enjoy it.

Also the translation could be better but its not like its in chinese, put a little effort in and you'll be able to understand that 3Level means level 3.

The game has a great potential, so am in love with it. I know many reviews are bashing the game around, but the most common reviews are issues that being fixed or will come out later. 

Most common negative reviews i've seen are:

- Splash loading screen error (Fixed)
- Too many maintaince (Fixed plus they were just for the first few days)
- FPS issues, there are a lot of fixes for that (Hopefully the game will be optimized upon official release)
- Wrong Translation (Being fixed as i saw fixes already)
- Not all classes available (We're in Early accesses it's expected)
- Game too easy than other versions (THANK TO THAT WE GOT NERFED THANK YOU HARDCORE PEOPLE) So yes the game is much harder and more rich in dungeons specially.

Otherwise the gameplay is fun it reminds me of the hard days of Vanilla wow and the world PVP is fantastic (For those who love to be ganked and gank). 

I do recommend for game for people who are willing to play with things now and ok with it. However for people who doesn't like a half-released game just wait till the official release and you'll get a wonderful game.

Daí se isso acontecer você vai ter que dar longas caminhadas. Outra coisa ruim que acaba com seu gold no jogo, é que voce tem que comprar itém para coletar materiais do mapa. Nunca tinha visto isso antes em um MMO. Ou seja, o jogo está extremamente limitado. Com isso vai perder muitos players que não são acostumados com isso. O trade no jogo está bloqueado, achei isso ótimo, pois impede muitas malandragens. Mas voce pode colocar para vender mais barato ao seu amigo no Leilão.

Bless is a very good game, it is stable does not fall with ease. I spent more than 8 hours playing several days without falling any time. The gameplay is excellent. With the exception of Berserker, which has a problem with the gameplay, the camera is locked, you can not move the character with the mouse without moving the camera. Another bad thing is game money drop rate is very low. Another very bad problem is that the dragon teleport charges 2 bucks, in my analysis, it should be for free. If the percentage / rate of cash fall is so low, we should not pay for the ride. Yesterday for example I ran out of money to fly from one map to another. If this happens you will have to take long walks. Another bad thing, when your gold ends in the game, is that you have to buy a piece of it, to collect materials from the map. I've never seen this before in an MMO. That is, the game is extremely limited. With this will lose many players who are not accustomed to this. The trade in the game is blocked, I think this is great, because it prevents many things wrong. But you can put to sell to your friend cheaper at the Auction. Remembering this is my opinion! But I recommend the game. They are beautiful graphics. The game is light to spin. Little lag compared to other games when they started.

The game currently has it's issues, but the developers are patching the game quickly to fix majority of the bugs. Currently the translations are bad, but the story is decent for an MMO. The combat feels wonderful, and the rhythm combat is easy to do, but difficult to master. World is large, but some of it is empty at the moment.

I don't have too much time on my hands, and sadly couldn't really get into due launch problems. And let's be fair; there are still problems- and the one I am currently really disliking is the FPS problem. Next to that is the translations. The well known ''You've become 10level.'', and when you first startup the game, the small tutorial has such a bad translation it is almost impossible to know what to do. But it gets better further into the game, but it has to be fixed. 

But- the gameplay, and the game itself are great! The combat feels fine, you just gotta get into it. The questing vibes are alot like other eastern MMO's, such as autowalk to a quest, playing out stories with cutscenes and the constant walking between points, with grinding/'hunting' quests in between. 

I can definetly recommend it already in its early acces state for the given price. It's enjoyable, and a fresh feeling from the other MMO's for now. The classes are fun, and I like the combosystem.

I have stopped trying to play the game, however i have not refunded it. I have came back to the game on the 4th day to find all the above issues resolved. The game still lags in some places, but this is due to the engine that it's running on.

Bless ohromuje rozlehlým světem, kde každý kout je pustinou s životem na pokraji života. V tomto ohledu na mě nostalgicky dýchly časy L2, kdy jsem zažíval takřka stejné pocity.

Hab mir das Spiel gekauft nachdem ich mir einiege Youtube Vids angeschaut habe, nur musste ich feststellen das sie in der Zwischenzeit das Kampfsystem umgestellt haben, vorher konnte man sich ein Skill-Build zusammenstellen was ich sehr gut finde, nun gibt es ein Skill-Chain System was meiner Meinung nach das langweiligste ist was es an Kampfsystemen in mmorpg gibt. 

 Hier hat man versucht das ganze aufzulockern indem man zwischen 2 Haltungen hin und her schalten kann, mit 5 sec. cooldown. Das macht das ganze aber nicht besser. Das Kampfsystem könnte mehr Spaß machen wenn man mehr Auswahl an ""non chain skills"" hätte, aber hier gibt es nur 8 wobei man 4 wählen kann -_-

Tab-Target ist nicht schlimm, ist man seit Jahren gewöhnt, aber Skill Chain.... Ich möchte gerne selber entscheiden wann ich welchen Skill verwende, das macht Spaß erfordert Planung und ermöglicht eine gewisse Individualisierung im Spielverhalten. Skill Chain ist eine Fessel für den Spieler und eher zu gebrauchen für Hirn aus Grinder wie BDO, aber nicht für ein Spiel was auf PvP als Haubtmotivation setzt. 

( Auch möchte ich mit der linken Hand keine Skills zünden, die ist zum laufen da Skills feuert man mit der rechten Hand ;-D. Ja ich weiß alles Sache der Einstellung, nur macht  gerade ein Chain System das ganze recht schwierig, auch mit einer Razor. )

- das Spiel macht Spaß. Ich habe endlich mal wieder dieses besondere MMORPG feeling, welches ich lediglich bei AA, BDO und Aion einst hatte. Das lässt mich auch über etwaige unschöne Dinge hinwegsehen.

Spiel sieht gut aus, Kampfsystem ist herausfordernd und abwechslungsreich (man kann sehr viele Combos, gepaart mit Non-combo skills raushauen), Taming ist gut, Performance ist schlecht.

The voice acting was hit or miss, though they had to work with the terrible, nonsensical dialogue they were given.

It runs pretty poorly even on a computer above speccs. And opening any sort of menu seemed to really cause it to panic.
The game is definitely incomplete. I get classes not being released later. But why is their gear dropping for me in dungeons? And why am I getting daily quests where I need to interact with classes that dont exist yet? (Tho I found that quest goal itself to be cute)

The combat was okay on some classes. It was pretty neat to use the combos (though definitely pick new keybinds, as they defaults are ridiculous) and kind of fun. 
Then they “fixed” it and it went plop. Not necessarily the combat itself or even that killing mobs is tougher, but just that you have to sit around and wait for health to regen slowly after each fight. When you need to kill 10 of everything or are trying to complete kill 40+ Hunt quests, that gets old FAST. 
Also, while the skill menu looks like you have options, there are a ton of skills you’ll never really use or that are virtually identical to other skills you already have. There’s pretty much no meaningful customization of skills or combos. Some of the skills did have neat customizations, but the vast majority dont. 

Visuals...everything about my character was cool. Armor, character creation, skill effects. But step two feet away and it’s stretches of nothing, repetitive mobs, and splotches of grass. I do think visuals were their strong suit, but it wasn’t consistently good or bad. 
The cutscenes were hit or miss, but some were pretty decent and enjoyable.

Crafting was hilarious. Beginning crafting items with ingredients I wont get to for another 10 levels? What?

That much lauded pet system.... basically a waste of time. May be cooler later in the game, though. I just didn’t find many bonuses that were impactful. Even ones that seemed amazing, like huge boosts to armor on my Mage, didn’t seem to reduce damage at all. 
Mounts I found to be a pain. Barely any speed increase and ran out of energy with inconsistency. Sometimes they could run for days, other times my horse tired from one village to the next.

All in all, its not the worst. I did request my refund, but I can understand people staying. I might consider coming back later, but I doubt it. That they thought this was worth asking money for bothers me. Betas, I get, launch day issues, I get, small dev team, I get. But it seems like they have no idea what theyre doing even when the playerbase is telling them directly. From marketing, to localization, to the terrible and short sighted “fixes”. 
Idk if this was just a shameless cashgrab, esp with them offering refunds and only charging 29.99 base price, but I recommend waiting until its actually worth paying 30 for.

Sokan kérdeztétek, hogy mit gondolok a Blessről, mint játékról és a többi. Aminek örülök, hiszen úgy érzem azért mégiscsak érdekel titeket a véleményem róla. ^^
Sok seb van, amitől kissé vérzik a játék! 😞 De úgy érzem engem mégis vonz ide valami, és élvezek vele játszani. Kezdjük a negatívakkal majd utána a pozitívumaival. Sok-sok videót végignéztem youtuberekről, streamerekről, conent creatorokről akik...hát eléggé lehúzó jelleggel nyilatkoztak róla. Van amiben abszolút látok realitást, de van amiben egyáltalán nem. Sokszor úgy érzem a játékosok elvárják, hogy egy játék tökéletes legyen...holott ezeket is emberek készítik...tehát hibák mindig vannak és lesznek is. 🙄🤔

1. ìgy jön képbe az első dolog ami...""2015 óta kint van a játék mi az hogy ilyen állapotban ki merik adni..."" 
Igaz 2015-ben jött ki Koreában, DE amit mi kaptunk EU-ra (és NA) az egy teljesen átdolgozott formája. Mind a grafikai motor, a combat rendszer és a karakterek közötti balance stb. Konkrétan a team, aki ezen dolgozik, majdnem teljesen újraírja az egész játékot csak mert mi már annyira szerettük volna kipróbálni...és valljuk be őszintén egyáltalán örülhetünk, hogy lehetőségünk lehet vele játszani ezekben a régiókban is. Tény hogy a játék eléggé kezdeti szakaszban van...de minden erejükkel azon vannak, hogy próbáljanak ezeken a hibákon dolgozni és MINDEN NAP valami új patch jön ki szinte, ami próbálja orvosolni ezeket a problémákat. Az emissaryk is mondták hogy már gyűjtik össze pontokban a hibákat a deveknek, hogy segítsék a munkájukat.

Az early acess egy olyan formáját kaptuk meg, ami játékosok által még nem letesztelt verzió és nem wipeolt. Tehát igazából ez egy alpha, béta verzió jelenleg. Hogy őszinte legyek én is azt hittem mást fogunk látni, de ez tényleg az amit elmondtak...egy olyan állapotában láthatjuk ami még kezdeti és egy rakat fejlődésen kell keresztülmennie. Persze szomorú, hogy ezeket a dolgokat előttünk még senki nem tesztelte és az emberek ENRAGELVE hisztiztek a minőségen, mert azt hitték már kész játékot kapnak...holott a Neowiz 1 éve vette át kb az Aeria gamestől...szerencsére...ugyanis az Aeria gamesnek nagyon nem örültünk volna, amit képes lett volna a játékkal tenni P2W ügyben.

3. Premium packok árai:
Hát igen...itt buktáztak talán a legnagyobbat az egészben...hiszen egy B2P gameről volt szó ami lényegében nem lenne gond már így 2k18-ban. Viszont valóban a packok árát alapvetően drágállták már a kezdetek óta a játékosok. Ennek ellenére nagyon sokan vettek nagy packot és közepeset is. Az árukat inkább az ö belefektetett energiájukért cserébe kérték számunkra némi juttatással cserébe. Tehát nem volt kötelező. Itt viszont arra nem gondoltak, hogy a játékosoknak lehetnek rossz következeteseik és ha látják milyen állapotban van a game azonnal visszakérik, mert számukra ennyi pénzért ez nem pálya. Ezért a minőségért szerintem sem érnek ennyit a packok...ha tudtam volna, milyen állapotban van a játék valószínű nem fordult volna meg a fejemben a packok megvétele. Hiszen ha belegondolunk milyen játekok vannak kint a piacon 30-40-60 €-ért és amellett is milyen minőséget nyújtanak...valóban nem tehetnek szerintem ilyen állapotú játékot ennyi pénzért a piacra.

4. Balance
Jelenleg a mai patchel bejött egy kb. 80%-os NERF az összes karakterre és emellett megváltoztattak a PVP miatt sok dolgot. Amivel nem is lett volna gond, ha nem túl drasztikusan történt volna meg ez a döntés, mert míg nekem a palám nagy nehezen tolt ki DPS-ben 150-200-1500 critet, jelenleg 50-200-600 critem van, viszont kevesebb sebzést kapok be, healem is többet tölt és még a manám is jobban bírja. Tehát összességében nem okozott nagy érvágást az alap beállításokhoz képest. Sokan emiatt is most nagyon hisztiznek ugyanis a fejlődés sokkal jobban belassult, viszont szükség van így már partyra és klános összefogásra. A jövőben elvileg ezen is változtatni fognak. Különösen a PVP miatt történt meg ez változtatás amiről fogok majd készíteni videót is. Őszintén...nagyon élveztem a BG-t így is pedig nem vagyok egy nagy pvp player. ^^

4. Optimalizálás
Direct X9, ezen fut a játék jelenleg és ez bizony a grafikus motorja így 2k18-ban. Ami aki ismeri ezeket a dolgokat az tudja, hogy 2002-ben létrejött dolog és bizony ez nem mostani. Az újabb játékok már DX 11-et használnak általában ami 2009-2013 között készítették. Valóban nem túl étvágygerjesztő a tudat, hogy egy 2015-s gameben egy 2002-es program található, de biztosan megvan az oka, amihez én persze nem értek nem vagyok informatikus, de ez egy nagy kérdőjel sokak számára. Mivel az én laptopom nem fullos 
(3 éves gamer laptop CPU: Intel® Core™ i7-4710MQ 2.50 GHz Processor
Graphic card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980M
Ram: 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM - PC3-12800 - 1600 MHz) nem egy erömü valljuk be öszintén, de mégis tudtam vele élvezhetően játszani. 
Sajnos mivel fullos gépem nincs így nem tudom megmondani azon hogy futna, de ezzel kapcsolatban vegyesek voltak a vélemények. Valaki feltöltött egy ini átírási lehetőséget, amit én is már alkalmaztam a játék jobb futtatásához, amitől nem lesz különösebben lagg problémám és nálam amúgy 30-90 fps lehetőségig megfordult már minden, a játék sosem volt élvezhetetlen vagy reakciótlan számomra. Ezt majd az elkövetkezendő videóimban is láthatjátok majd. Tehát ez egy relatív dolog minden gépen másképp működik beállításoktól függően meg persze nekem a Shadow levétele sokat segített.

5. Bizalom
A jövőre nézve senki nem tudja, mi lesz. Hiszen nincs bent a játéknak legalább a fele és mivel mindent előről készítenek nem is fog fénysebességgel haladni a content. Nincs bent az assa, mystic és a warlock ami még hát ki tudja mikor fog majd megvalósulni, de természetesen azt mondták őket is szeretnék a választási lehetőségekhez hozzátenni. Számomra egyik sem releváns mert nem érdekel különösebben más class, de igen néha én is mérges voltam a sok szerverleállás és random DC vagy a sok bug miatt. De ezzel különösebben nem csináltak újat...hiszen minden MMORPG életében ez így szokott lenni. A kérdés, hogy mennyire kompetens emberek vannak a monitorok mögött és hogy milyen segítséget kapnak akár a playerektöl vagy az ott dolgozóktól. Mégis úgy érzem a sok hiba ellenére én élvezem a játékot, nem akarom hogy tökéletes legyen hiszen úgysem lesz az, hanem elég ha lepésről lépésre haladnak és próbálnak a hibák javítására koncentrálni. Amúgy úgy tudom mindenki kapott 2500-lumenás kompenzációt, ami 18 € értékben vásárolható meg, szóval nem igazán zsugoriskodtak a játékosokkal. Sokakat már nem is Saltynak mondanám, hanem egyenesen Sósavnak amit a kezük gépelt be a help chatre. Szerencsére már ez is elcsendesült.

6. Konklúzió:
Aki nagyon szeretné kipróbálni. mert viszket a keze egy új MMORPG-re az 30 €-val nem hiszem hogy nagyon mellélőne, de mivel eléggé gyerekcipőben jár a dolog így ne várjon el tökéletességet. Úgy érzem 57 óra információ (lvl 40) tömkeleg után amennyi időt a játékkal töltöttem reális színben tudom feltüntetni ezeket és segíteni azoknak akiket érdekelne a game. Sajnálom hogy streamelni nem tudtam a netem miatt itthon, de videókkal próbálom ezeket korrigálni. ^^",True,1527951281,1527951281,True,0,4,0.545455,True

1. Much of the following is my opinion
2. Bless Online is an early-access title as stated on the store page. 
3. The Yes/No recommendation sticker is not quite clear enough for a game in this state

So, with that said, I am having a blast on Bless.  I went into it expecting precisely what was delivered: laggy gameplay, instability, and lots of whining.  I knew the devs had overhauled several fundamental game systems including combat and the role of the in-game shop, I expected things to be unpolished.  Additionally, having been part of many other MMO launches from each WoW expansion, ESO, Neverwinter and others, I expected there to be glaring problems for at least a few weeks.  That is where things changed in Bless.

Within 24 hours they had address and patched the most wide-spread log-in bug that was preventing many from playing, they immediately opened up new servers to accomodate the influx of players, closed out others to maintain their stability, and just a few days later have begun taking steps (albeit polarizing ones) towards healthier class balance.  The point is, the devs are active and responsive.  As far as I can tell, they are interested in the game doing well and they care about our (constructive) feedback.  

Additionally, as many have found, the community from the other regions' releases of Bless have INI file modifications that have drastically helped the game's performance (at least on my end) to the point where I hardly notice any issues with optimization aside from the perioditic stutter, which, if you've played an early access game before, isn't really a big issue to deal with.  

The point is, the community that enjoys the game is still here and playing, and the devs are active and listening.  

Bless isn't doing anything to crack the MMO genre wide open and revolutionize our expectations.  It's another eastern MMO with a fairly unique combat system and what have been (to me) some fairly engaging and enjoyable in-game systems.

If you have $30 of expendable income and are interested in supporting a game in its ugly stage, give it a shot.  If you don't have that money to spend, don't.  Bide your time on the sidelines and wait to see what happens.

Despite doing that, people take their word as if they are prophets, when all they are doing is proving click bait content.

The game isn't perfect, it has plenty of flaws, but it also has plenty of good things about it, a diamond in the rough.

Combat 9/10
Graphics 8/10
Story 5/10 Extremely cliche with decent voice acting
Optimization 3/10 Still better than Ark
Developer being open to suggestions and doing changes 9/10

Overall One of the best mmo's despite many many flaws.

There are plenty of bugs, optimization is pretty bad unless you edit the INI file, which despite taking no skill and about 30 seconds of your time, still shouldn't be the players job to do. 

The devs are doing a great job so far being vocal and providing fixes even going far as completely cutting stats in half only day 3 into the game. Which despite pissing players off, not being able to 1 shot everything, is good for the game long term.

The combat system has a lot of options, it's basically a 3 path combo system which each opens up into further paths, stances can be swapped, 2 stances can be equiped at a time out of the 5 avaliable right now, more to be added. Stances change your abilities and combo options further, proving you a complex system that has actual choice rather than the typical 1 2 3 4 mmo rotations we are used to. Unlike BDO, you cannot spam the same 3 buttons forever and expect to get far, you need to adapt and slowly as you level extend your combo further, sometimes even switching it up completely.

Servers do not seem to have that day 1 lag anymore, graphics are alright, nothing amazing, but at the same time still beautiful enough to have those moments of awe.

- ERSTELL-TOOL: Eurer Phantasie sind hier kaum Grenzen gesetzt. Man kann nahezu fast alles selbst einstellen, färben und nach Vorlieben anpassen. Dabei entstehen schnell einzigartige Figuren. Mein persönlicher Favorit in Punkto Erstell- Tools in der Online- Rollenspielwelt.
- LIEBEVOLL GESTALTETE UMWELT: Auch wenn ich nicht auf Ultra Grafik spiele, wirkt die Spielwelt durchdacht und charmant. Durch die verschiedene Openworldgestaltung ( z. B. Prärie, Wüste, tiefer Wald) bleibt das Spiel interessant und abwechslungsreich. Einige Tiere kämpfen in der Welt sogar gegeneinander und vermitteln den EIndruck von Realität.
- TUTORIAL: Auch ich war ein kompletter Neueinsteiger. Durch das Turorial, welches einem bis zum Level 25 begleitet, lernt man immer neue Dinge Schritt für Schritt. So zum Beispiel das Handwerk oder Trainieren eures Haustieres. Keine Überflutung an Möglichkeiten in welcher man sich Verlieren könnte!
- UNTERSCHIEDLICHE QUESTTYPEN: Etwas Abwechslung gefällig? Hier ist für jeden Spieltyp etwas dabei. Wer gerne grindet kann Hunterquests machen, bei welchen es darum geht eine gewisse ANzahl von Gegner zu töten. Zudem Gibt es eine Hauptquest mit Storyline und viele Nebenquests. Selbst für das Handwerk werden Quests angeboten um beispielsweise seltene Set- STile zum selbstcraften zu finden.
- ZUVERLÄSSIGES PRODUZERTEAM: Ja, man mag es nach den Problemen zu Beginn kaum glauben, aber das Team arbeitet schnell und nah an der Community. Was gewünscht wird, versucht man so schnell wie irgends möglich umzusetzen. Erste neue Inhalte sind unterwegs, Bugs werden entfernt und an der Serverstabilität wird hart gearbeitet. Erfolge sind erkennbar!

zu erst einmal das Game hat so den ein oder anderen Fehler wie:

- Autonavi läuft manchmal gegen Wände oder will durch Wände laufen (denke das wird mit der Zeit ausgemerzt)
- Questtracker funktioniert im späteren verlauf nur bedingt (sind sie aber am fixen)
- Schaden / Heilung / Schadenmitigation balancing ist noch etwas unrund nach dem ersten Nerfhammer was aber nicht schlimm is da es vorher 1 Shot-Combo-Spammen war was definitiv langweilig war. 
- Leichte perfomance Probleme trotz des Potenten Pc's (1070 GTX + I7 7700k + 16 GB RAM + SSD) welche sich durchs editieren des div. Config Dateien eingrenzen lassen auf eine Relativ stabile Fps zahl (keine 60 in Städten oder vollen Questgebieten). Dazu gibt es entweder hier auf der Steamplattform oder anderen einschlägigen Infomations Portalen Anleitungen und erklärungen wie man den mittelweg findet zum spielbaren optimum
- Fühlt sich deswegen auch hier und da etwas Choppy an zu spielen 

  Zu den positiven Seiten dieses Spieles:
- Die Landschaft ist schick gestalltet
- Gruppen bringen einem auch etwas !!! man kann je nach Zusammenstellung Buffs auswählen, je nach Gruppenaktivität
zum Craften mehr exp oder schneller Craften, mehr Erfahrungspunkte etc. also für jeden etwas dabei
- PvP in der Openworld mach richtig Spaß und es kann sich jederzeit verändern in den umkämpften Gebieten, das mal die eine oder andere Fraktion in der Überzahl ist. 
- Das jede Klasse grundlegend anders ist ! (JA der Tank soll tanken und kaum schaden machen, der Heiler heilen und DD machen den Schaden in einer Gruppe!)
- Hatte ich schon erwähnt das man in einer Gruppe spielen sollte im späteren verlauft ? Nein dann habe ich das jetzt getan :D, das spiel annimiert einen dazu ! Das mach auch spaß :> 
- Das unermüdliche Arbeiten des Teams hinter dem Spiel, es werden regelmäßig momentan gefühlt im 12 h tackt Bugs behoben und am Game geschraubt wo es geht 
- Die Übersetzung ist zum schießen an einigen stellen :D 

Bitte gebt dem Game eine Chance ! Es hat definitiv potenzial ein grundsolides Game zu werden. Lasst euch nicht zu sehr von den s.g. Influencern leiten und macht euch selber ein Bild vielleicht nicht jetzt aber in Zukunft wenn sich die Grundprobleme gelegt haben.

Devs naslouchají komunitě a opravují hru na základě feedbacku, což z vlastních zkušeností nikde jinde není - alespoň jsem to nezažil např v Aionu po 5 letech hraní, gameforge doslova kálelo na to, co komunita chce.

+ Opravdu spousta lidí online a to i po masivní vlně refundů , jednoznačně více lidí než devs předpokládali (jelikož pošítali s jedním serverem a již jich je myslím 8 plných)

+ Obtížnost hry se konečně drasticky změnila a je to dobře - kdo nadává tak jen proto, že žárlí na rychlejší hráče co využili toho easy začátku. Na dungeony je potřeba slušná parta.

+ PvP a 15vs15 aréna (jediná dostupná zatím) je dobrý a balancovaný - porovnávám např s Aionem, kde teda balance nebyl žádnej oproti tomuhle.



- Obrovský množství updatů a to hlavně ve dne i o víkendech, takže spousta volnýho času nevyužita.

- Kdo hrál první dny, měl neskutečnou výhodu oproti nováčkům - dungy šlo doslova solovat jednou ranou,

- Pořád hodne uplakánků, kteří kazí dojem ze hry v chatu i na forech, ještě bude trvat než zmizej.

- Hra je spíše taková beta verze a s tím se musí při koupi počítat - bugy.

Positivos:
- A empresa está ativa e ouve o seu público. 
- Jogo por 67,99, que não é P2W, está de boa(até agora 02/06/2018).
- Jogo dinâmico com seus ambientes de PVP e modos de quest's(história, secudárias, dungeons, etc)
- ping está show de bola aqui. ~140ms(RJ - LiveTim)
- Open world, até agora, está verdadeiro. Nada de Plano de fundo como cenário. As montanhas realmente existem, mundo totalmente imersivo, diferente do que vemos no Tera e outros, onde vc anda 200m e vc é parado numa parede invisível, parecendo que está numa redoma.
- possibilidade de domar tudo que é animal e monstro no jogo para ser sua montaria ou pet.
- Remoção do trade entre players, permitindo somente venda no mercado(leilao). Isso faz o leilão ficar totalmente ativo, melhorando a economia do jogo, e claro, a presença dos gold sellers(alguns não vão gostar rs)

Gameplay:  mix emotions here.  Some of the skills are confusing. Combat is faster than other MMO.  6 out of 10 
Translation:  Needs some serious work here.  3 out of 10
Overall: has it postives and negatives.  6 out of 10

Not as bad as some make it out but certianly did not hit the mark.  Besides trasnlations and stuff.  Animations, customization,  bugs , make some people give it really awful reviews.  It is early release so hopefully they can fix and get ther act together.

Teď si to trošku rozebereme: 

Samozřejmě negativní recenze. Pročpak asi.
Že by to byl early access?! Co jste očekávali? Samozřejmě hra má spoustu technických problémů, 
z kterých bych zmínil hlavně optimalizaci. (Ano fps drops everywhere). K tomu přidejme nějaké 
ty bugy a nedodělané záležitosti a spousta ""hejtu"" je na světě.

To nicméně nemění fakt toho, že hra, jako taková má obrovský potencionál!
Vypadá krásně, hraje se ještě lépe. Nepostrádá ten správný nádech fantasy,
který nesmí chybět ve správném mmorpg. Ale zároveň není přeplněna zbytečnýmy
blbostmi, jako jsou mecha atp. Tudíž si hra udržuje ten správný balanc.

Hra rozhodně potřebuje spoustu péče a oprav, ale zároveň v člověku zanechává

-Fun Combat

-Fun taming system


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The bad:

-Mount system

-Teleporting to dungeon costs money (Either remove it or dont make it cost real money)

-Reviving at spot costs real money (Again either remove it or make debuff and for free)

-They act as if the game is a free to play game while it's a buy to play model.

-Monsters attack zones are disturbingly fast and almost unable to dodge them.

-Dungeon bosses have instant cc, it should be skill based not just random stun locks.

-Grind.. They mentioned there wouldn't be grinding.. holy only thing i've done till now is grind or else you can't progress main quest.

-Lag.. Disconnections and anything to do with connection. 

-Fps drops I have a 1070 gtx 8 gb and even i have fps drops at times.

-Dungeon bosses drop ""assassin gear"" assassin isn't even released what the hell.

-Gathering for crafting.. Stones are way into the north for union. Here i'm talking about level 1 crafting recipes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My opinion:

-The game has been a small rollercoaster ride, you go up and are like.. wow this is pretty fun. Then when you hit level 13-14 you notice it's becoming a grind fest. I feel like the game wants to enforce people to buy their lumena in various ways. Two of them being revival and teleporting to dungeon. 

-The game has some interesting ideas with chaining combos etc, but the execution is kind of poorly done. You can only chain combos 3 times and then continue to 2nd and 3rd skill if you wish to. Now out of most tactics you'll probably only use a few chaining combos cause most of them will be crap.

-This game might become good in few months.. maybe few years. But trust me.. If the game continues to enforce players to buy lumena and act as if it's a free to play model. This game will die soon. 

I know people will try to prove otherwise, but we have seen many mmorpgs die because of this. The game has big flaws, they are soo big people can't ignore them.

Advertised totally different than what it is supposed to be. Apparently they fked up the dmg in launch,they nerfed it making the game PVE content totally unplayable(cant even bother doing main quests since they are not worth the trouble/cant be even completed). So 90% of ppl purchased the game based on the videos and reviews they seen clearly showing that the PVE side was easier than its now...just to fiind out 3 days later that they reduced @80% of that damage changing the whole PVE and PVP side. Unless they do a fix patch its not worth it and pretty much was false advertising from the beggining.

I can however speak regarding the the more constant complaints.   Take them with a grain of salt.  The people complaining seem mostly hung up on things that I do not see.  Crying that the game is too hard now because they nerfed damage output is chief among them currently.  Having played the game before and after this change, I can say that the game was far too easy before the change, and if I am honest I still find it quite easy afterwards, but at least players need to pay attention now, previously short of playing blindfolded it was not challenging at all.   Another common complaint is optimisiation.  Again I do not see it.  I am able to play the game cleanly on medium (3) everything with 50-60 fps @4k.  This is better then I expected given that my video card is a r9 390x, and typically takes a dump playing with 4k resolution.  If there is a point to this babbling it is this.  Unhappy people cry and complain, satisfied people don't.  Keep that in mind when reading the complaints.  Hopefully the devs do not cave too much to the criers and ruin the game trying to appease them.  Not everyone wants everything handed to them, not everyone wants to go from lvl 1 to level cap in a day, but the people who do are happy to vocalize how much it sucks when they can't.

BLESS has fun character customization which is very extensive, once you figure out how to access all the areas you want to change.

Just remember to save your character features so you can access them later without having to purchase any cashshop customization vouchers. 
The game world is beautiful and for those who love taking screen shots of the game artistry it is fantastic.
It is clear they incorporated very talented artists to develop the world environment.
The text translation is still a work in progress. It is actually kind of cute seeing translation and grammatical errors, because the game is so new and still getting those kinks out.
They do need to work on the features of game play. It seems they are changing their model and nauturalizing to the North American market. With that comes distinct changes in class structure of damage attack and defense that are very startling. I noticed with that there are no apparent changes to the number of mobs, Since they have solo instances (yes you end up being thrown into an instance where no one can help you) to complete the majority of their questlines, this can create an inability to complete the end task.
So it is fair to say they need to work out the kinks of party gameplay to allow people to have a comfortable group play environment. 
For those who enjoy solo play in an MMO (no idea why you get a MMO just get a stand alone lol) it is fantastic.

The number one problem is the optimisation. I can live with a game that looks like it would be unexceptional six years ago. I can put up with a good looking game that runs poorly. But I can't really forgive a game that does both. The game has been running the same graphics for years in its other releases. If they haven't fixed it by now, I see no reason to expect improvement.

Translation is also a problem, but that is the sort of thing that can be expected to be fixed, so they get a pass from me on that. Just don't expect the tool tips to be helpful, and expect to be stuck in the tutorial in the mean time.

The combat is so-so. There are apparently going to be improvements in most classes, and the skill trees imply some interesting possibilities for buildcraft down the line. It's just that what I've experienced so far is not too interesting.

I haven't got far in the story yet, and most games with good story are a slow-burn, so I'll reserve judgement, except to say it feels pretty linear.

You get your first mount pretty early, so that's nice, I suppose.

I am not saying that this will never be a good game, it's just that at the moment the good bits are nothing special, and the bad bits are terrible.

Na dany moment jest identyczna jak na wersjach zagranicznych kilka lat temu.

Content: 
Na dany moment ubogi. Farma 2 instancji między 12 a 30+ lvl. Później trochę grupowej zabawy i treść się kończy. Całą resztę odcięto przy premierze. 

Early Access wobec tego produktu to idiotyczny zabieg twórcy, żeby bronić się przed opinią publiczna. Gra kilka lat funkcjonuje na innych rynkach. W niektórych miejscach była już zamykana.

Lets start yes the game uses UE3 but when you follow the guides on the internet to change your .ini files you can get the game to run smoothly at all times. Since the game has launched i have seen nothing but the servers being worked on constantly which from a gamers point of view is amazing keep it up guys. 

The game itself if full of colour graphics are awsome picturesque scenery and many times iv stood around on top off mountains looking at the view with 60fps. (Yes like archeage you can go anywhere you want).

Dont get me wrong the the tutorial is a little confusing but when you get into the game and understand how your combat combos work and how your stances work the games combat system is super rewarding.

I love that nearly every creature in game is tameable for mount or pet.

The main quest line is good and the cut scenes are great.

Open world pvp is awsome love it and cant wait to crush more skulls its hella fun knowing you could be hit by players at any time and the pvp is rewarding.

The combat system when you get a full combat down and you watch the damage go up in your chain and the enemy dies you feel satisfied and want more.

Honestly guys you can listen to all tge whining but the game has been out a few days and most people havent even gave it a week. You are gonna have issues the game is being downloaded by the 1000s every day and people logging in and out every second until the servers stabilize. Yes lag drops happen but mmo doesnt?

This game is truly a great game and the more i play it the more wowed i am by what you can do. Everyday i log out i just want to log back in and play.

I hope this helps all

Mir persönlich gefällt das Kampfsystem mit den unterschiedlich wählbaren Ketten sehr gut und macht auch mega Spaß! Ich bin ein großer Fan von dem Prinzip ""Tank, Heal und DD"" und geniese das Zusammenspiel sehr.
Die Charaktererstellung bietet eine sehr große Auswahl an individuellen Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten. Die große Auswahl an Monstern die man zähmen kann finde ich auch gelungen - von Pferden, Wölfen, Löwen bis hin zu Elefanten oder Skorpionen.
Die Spielatmosphäre und die Spielmusik tragen dazu bei, dass man sich in Bless gut mit der Geschichte und Kulturen identifizieren kann.

Bless Online è un MMORPG dalle enormi potenzialità: personalmente ritengo che gli sviluppatori abbiano cercato di prendere il meglio da tanti videogiochi dello stesso genere per cercare di unificare il tutto in un singolo prodotto. Al suo interno possiamo trovare meccaniche riprese direttamente da WoW, GW2 e molti altri MMO famosi. Fortunatamente, non è un tipo di gioco che propende allo sfruttamento del classico ""farming"" per salire di livello ma, bensì, sfrutta la quest principale per permettere al giocatore di poter ottenere un'ingente quantità di esperienza per favorire i Level-Up. Per diversi anni ho cercato un MMO che riuscisse a prendermi sul serio, senza mai però trovarne uno: i vari giochi del genere diventati famosi nel tempo come WoW, GW2, FFXIV, ESO, BDO per un motivo o per un altro avevano dei problemi sui quali non riuscivo ad andare oltre. Questo Bless Online, invece, lo trovo perfetto in ogni sua forma, sebbene ci sia ancora da lavorare sul bilanciamento delle classi, sull'ottimizzazione e sul contenuto end-game. Personalmente adoro la vicinanza che vi è fra community e sviluppatori, i quali costantemente, ascoltando i proprio giocatori, provvedono a patchare il gioco in maniera da rendere felici i vari acquirenti. Sebbene il lancio del gioco sia stato abbastanza problematico, ora (anche grazie a vari fix che è possibile attuare mediante i file .ini del gioco visitando la community del titolo) è veramente straordinario e penso che continuerò a giocarci per ancora diverso tempo. Per questo motivo mi sento di ringraziare il Bless Team per aver prodotto un titolo di questo calibro e di chiedere loro di non cambiare mai: continuate ad ascoltare la community e sicuramente arriveranno risultati sempre più grandi!

Но, тут не в самой игре заключается проблема, а в доступности. Многи наверное сталкивались с такой проблемой - ""Failed to connect to server. The client will shut down (0)"". Это значит, что игрок из РФ не сможет зайти в игру, так как он из RU региона. И для того, чтобы играть, худо-бедно, нужно отдельно устонавливать специальные проги для обхода VPN. Судя по всему, это не из бесплатных удовольствий: вы не только потритите свои деньги на саму игру, но еще, можно сказать, ежемесечно или меньше будите сливать свои деньги на обслугу проги для обхода VPN.

В игре две на данном этапе проблемы - это ограниченный доступ для RU-аудитории, только через VPN можно ""наслаждаться игрой"" и отсутствие русского языка, что делает игру крайне не комфортабельной для игры. Я пытался колдовать с файлами, чтбы хоть как нибудь сделать часть текстов русскими. Но, все это бесполезно, часть перевода будет на столько корявым, что вы с трудом будите понимать что да как. И не важно какой русификатор вы установили, от делитаната или профессионального программиста.

При таком раскладе разработчики игры совершили тотальную ошибку, ограничив игруков с RU-региона в доступности игры и языка - как по мне это дискриминация русской аудитории.

Короче говоря, я бы не рекомендовал бы сейчас преобритать игру, лучше подождите, когда в игре появится хотябы русский перевод. А в идеале, русский перевод и снятия ограничения с RU-региона в доступности игры.

Não tive problema alguúm com o game, está muito melhor do que eu esperava na verdade.

Agora, muito importante. Não escute os haters, não importa se fizerem o melhor mmo/jogo do mundo, eles sempre estarão lá querendo colocar o game pra baixo, se eles não gostaram, ninguém pode gostar.

ich möchte hier jetzt gerne mal mein Kommentar zu Bless Online abgeben. Ich habe mir das Spiel zum normalen Releastag am 30.05.2018 in der Standartversion gekauft (also ohne Premium und ""Vorteile""). Ich habe des ganzen Hate und Shitstorm zu diesem Spiel gelesen und kann sagen, dass fast alle aussage zu totaler Bullshit sind. Bei mir läuft das Spiel relativ flüssig durch mit minimalen rucklern an einigen stellen, die aber nicht weiter ins gewicht fallen. Außerdem lassen sich manchen Menschen und auch Youtuber (die es eigentlich besser wissen sollten) über die UI und das Kampfsystem aus.... Leute das sich Dinge die man persönlich so einstellen kann das es für jeden passt. 

Zugegeben, dass normals System im Kampf bei dem Kombos mit R, T und Y ausgeführt werden ist etwas sehr umständlich und unglücklich gewählt. Ich habe mir diese Tasten jetzt alle komplett auf die Maus gelegt und es funktioniert super. An der UI habe ich nichts ändern müssen weil es sehr minimalistisch ist und keine störenden dinge auf den Bildschirm wirft. 

Um nochmals zu den kleinen Rucklern zu kommen. JA es ruckelt an der ein oder anderen Stelle aber das ist auch eine Beta von einem enorm großen Onlinespiel das quasi nur eine Ladezeit hat und dannach eine riesige Map bietet die frei erkundbar ist... also kommt mal runter.

Außerdem wurde sich darum ausgelassen, dass es für den Dungeonfinder die Teleportfunktion nur das gibt wenn man dafür Gems benutzt die mit Echtgeld gekaufte werden müssen. Leute... man muss sich ja iwie noch finanzieren um das Spiel weiter vorran zu bringen. Außerdem, wie wars denn damals im WoW zu beginn? Da gabs keine automatische Gruppensuche und dass man gleich zur Inis geportet wird. Es sind mittlerweile alle so faul und verwöhnt von solchen Funktionen. 

Um zum Abschluss zu kommen. Ich persölich finde das Spiel gut auch wenn es das MMO keinesfalls neu erfindet. Das lvlen und looten macht Spass und lauft verdammt nochmal selber zu den Dungeon und sucht dort ne Gruppe.",True,1527923127,1527923127,True,1,1,0.485009,True
0,53,3,5857,5857,76561198045810195,0,english,False,42440695,"Bless Online is probably the most misunderstood MMO in history. A one purchase, PvPvE game that isn't pay2win, sounds familiar doesn't it? That's right! Bless directly competes with GuildWars 2, a game that has recently developed a cult following after failing to impress for many years. GuildWars 2 fans (LazyPeon included,) felt threatened by this title and that mostly explains the extremely overblown hate train we're witnessing now. 

While it may be trendy to despise Bless like the worst thing ever, is that reaction really justified? 

Simply... No.

Bless is not a 10/10 and is rough around the edges. There are performance issues for many people that require some minor tweaking to get around, but once those steps have been followed the game runs just fine. There are some debatable changes, like having turned off player trading so that all trade is done through the AH. You might have heard people complaining about a lack of endgame content, but don't worry about that. I've played 50 hours and I'm still only level 27, because I took my time to enjoy what the game has to offer. There is plenty of fun, engaging content that will keep all but the speed runners occupied until more content drops. (15v15 just launched btw, updates are coming at an incredible pace.)

The combat is satisfying and the open world PvP is quite fun. The crafting systems are deep, open ended but easy to get the hang of. The game strikes a nice balance between sandbox and theme park. The graphics while not revolutionary are still very pretty. The character creator is extremely robust and the character models are beautiful. Bless has an old school MMO feel without breaking immersion.

After all the toxic ragers left, the core community revealed itself to be surprisingly kind, amusing and friendly. I've spent hours laughing in help chat, which has become the official joke channel while also supplying advice. Party buffs were added as a way to continue encouraging group play despite the lack of personal trading, and there are buffs for every type of group. Be it crafters, hunters; dungeoneers and so on. It is always practical and fun to play with your friends or make new ones. I've found multiple in game friends so far! 

I'm going to give bless a solid 7/10 in its current state. Once people don't have to go on reddit to fix the performance and the other classes are finished I'll happily upgrade that rating to 8/10, and if player trading is turned back on I'll give it a 9/10. ;)

I have dealt with ArcheAge launch (total disaster IMO), Dragon's Prophet, and Black Desert Online launches. I understand that this game has been out for other countries for a while so I'll be unbiased.

Pros: Devs are working tirelessly to bring updates and fixes to the game that past developers have let sit in their own game. They also compensate for issues that should have been fixed. Despite the game not really bringing anything new to the genre, it is really fun. Taming mounts and pets, combo system, crafting are a few that I enjoy. Flashy animations make you feel like you're really putting out the punishment.

Cons: There are still optimization issues, especially in towns or crowded areas. You have to manually edit the .ini files to get stable FPS. Combat is fun, but still clunky and most of the skills aren't translated well (they gave compensation as skill resets). I play Beserker and some of the CC in their skills don't work. Despite all this the community is the biggest let down. There is a lot of hate here in and out of the game. 

If you can look past the toxicity and bugs this game is growing nicely. Like I said, Devs are working around the clock to fix bugs and translation issue so these won't be here long.

Performance and general:

-Constant fps drops, poor graphic performance, 30 fps even with high end GPU/CPU.
-End game content is missing, they cut off content to release it in the future.
-Lots of features are broken or not working properly, the others give you a feeling of being unpolished.
-Google translate on everything
-Unnecessary big and empty map.
-Repetitive grinding for no reason.
-Zero option/UI customization.
-Bugs, bugs, exploits, item dupe, bugs.....
-Unexperienced Devs, they don't test things, they blindly apply patches and break the game even more with every new one.

-Combat: 

-Combo system is overcomplicated, even though it looks hard, skillcap is extremly low. 
-The skills are extremly simple, ''Deal single target damage'' ''Deals AOE damage'' ''Deals damage and stuns'', that's all you find arround 40 different skills.
-Half of the skills are useless, no reason to use them because of stronger ones in the same chain.
-Every class has an exploitable mechanic, nearly impossible to balance because of how it works.
-Worst tab target ever made, randomly takes targets across the screen 100m away from you instead of closest ones.
-Skills with wrong description, bugged skills, unintelligible google translated skills. 
-Unfair stunlock mechanics with no counterplay.
-Devs never tested Heal/damage values or % scales, and it looks like they dont know how it works.

Why? Despite the rough launch - which was promptly dealt with (As they should have expect more players than they did)
This very small team as efficiently dealt with feedback, within days of them being reported. Live monitoring of situations, direct cnnection to the community - this game will get polished, I have no doubts with this

However...
The game runs well for some, poorly for others however - do check the recommended system requirements first to get an idea! 
What you should expect is some lag, fps drops in major cities, servers being crowded/full/crashing during parts of the day and (currently at this time of writing the review) Major class imbalance with stats and skills - this is being adjusted though. 
Endgame is lacking content, but will be updated 1-2weeks (they just released a small RvR) 
UI is not customizable and currently no action combat (later implemented).

But...
Mostly a PvP game but also has PvE content! Like pokemon? Are You a hoarder of creatures? You can tame everything in Bless Online while you travel this purely open-world map!

Personally, some other good aspects in my opinion, are how the skills are and the style of combat is. No button mashing, you have to actually learn your skills now. 
Skill effects are customizable as well (on a side note, the character customization is also good) and there are not slutty outfits right now.

I want to start saying that I bvelieve this game has potential to be good. it may not be the best MMO out there, but it could hold a decent playerbase. With that said, all I see from NeoWiz is complete incompetence in how they have managed this game since the 28th that founders had access to the game. From launching the game with a small amount of servers which caused people to wait in queue of 2k+ people, the terrible optimization of the game, but worst than all, the lies. The deception is what really bothered me, we were promised an improved combat system. Shortly before the game launched they announced that only 1 class will have the action camera. The other 4 classes will get it at a later date. The community had to bring a tweak from the Russian version to fix most of the optimization issues. NeoWiz should be ashamed that they couldn't figure this out in 3 other regions before bringing us this garbage. Today, 6/1/2018 they applied a damage nerf to force people to party together for regular world content and use more skills. Their patch notes are extremely vague. It shows a lack of communication skills that have been a constant issue since day 1. There's 0 information about what the changes were and how much they changed it. ""Decreased damage for most skills"" In what professional enviroment is this acceptable? I want to see by how much did you decrease my damage, what skills do what damage now. My class is completely useless and I can't honestly tell anyone of my friends to buy the game in it's current state so that we can complete the main quest content together.",True,1527907581,1527907581,False,0,0,0.000000,True
0,164,2,1280,1280,76561197970058182,0,english,False,42437359,"Quick and dirty review, this MMO is not absolute trash, but I have no confidence in the ability of the team to actually right this ship and make this game anything better than a mediocre MMO.

First off the game launched with only one server, ONE.  I understand that they couldnt let people pre order because it was in early access (more on that later) so they were not sure how many servers they needed, but really, one server......Thats either a complete lack of conficene in your product, or inexperence with MMO's in general.  You dont have to have worked on an MMO in the past to know how MMO lauches go, and they are never smooth, so why hamstring yourself with ONE server when there are so many examples in the past that you can look at that tell you this is a horrible idea. 

Second the translations are bad enough that people were having trouble going through the tutorial because it was telling them to ""mount"" (the term this game uses when it means equip) abilities that were not in the game.  Its engrish so its not so bad you cant figure it out, but its very lazy, and just another log on this trashfire. 

Third is the end game content, It was cut out.  Honestly, that by itself is not horrible, there have been other MMO's that have had limited end game content and this really only affects players who poop-sock the game and reach end game in 40 hours or so.  However, this is worth mentioning here because this game has already been launched in Korea, Japan, and Russia.  We have three other regions where this game is not early access, its a completed game, being used right now, and has been since 2015.  There are changes to this release, but those changes were to the combat system, the developers have not said that the base content of the game was changing, only the combat, the background numbers of this game. Re-balancing aside, why would content need to be cut?  Speaking of cut content, they also removed the action combat mode that they proudly showed as a selling point for this version from all but the Berserker class.  Nobody really knew they were doing this, or why.  On launch day there were scores of people asking in global chat how they could turn it on.  Apparently their reasoning is that it needed tweaking and would be added at a later date, no ETA has been given other than ""later date.""

Lastly, optimization is very bad.  The game does not utilize the GPU much and because it uses DX9 it also doesn't utilize multiple core CPU's.  So there are bottle necks abound and your beast of a machine is going to have issues pumping out more than 30 FPS, and just get out of the main cities as fast as you can.  There are .INI fixes that you can use if your comfortable manually editing those files, but these are mods that YOU will have to do.

All in all, nothing here is a deal breaker, but all together it just sucks the fun out of the game.  That and the droning fanbois defending all the mistakes saying its early access.  You know what, it should not have been early access.  What they said they were going to change is not enough to justify saying that this complete game from another region that needs translation and a combat overhaul is going to need to be re-tooled soo much that it needs to be sold as early access, I think they did this just to give rabid white knights a talking point to try and quell anger to keep sales up just that little bit longer.

I foolishly stuck it out when soo many other were refunding this game because I wanted to see what this team could do, but after this most recent patch, a 60-70 percent nerf to damage across all classes, I cant help but feel like this team just doesn't know what they are doing and don't know what to do now.  It seems to me like the NA team don't really have the experience they need for this project and instead are just sacrificial lambs to the slaughter while Neowiz try to siphon just a little more cash out of a IP that failed 3 times already.  Maybe keep an eye on this game and check it out in 6 months, but right now spend you time and money elsewhere.",True,1527907511,1527907511,False,0,1,0.504132,True

A cash shop fornece itens como expansão de inventário, skins de aparência para montarias e item para resetar skills.

In active patch it takes like 25~30sec to kill a mob solo.Also low damage consumes so many health potion(not a problem for me as a Berserker) with endless cooldown time. Completing quests with a party is also pain cuz we lose so many XP points as it divides 5 times to party.I get 100xp for solo kill and 19xp with party lol.

The developer just now nerfed skill damage accross the board.  This was done to ""balance PVP"" yet oddly enough the net effect is to almost double the grind time necessary to level.  So getting to level cap where the end game is PVP is going to take you twice as long.  I was having fun and found the play enjoyable.  Doubling my time to kill in PvE is not fun.

Boo on you Neowiz.  I won't get a refund but I won't reward you with more money until you get a clue.

My response to their response about the power nerfs.
""Neowiz you got my $40 and the clock is ticking on my premium time. I will not play this game with the doubled leveling nerf you instituted and called a balance pass. You won't get any more of my money until I believe that it won't be wasted on a developer with no common sense. You are wasting my bought and paid for premium time with your stupid and untested game changes. I was enjoying the game and the changes you made impacted that fun. You get no Early Access excuses. You took my money for a subscription. Tell me why I should trust you with more money?""

Overall: 4.3/5

Combat: 3.5/5
Bless Online utilizes unique style of combat revolving around minimal keybindings that expands into various combo trees.
For example, a classic skill combo goes as follows
    - [u]1[/u] -
   [u]a[/u]-  -b
 c-[u]d[/u]  e-f
In the early levels before your class unlocks more parts of their combos, combat can feel a bit repetitive and boring. Later on, you do have more variety and more ""flashy"" attacks however.

Visuals 3.5/5
Bless Online sports visuals that are a bit generic, and will tend to remind you of many other eastern mmorpgs and similar genres. What separates Bless in my opinion from the aforementioned would be the realistic detail that goes into most armors.

Races&Classes 5/5
In Bless, there are two primary factions, the Union and the Hieron. These factions start in different zones and differ in main story quest, however the general game experience isn't too different between the two. There are 4 races, with each faction having ""subraces"" that are generally very similar.

Habichts/Amistad: Your bread and butter human race. Able to access all classes in the game.

Sylvan/Aqua Elves: The elves in Bless are generally slim, narrow faced with the classic pointy long ears. Generally, NPCs in this race are equal to the height or slightly taller than humans. Female elves are more humanlike in their appearance, with their male counterparts being a bit more lean and narrow faced. Elves are unable to play as Berserkers.

Lupus/Pantera: The beast races. Pantera hold a more lion-like appearance whilst the Lupus are more wolf-like. Generally they are the stronger, larger race. The large beast races are unable to play as Mages and Paladins.

Mascu: Mascu are viewed as a neutral party that is available on both factions. This race is full of small, beast like creatures covered in fur. They are able to play every class currently released.

Current Classes:

Guardian: Sword & Shield Tank, utilizes medium and heavy armor. The Guardian focuses on damage mitigation and aggro control with a variety of skills and interruptions.

Paladin: Sword & Blunt Weapon Healer, utilizes heavy armor. The Paladin may not be able to deal as much damage as the other classes. but it is the only one capable of healing it's allies. In a pinch, the Paladin can function as a secondary tank.

Ranger: Bow using Physical Ranged DPS, utilizes medium armor. The Ranger focuses on single target damage and kiting it's opponent with various movement debuffs.

Mage: Staff using Magic DPS, utilizes robes. The Mage focuses on heavy damage both AoE and single target. As much of a powerhouse as the mage is, they must properly monitor their resources or risk being easily destroyed due to their weak defenses.

Berserker: Two Handed Physical DPS, utilizes medium and heavy armor. The Berserker is a wrecking ball when it comes to close range combat, and has a plentiful amount of AoE attacks.",True,1527899571,1527899571,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Ja es ist der 3 Launch von diesem Spiel. leider waren vorher 1 Dubioser Chinesicher Publisher und beim 2 mal Gameforge am werk. Also kein Wunder das es in die Hose gegenagen ist. 

Jetzt ist der Entwickler selber am Werk und ich bin begeistert von der Arbeit die geleistet wird.
es wird alles versucht der Community gerecht zu werden und das mit Herzblut. Allein dafür lohnt es sich das Spiel zu holen. 

Das game ist noch in der Beta, so wie es derzeit besteht. Es wurde viel geändert zur Vorgängerversion und daher nicht mehr zu vergleichen. Das kampfsystem macht riesen Spaß und gibt einem extreme viele Möglichkeiten seinen Char auszuspielen. Viele Skill möglichkeiten von Fahigkeiten und der PvP kommt auch nicht zu kurz. Die Dungeons sind mit liebe gestaltet und sind sehr schön anzuschauen. Die Mechaniken laden zum Grübeln ein in jeden Dungeon. 

Mir gefallen die vielen Deteils im Spiel. Die wunderschön gestallteten Märke, die riesiegen Städte, eine große vielfallt an Landschaften, die ganzen pets und Reittiere die mal selber zähmen und upgraden kann und noch so viel mehr.

Yes, there were a few bumps in the road when it launched which they absolutely should have had under control in the first place with it being a 7 year old game. 
Maybe it's because it was bought by a different company that was inexperienced? I can't say for sure.

Pros -it's simple and to the point for an mmo. 
you can tame 90% of anything you come across - aside from humanoids.
The classes that are available seem true to their purpose thus far- further balancing will be incoming to improve it.
Pretty customizable character creator - not BDO or Saints Row level - but something in between GW2, Dragon Age and BnS bc of the sliders and grid slider. 
It's a fun game. Nothing truly new or original though. - no game changers. 
They emphasize group play. 
There are more but I haven't gotten too far in yet.


Cons- Translation is wonky at times. 
can't play all the races or classes yet.
horrible chat filter that you can't change or take off.
graphics are not anything special, kinda outdated. Tera graphics basically.
Still in early stage (for us) and people are expecting too much out of a game that was gutted to appeal to us.
The cash shop currency is not account bound, it is character bound. But that is supposedly going to be fixed.



Other things: it's not as grindy as BDO - feels alot like BnS but the involvement of us in the personal story isn't as good (Thus far) im only level 18.

This did not make me hate the game, I actually expected this during launch like many other games. They reacted quick and added several more servers.

I do not have bad FPS, every now and than it will drop down to 20 and back up to 80+. I did do the INI fixes and lowered my quality to the 2 notch. Most people are on 3 or higher.  The fps is low when you first log in but after about a minute it will jump back up.

The problem I had with this game is that the combat system is just not smooth enough. There is defintely a delay in chain skills and it is really hard to see if you are low on mana for a skill. You pretty much just sit there because there is NO AUTO ATTACK or mana pots that I could easily locate. I had easy time on my mage, however, paladin is constantly out of mana. Another problem with the combat is you are constantly ambushed without warning and classes that don't have aoes struggle against it.

The second problem is the fact that duping already exist. I wanted a fresh start on a mmo that I could race and keep up with people which is why I was attracted to Bless, however, the fact duping already exist before the 2 day early access is already up and several people are taking advantage of it just ruins the mood to play. I can't keep up with people who are duping. The market is already going to be screwed because of that and there is not really anything they can do to fix it but change the currency.

In the current state of the game, its really up to the player to consider whether they like it or not. I'd recommend at least trying the game and decide for yourself if you want to play it or not. Personally I think combat is pretty solid, though classes need some tweaking and adjusting. 

As for optimization, the devs did a few fixes to the game, though most of solutions for those problems will come from adjustments to the .ini files, which usually doesn't look great for the devs. With the fixes, the game will run fairly smooth, although you might have drops in extremely crowded areas.

Overall the game is fairly decent at the time of this reveiw, it has a better launch than a few mmo's out there and the devs are very communicative.

Throughout the years I've learned to not get too hyped about a game before it's release - to relieve the expectations around what the game in my head should be before it releases.  Being that the game is in EARLY ACCESS, I have opted to buy a pre-release version of the game.  Whatever the version of the game is called, traditionally this is a beta.  The game development is in progress and all of the features are not fully implemented or completed.

The game is enjoyable to me regardless of the state.  The story is decent, combat mechanics are a-symetrical to the typical MMO, and the graphics are pleasing.  Is this a ground breaking MMO?  No.  However, I am having fun playing it and taking my time with it knowing it is a work in progress.  If the majority of the people who are giving this game a negative review would step back and realize what they were buying beforehand, maybe their expectations would differ.

Don't buy the game if you are expecting a completed product.  Buy this game if you want to take your time and see progression of the game as you play.

0,142,5,1255,1255,76561198000003168,0,english,False,42434226,"Shakey launch but that is every MMO launch ever. Was completely fine with receiving a good portion of free cash shop currency to make up for the issues playing. 

The fact that some servers ended up being locked for character creation is upsetting but when a large influx of people rush into the game it is expected. WoW realms have queue times on servers at peak capacity as do other MMO's. FFXIV locks character creation on most of the high population realms throughout the day and if you want to play there you sit and wait. I understand that there wasn't clear communication regarding whether or not the game would have megaservers but before the game released all that was said was there would be 1 server for NA and more would be created if server population was too high. That statement to me implied not a megaserver but rather individual realms like in WoW. I get the frustration from those who took that statement a different way. However now that population has stabilized they are allowing persons to transfer their founder edition items to a new character on the realm of their choice, yes you will have to level up again but playing the game is just fun in general.

Action combat. While this didn't directly effect me as I do like tab-targetting I can understand the frustration at the idea that they took away something that was promised upon release. I've seen a lot of people in-game complaining that they thought action cam was for all classes when it was only stated that it would be for a few (ranger, mage, zerker). While action combat would be nice the fact that they are actively improving it before implementing it in game will hopefully hinder or outright stop any bugs or issues that arise with its arrival. 

The combat system. I just plain enjoy it. I like the idea of combo'ing my skills and while it would be nice to swap skills around and have the perfect combo balancing classes would most likely become an impossible task. 

End-game content. I guess it wasn't made available enough for the masses but the lack of content at end-game was discussed and mentioned before the game released and was discussed being a rolling-release nothing about that strikes me as wrong or dishonest. If you were just buying the game based around the hype and did no research you shouldn't be upset about something that a simple google search could tell you. The rolling release also makes it easier to monitor any bugs or issues that may arise and then for the devs to act upon and fix before another major release. If they just dropped everything at once it would be a crapshoot with a lot more work put upon the devs and a lot more moaning from the community. 

You can buy dungeon teleports with cash shop money. Listen, if you are so scared of dying running to a dungeon that you have to spend money to instantly teleport there maybe a PvP-oriented game isn't for you. I have no problem with people spending money to teleport to a dungeon if they so wish that is not p2w at all. Just because they can hop back and forth from town to dungeon isn't going to break the economy, especially with a timer on your home teleport rune. 

Duping. I think this is the most serious issue facing the game and the developers have already stated they are aware and executing bans and doling out punishments to those who abused it. While it would have been nice for the punishment to be more severe the duping was a result of server lag and a lot of people may have unintentionally duped so I understand the hesitation of punishing accidental dupers.

""No refunds"". I don't understand how some people got it into their heads that the no refunds was from Neowiz. It is Steam policy that if some third-party DLC affects a character in a game (costumes, in-game currency) they will be marked as non-refundable and generally are. It is up to Steam whether or not to refund these DLC purchases. In-game purchases however are on Neowiz and as I haven't purchased any kind of cash shop currency I cannot speak as to whether or not they will or will not offer you a refund for that specific type of purchase.

All in all I think that because Bless Online was hyped up and is one of the very few MMO's that have recently been and are still being released gave a lot of customer's hope for the next big thing and they felt cheated when they didn't fully research what they were buying into.

I only have about 14 hours into the game so far but I am enjoying my time spent in it immensely and will update it this review at a later time if I believe it to be necessary.

Que le but d'un jeu pvp RvR n'est pas d'avoir du ""contenu"" ou des tonnes de donjons, mais bien de laisser aux joueurs la possibilité d'aller fight le camp ennemi sans avoir besoin d'une quête qui vous dit quoi faire.

Pour tout ceux qui ralent après une soit-disant gestion catastrophique, je pense que ceux là n'ont pas connu beaucoup de lancements de mmo pour dire ça. Quand je vois la catastrophe qu'a été Archeage à son démarrage (je parle de la gestion de Trion, pas du contenu du jeu), ou alors le déséquilibre complet du pvp dans Riders of Icarus, et du temps qu'il a fallu à ces deux jeux pour corriger tous ces problèmes.

Alors oui Bless n'est pas parfait, et il connait quelques problèmes de démarrage, mais comme presque tous les mmo, mais après seulement quelques jours, ils ont déjà ajouté de nouveaux serveurs, réglé en partie les problèmes d'instabilité et de file d'attente, on est trés loin des 4heures de file d'attente qu'il fallait pour accéder aux serveurs d'archeage à ses débuts...
On a déjà un premier patch qui ajoute du contenu BG pvp et équilibrage des classes suite aux retours des joueurs, 5 jours seulement après le lancement du headstart. Franchement peu d'éditeurs peuvent en dire autant.

Oui certains serveurs sont lockés et c'est chiant pour ceux qui veulent rejoindre leurs potes, mais la contre-partie est que nous n'avons plus ni file d'attente, ni lag. Et nous avons déjà reçu une compensation pour dédommager la frustration que peut engendrer les quelques désagréments que nous avons connus. Citez moi un autre mmo où ils ont été aussi rapide ?

Etant un habitué des mmo RvR (Regnum Online, DAoC, Archeage) je ne me fait pas d'inquiètude concernant le temps de jeu HL. Surtout si le studio continue d'écouter les joueurs pour les prochains équilibrages.

Concernant le moteur du jeu, je trouve les graphismes plutôt soignés, et je n'ai aucun lag. Mais j'ai une très bonne config, je ne sais pas ce que ça donne sur les pc moyen.

I played the Japanese version and the new combat design is engaging and refreshing. Damage balancing is still in the works and they should've worked that out before Early Access or just labeled it as beta and I feel people wouldn't be so critical. However, they are very attentive to the community and have released 2 patches already with the largest today adjusting damage, which they scaled back too much. 

This game's focus is primarily PvP and possibly end game raiding, but primarily PvP. The game is beautiful but the translations are poorly done. If you are role player or love PvE, this isn't the game for you. If you love PvP and go into this knowing many changes are to come I think you will be happy.

A few changes that are needed aside from balancing are runes not breaking on death and possibly just adding repair costs to them. They also need more means to acquire money end game. Items are saturated on the auction house and crappy vendored weapon armor drops are too scarce. They drop appropriately up until after the 22 dungeon, but thereafter most endgame dungeons have a lockout timer and they don't drop frequently enough in the 37 dungeon.  Rare grade weapons also should vendor more than the common drops, which isn't the case.

I personally like the graphics and don't have any issues with performance. The ini tweaks helped a lot as well and I play at high graphic quality with a pretty consistant 60 fps (35 - 40  in major cities). I also really like the most recent patch to lower damage as it was a little absurd I was killing mobs 4 or 5 levels above mine in 1 or 2 hits. This should also make pvp more enjoyable instead of constantly getting one shotted.

The combat is a ton of fun in my opinion, people seemed to think this was going to be a new amazing action combat game and quit just because the action combat is minimal only available to one class. I'm ok with this I enjoy tabbed targeting, i was an avid player of FFXIV and WoW. It feels reponsive and good.

My only gripe about the game thus far was how much they underestimated the launch week player base population. Only having 2 servers on day one was a huge mistake in my opinion and I pretty much saw it coming. After the first week though things are calming down again and the servers are balancing out.

There will be enough place to farm/grind for almost everyone, there will be no more queue if you guys make bigger servers, which i personally think it would increase the playerbase for sure.

После этого она вышла в Корее: кривой, не оптимизированной и с кучей проблем. Такой она пришла и к нам. Чем закончилась эта история - мы все знаем. И вот, разработчики взялись творить Rebuild!

Что же из этого вышло? Да НИЧЕГО! В игре сохранились все те же проблемы: просадки FPS, ошибки геодаты (привет мобам в текстурах), непонятное окно квестов (когда собираешь предметы, то на экране не отображается информация, типа ""собрана 1 кость из 8""). В добавок к этому, игра вышла на английском и немецком языках. Но даже это не так печалит! Проблема в том, что игра перешла на buy-to-play модель, а это ОЧЕНЬ высокая планка, поскольку в сегодняшнем ММО-секторе далеко не многие проекты могут себе позволить такую роскошь!

Игра просто не заслуживает своих денег! Все это время разработчики переделывали систему заточки, крафта, скиллов и умений, но они ВООБЩЕ не занимались оптимизацией игры! И подтврждением этому служат конфиги, выложенные на Reddit'e в те времена, когда игра лагала, как с...ка! Конфиги многолетней давности подошли к сегодняшнему Блессу, пришедшему после ребилда. Нас просто нае...ли в 3-ий раз! Никому НЕ РЕКОМЕНДУЮ жрать это го...но! Если вы уважаете себя и хотите найти достойные игры buy-to-play сектора, то идите играть в Guild Wars 2, TESO или WoW.

The combat feels fluid as a paladin with many things to consider, such as applying a DoT and maintaining it with other skills.

Optimization: Not good. The developers already said it's their TOP PRIORITY right now to boost performance. AND you can find a lot of tweaks on Bless reddit that will make your game run smoothly.

Combat: So far so good. It's fun to grind mobs, practice your combos and PVP other players. My only complain is that the combos would feel much better if they were sped up a little bit, because when you switch from one skill to another it takes a little time to follow up.

Pay to Win: NOPE. Not at all. Most items in cash shop are skins. Premium membership? Totally not needed, may speed up your leveling and gold making a little bit.

Leveling: Really good and fun. I swear to god you will play the questline for dozens of hours without finding repetitive places or monsters. It's refreshing and every new zone is entirely different.

PVP: The first days were dominated by one-shotting people. But the game is out for less than a week and there's already a new patch fixing these DPS problems in PVP, that means developers are aware of these problems.

Translation: REALLY BAD. I won't lie, this is something that is annoying me. Not being able to understand what a certain skill or upgrade does sucks. You need to learn by testing your skills or watching streamers, youtubers that have more knowledge. BUT the game was just realeased, so expect this to change over next months.

Exploration: Awesome. The maps are beautiful, and you can walk around for hours farming pets, mounts, materials for your crafting skills, getting some world pvp action, and you won't get bored.

So, should you buy it?
If you love MMORPGS and look for a new refreshing experience, I would say YES.

0,161,35,715,715,76561197980150152,0,english,False,42428690,"TLDR: Decent character creator and you can tame just about anything to be a mount or pet. Those are the only pros. Latest damage nerf update turned what felt like a mindless grind, into an ENDLESS grind. The game doesn't do anything majorly different from other MMOs, it is almost a copy and past of other MMOs. Create character, pick class, get quest, run to point, kill things, spam your skills until you or it dies, run back to quest giver, get new quest, run (sometimes to same exact place), kill things (sometime same exact things), rinse and repeat. 

Sound engineer should be flippin fired for having so many voice overs peak like they do. Sounds like it was all recorded on an xbox headset. 

Graphics: Player models are astounding, yet everything else is mostly 1/8 the resolution or tessalation that player model is. 

World size: Huge, it feels like everyone was shrunken down to make walking places take that much longer. 

Crafting: Nothing new here, spend hours gathering resources spread thin around the world, make a handfull of items that get used up quicker than it took to get them. 

Storyline: doesn't matter, just spam F to skip, you won't miss anything. No decision making, no choices, nothing worth reading.

Mounts: Slow, maybe 20% faster than walking. There are flying ones, thats cool for some. Minigame to tame will be easy for some and hella frustrating for others. The stamina thing isn't great. Jumping depletes it with a dozen jumps and then you have to make feed or buy it which doesn't replenish much. It doesn't regen very fast when you aren't riding them or when you're offline. 

Dying: You lose nothing, your soul respawns semi far away, you have to walk back to your body then can respawn in the flesh, you won't respawn with much health or stamina so if you died near enemy, you'll likely die again.

Junk items: Like other MMOs there are junk items that mobs drop and it will fill your inventory fast. They don't sell for much and are completely useless for crafting. It's too bad they couldn't do something like Runescape where every drop is useful for something. 

Weapon drops: Sometimes mobs drop weapons but depending on your level you will get the same weapons over and over again. For example if you get 10 weapons and 4 of them are for your class, they will be identical. 

Performance: Im rockin an AMD setup, FX 8350 cpu, R9 390 nitro gpu, 16 gigs 2133 ram, and stored on an SSD. I got a nice 60 FPS on the tutorial island, but since I left, I've struggled to get over 30 on medium settings. Sometimes it drops to the teens. No Vsync that I could find. Doesn't see mouse buttons as bindable. Doesn't seem to be mouse sensitivity adjustment either. I could be blind though or maybe their menus are just that cluttered.

There aren't many other things to do besides quest and craft items at the moment. Some mini games or side games would be great. But all it is now is grind grind grind and with new update it's grind grind grind grind grind grind grind grind. PS I got this game as a gift.

Combat/Gameplay: The combo system is slow at first for every class, but once you unlock more combos/upgrades it becomes very pleasant to use.  Taming isnt a fun experience, but it isnt a bad one either.  It is over quickly and doesnt punish you for a mistake (the mob might though :P ).

Graphics: Not top tier, but very high mid tier; assuming you can run it on max settings. Animations need work but they are not the worst I have seen by a long shot.

OPTIMIZATION:  You will need to edit some .ini settings and adjust your systems GPU to be more efficient (this took me 5 minutes with a detailed guide).  My processor is my bottleneck, I have a 1080 and 16gb ram, and I am seeing consistent FPS at 45.  I dip to about 25-30 upon first entering a city but it quickly pops back up.

Music: Top tier....nuff said

Translations:  Not very well done, but after playing a couple hours you will know what does what regardless.  I found this to be a non-issue.

In many ways, that makes us somewhat of a captive audience, but I'm developing Stockholm Syndrome.

This coupled with failed launches elsewhere (albeit under a publisher it no longer is), a rocky launch in the West (It's an MMO so that's almost par for the course), and less than forthcoming devs, has lead to a barrage of negativity tantamount to No Man's Sky-gate.

So ich habs ein bisschen Gespielt nun und nach diesem furchtbaren Nerfpatch ist mir der Kragen geplatzt:

Ich habe keine Probleme mit Startschwierigkeiten von Spielen wie MMORPGs jeder weiß das am Anfang die server nicht reibungslos ablaufen. Das was ich bemängle ist der Betrug an Versprechungen die nicht eingehalten wurden/ vlt auch nie einghalten werden. Zum einen das Action-Combat-System welches versprochen wurde und doch nicht implementiert ist und vlt auch garnicht eingebaut wird (oder vlt doch?). Dazu kommt diese furchtbar alte Grafik welche ich durchaus verzeihen könnte wenn der Rest passt wie das Gameplay welches jetzt mit dem Nerfpatch nahezu zerstört worden ist. 

Ein weiteres gewaltiges Problem ist der sogenannte DUPE-Bug welches durch zufälliges oder gezieltes Lagging eine duplikation im AH verursacht dadurch haben manche Spieler bereits Max Equipment und X-Tausend Gold.

Die armselige Optimierung des Spiels setzt dem Ganzen noch einen drauf mann die Fehler der Devs selbst in den Ini dateien beheben um Vernünftiges spielen zu ermöglichen. Es gibt keine Entschuldigung für sowas das Spiele ist nun zum 3ten mal Released worden und ist seit 2009 in Entwicklung. Ganz zu schweigen von Fails in den anderen Ländern wie zB Russland sollten die Devs genug Erfahrung gesammelt haben um solche Fehler vermeiden zu können und eine Optimierung des Spiels nach all der Zeit passiert sein sollte. 

Wie es aussieht betteln die Entwickler um schlechte Kritik und wollen ihr Spiel in den Abgrund versenken.
Falls sie sich doch noch sich besinnen, werde ich mein Review ändern sobald es sich zum positiven Gewandelt hat.

So I played it a bit now and after this terrible Nerfpatch my collar burst:

I have no problems starting games like MMORPGs everyone knows that in the beginning the servers will not run smoothly. What I complain about is the scam of promises that were not kept / vlt never be met. On the one hand, the action combat system which was promised and yet not implemented and vlt is also not installed. Add to that this awful old graphics which I could forgive if the rest fits like the gameplay which has now been nearly destroyed with the Nerfpatch.

Another huge problem is the so-called DUPE bug, which causes a duplication in the AH due to random or targeted lagging. Some players already have Max Equipment and X-Thousand Gold.

The poor optimization of the game puts the whole thing on it man the errors of the devs even in the ini files fix to allow to play reasonably. There is no excuse for something like that. The game has now been released for the 3rd time and has been in development since 2009. Not to mention Fails in other countries such as Russia, the devs should have had enough experience to avoid such mistakes and an optimization of the game should have happened after all this time.

Today, something I could 1 shot yesterday, takes me 6 skills.. and as a mage, for example, I can barely survive a 1v1 with trash mobs, and if you miss a skill.. it's just death. t.t I feel forced to group up to progress, and I simply do not want to.

Ok so here we are, worth the money for founders? not even, base price? i mean sure, it's a back shelf game, not anywhere near what i'd refer to as a AAA title. Guilds are fine, guild wars are fine, but try to get in the biggest guild asap, or you'll be ganked by 50 members of 1 guild that are 10 levels above you ( if you forget your peace buff 5s from store ) It's annoying and nothing more than an inconvenience so don't get all puffy chested ( that and even 10 v 1 when you're 10 levels higher, just makes you a poosey lol ) Tangent offline. 

they added battle grounds, maybe that will breath some life into the game? we'll see, but at the min i'm taking a few weeks off, because i know the game will be exactly the same when i return lol 

These opinions are just my own ( Frame drop / disconnects / lag /  UI / The combat is poop /  it's going to take a while to balance the classes / end game content / expecto - disconnects-o / DX9 ) 

Good stuff? um .. There's people in the game, and um ... i dunno it's nice in areas and some of the mobs are cool, having to use some mechanics during boss fights, This game is like GW2 meets Tera meets dunno :S The gear is easy to get, but money is rough to make, so start saving fast, don't spent that needed moolar lol

i3 8100
16 gb ram
GTX 1060 6gb

I get 45-60 fps outside of extremely populated areas with this cheaper set up without any ini tweaks. I'm completely fine with this because it's very smooth and doesn't stutter at all. (It didn't even stutter on the first day when I was in the main city when there was only one server. The FPS was atrocious but it never felt like a slideshow.  )


Pros:

Combat: The combat is really fun. I like customizing my play style a lot and even within my 1 class there seems to be a good variety to choose from. How it works is you get to use 2 stances out of 6 and each stance has 3 skills which can combo into 2 more skills. Each skill and stance can be modified one of two ways. Then you have a handful of non stance skills that can be customized and upgraded 3 different ways. On top of that you have passive abilities that have 4 different paths to take. 

Character creation: I've never felt a character customization that was quite this robust. I really enjoyed customizing my character more than any other game. Most MMOs only allow you to change your body in very small ways with most customization around the face(which isn't seen in most gameplay). This one allowed you to have huge biceps or super short or super tall or fat while maintaining immersion by not making ridiculous proportions. I enjoyed it a lot.

Taming: I haven't really gotten into it but taming definitely intrigues me and it looks like it's well done and fully fleshed out even in early access. It feels like almost every non-humanoid can be made into a mount or a pet and for those of us that grew up on Pokemon all I have to say is ""Gotta catch 'em all!""

Developer communication: It's refreshing to see such communication and responsiveness from a developer team. They are fixing the issues that come up quickly and doing a good job squashing the problems. They claim they will never make the game P2W and looking at the cash shop it looks like this was a true statement.


Cons:

Translation errors:  Every patch it seems they fix some translation error but there definitely was a lot at launch. Most of the large issues within skills and some of the main quest line have been fixed but this will probably plague the game throughout early access. As someone who plays MMOs for combat and gear progression most of the translation errors are easily looked past by me but some people will be upset with this. 

Optimization issues: When enough people come onto the screen it is very hard for the game to render them all and 100v100s and GvGs are going to be extreme lag fest and hopefully they can fix some of these issues before this becomes a large problem. 

Server issues: Now that the community is spread out through several servers this doesn't seem to be an issue but it was a mess at the beginning when they said that the game was going to have one megaserver, then one became 3, became 5, became however many there are now. This was such a big issue that my guild was split up between multiple servers with people with fast connections and the $150 founders pack refusing to leave Tanara to go to a less populated server and other people that couldn't play until Wednesday unable to make new characters on Tanara...and it was just a mess so much that people prematurely opted for refunds and it ended up making the guild explode. And we were a relatively smaller guild so I'm curious what happened to larger guilds.

I downloaded an app called ""Unlock CPU"", which enables all the cores of your computer with one click (you`ll use a bit more energy, but the performance`ll improve a lot) and I gained 20-30 fps with this. Then, there is a post on Redit teaching how to optimze your game by editing the engine file (very easy to do, did in 5mins).

CONS
- Unfinished product. It shows pretty badly to be honest, but this can also be noted as a positive since it will only improve with updates. 
- Voice Acting on Hieron side is god awful. Cringeworthy at times. For some reason the Union side is fine, but the Hieron side at least at the start is... r-really bad. 
- Combat feels clunky when you get started. It really takes some getting used to, but is quite fun when you get used to it. But starting out is quite rough. Make sure you change the key bindings to make it more fluid for yourself. 
- The action combat camera option thing is not available for any class besides beserker. I play zerker, so this isn't an issue for me, but I would want it on all of my classes so that's a problem. 
- Optimization. It doesn't exsist. I have quite a good laptop here, Alienware 17"" with an i7 and a geforce GTX 1070, and I am having the absolute worst time getting the damn thing to run without massive FPS issues. I had to turn the graphics down to 1. Hopefully with some googling and ini tinkering I can fix this, but as it stands, it's really bad and an issue for anyone not knowledgeable in tinkering with ini files and such. 
- Translations. They're just bad, but again this is an unfinished product so I hope that they will get better. 
- Faction Lock per server. This isn't a huge issue, but annoy for people like me who like to make lots of alts or have friends on the side faction side. So, just know about it ahead of time. 

PROS
- Responsive dev team! This is a huge thing for me at least, because a game that doesn't listen to its audience is pretty useless. So the dev team really puts their work out there and listens to the community and has a cool emissary program to collect feedback! So, that's pretty great. 
- Combat is fun, when you get used to it! Like I said in the con section, its clunky to start but when you change up the key binds, it becomes fluid and fun. 
- A lot of content to come. And we already know about a lot of it, but there's new races, new classes, just like. a bunch of new stuff already in the works and on the way. So I always find that awesome and exciting. 
- Nice graphics. It's a bit older of a game, but if you like that eastern very pretty aesthetic, then you'll find this game very beautiful, even if you have to turn down the graphics to 1 to play the darn thing. 


SO, in conclusion; If you're already invested in another MMO that you love, maybe it's not worth your time. If you're looking for a polished and perfectly finished game, maybe also not worth your time, but check back with it in a few months to see where it's at. But if you're looking for some new MMO to mess about it and just explore and have fun with friends, then this would be a good fit. If you're looking to spend your last $30 to your name, maybe not here, but a good pick up if you have spare cash, spare time, and just wanna play around in a pretty world with fun combat.

Fangen wir mal ganz klassisch mit 'ner Pro- und Contraliste an.

Pro:
+ Nette Grafik
+ Große offene Welt
+ Viele zähmbare Tiere die man entweder als Pet oder Mount benutzen kann
+ Interessante Klassen die alle ihr eigenes Konzept haben
+ Tab-Targeting (diskutables Thema für viele, aber als jahrelanger WoW und Guildwars 1/2 Spieler gefällt mir dieses System bis heute noch am besten)
+ Content wird schnell nachgeliefert und Probleme werden in Angriff genommen
+ Viele Optionen manuell einstellbar durch konfigurierbare .ini Dateien
+ Kein P2W
+ Kampfsystem auf Kombos basierend, auch ganz gut gemacht da es sich sehr flüssig anfühlt

Contra:
- Technisch kompletter total Ausfall
- Systemanforderungen viel zu hoch
- Skills nur durch Echtgeldwährung zurücksetzbar


Erstmal zu mir: Ich habe von dem Spiel erst ca. 5h vor dem EA Start durch nen Kumpel erfahren und bin daher ohne Hype oder sonstige Erwartungen an das Spiel gegangen.

Reden wir zunächst mal von dem erwähnten ""technischen total Ausfall"": Das Spiel ist einfach scheisse optimiert, wie die meisten Spiele aus dem asiatischen Raum. Viele Dinge muss man manuell in den .ini Datei fixen um das Spiel auf eine brauchbare Framerate zu bekommen und um Framedrops zu minimieren. Wird es dadurch zu einem schlechten Spiel mit dem man keinen Spaß haben kann ? Meiner Meinung nach nicht, da der Spaß für mich durchs Gameplay entsteht welchen ich durch das Kombo-Kampfsystem habe. Es ist schnell, man ist flexibel, da man (vorallem als Magier) nicht an einen Ort gebunden ist beim Zaubern, es werden einem viele Entwicklungs- u. Buildoptionen geboten mit denen man seinen Charakter ganz seinem eingen Spielstil anpassen kann (sofern man kein 0815 Meta-Spieler ist der meint alles kopieren zu müssen von dem es heißt es sei ""das beste Build""), dazu kommt noch das Taming System durch das einem zig Begleiter und Mounts zur verfügung stehen.

Entgegen der Meinung vieler anderer hatte ich nicht einen einzigen Disconnect in meinen 12h Spielzeit und auch kein bisschen Lag, ich hab das Spiel am 31.5 gekauft. Der Serverlock wurde aufgehoben und zur Zeit können auf jedem Server bei beiden Fraktionen wieder Charaktere erstellt werden. Es gibt bis jetzt täglich einen Hotfix und heute (1.6.18) wurde auch schon das erste Pvp-Schlachtfeld nachgeliefert. Was mir zeigt, dass die Devs daran interessiert sind die Startschwierigkeiten schnell aus der Welt zu räumen. Was man da in Zukunft noch erwarten kann wird man demnächst sehen aber momentan bin ich positiv gestimmt.

Ein letztes Wort noch zu den Systemanforderungen: Ich spiele das Spiel auf einem extrem schwachen System (Fx 4300, 1050 ti, 8gb ram) und ich erhalte mit allen Anpassungen fast durchgehend 40fps+ mit Grafik auf Stufe 3-4 bei ner 1600x900 Auflösung.

0,22,8,253,253,76561198054257940,0,english,False,42425673,"Well, there is a ""something"" about BLESS that I really like and that got me attracted since I saw it.
I think it's called ""intellectual property"". The playable races (I think it's rather species, but whatever). The idea of fractions. The good, ol' MMORPG style that does NOT try to re-invent the wheel. All that combine to what I think is what I want.

I, a 27-year old, grown man, have a weakness: Whenever there is a small, playable race, I am in. Might it be the Yordles from LoL, or the Lalafell in FFXIV, or my two Asura in GW2. When I saw the Mascu, BLESS came up high in my interest. That was like 2 years ago. And a couple of days ago, I had it ""on my radar"" again. I've read through reviews that are so full of hate and bullshit equally, full threads of discussions on how bad it is. Funny though, I realized later, it's always the same guys echo-chambering each other. The ONE post in that thread about how nice BLESS is, had more upvotes than the others.. All the uproar about the failed start... I have a deja vu regards my GTX970, where everybody was hating' about the card and nVidia - while I was happy with my graphics card. My point? I am so far very happy with BLESS - no matter what others say.

Of course, a lot is strange or awful, but it's almost immediately followed by something I really like. So far, it's like a roller coaster: 
+ The character selection/creation is well-done
+ The Mascu
- The tutorial is totall bullocks: No explanation why I am there apart from ""I am hurt in battle"" or something. Then it tells me to press button X and Y. I do so. ""X and Y pressed. You know now how to fight"". WHAT? My jaw dropped in disbelief. Next step: Skill menu. ""Press Z button do Y"". I press ""Z"". ""Good job, now you changed a skill"". Me: ??? Then a giant monster is spawned, kills me in one hit. ""Oh, and this is what happens when you die. Press RESSURECT"". Such a Bull!
+ After that, there is a nice cutscene with voice over on board of a Mascu airship. I really liked that!
- I fight off 3 (!) one-hit (!) beetles before...
+ ...Mrs. Mascu captain of the airship shows up.
- Then the loading screen ends despite I still load (HDD LED flickers) for like 1 minute. During that time, I have 10fps (Ryzen 1700X / GTX1080 / 16 GByte RAM). 
+ After this, the game is smooth.
+ I am in the airship wharf and look into a nice town with ropeways that move in the distance and all that! Awesome!
- ...just to see the surrounding mountains are bland - no tress or bushes. Like a fresh terraform map in CITIES SKYLINES..
+ So I descent into the wharf and hear the sound effects have correct reverb because of me being inside a building
+ And a light haning over a big, spinning fan in the lobby of the wharf creates a nice dynamic lighting that made the whole scenery believable.

So there is MUCH to change and improve. Especially the weird camera that works ALMOST as expected but made me run off a cliff once. But so far, I got hooked somewhat. Not that much super hyped, but at work today, I really was looking forward for coming home and trying further. Can I recommend it as Early Access: Yes.

Comecei a jogar no dia 30/05 e não tive problemas com as filas de servidores, só levei um disconect durante todas as horas que eu joguei e considero isso super normal.

Jogo com um processador i7. 7700, 16gb de ram e uma gtx 1070, até o momento mantive as configurações no modo 4 tanto na cidade quanto fora dela, (não quis colocar no 5 por gosto mesmo). Não tive problemas com FPS, é claro que na cidade, especialmente próximo ao mercado, o fps é menor, para mim é comum de todo MMO.
Estou me divertindo bastante com o jogo, algo que não consegui com os últimos MMOS que joguei, a comunidade no discord Bless Online BR é bem participativa, e em especial na minha guild também.
Eu gosto de jogar solo, mas os benefícios de andar em Party valem a pena estar em grupo, mesmo que você não esteja jogando com alguém e só por estar em party já tem um bônus, de mesmo modo a guild também da um bônus mt interessante.

Tirando o EA do jogo que foi um pouco perturbador (pelo que eu li), agora está ótimo e vale a pena jogar!! Ótimo jogo até o momento, espero que a produtora continue arrumando os problemas, ainda existem, mas não são tão graves assim.

Y sinceramente este juego me ha sacado de lo que ""ya habia"". Joder que es un early access y aparte de tirones al cargar el juego (que en dos minutos se quitan y juegas de putisima madre) es el único en el genero que me está haciendo vivirlo, leer la historia, decidir que hacer en cada momento, cuando no quiero seguir la historia y estoy en una zona de monstruos preciosa, me dedico a disfrutar de las vistas y cazar monstruos hasta que me den las recompensas xD

Me encanta, lo adoro.

Y Haters... Fallos hay en todos los juegos incluso en los que no son early access. Esta compañía arregla por día pequeños bugs del juego (y optimizaciones). y cabe decir que todos nosotros tomamos decisiones y ellos como compañía tambien lo han hecho, no se le debe reprochar el abrir un server o 500, se cometen fallos a diario y otras decisiones son acertadas.
A lo que me vengo a referir es que la experiencia de juego, la ambientacion en zonas italianas y españolas es PRECIOSO, y el juego es totalmente jugable, variado y nuevo.

Niveau stabilité ça lag un peu dans les grandes villes mais sans plus je trouve et très stable en dehors, sur ma session de quelques heures hier je n'ai eu qu'un crash du jeu.

J'ai atteint le level 16 et fait le premier donjon, par contre je l'ai fait en solo ! Est ce que le niveau s'adapte à la quantité du groupe ? est ce que c'est un choix sur le premier donjon et que la difficulté sera croissante ? Je ne sais pas, et ça m'arrangeait bien pour celui ci, par contre j'espère que ça s'adapte ou que ça évolue quand même un peu.

Il y a quand même pas mal de choses qui me rappellent WOW, que ce soit dans l'interface comme dans les systèmes de jeu (univers heroic fantasy, les transports avec wyvern, bateau ou zeppelin (et non pas teleport! Il faut ""subir"" le transport intégralement et moi ça j'aime!), les montures perso au sol ou volante, les pets, le système de mort, les métiers que j'ai pas encore pris le temps de faire, etc...). Après je n'ai que wow en véritable référent me concernant.

Par contre il se démarque sur pas mal de points aussi:
-On peut tamer n'importe quel animal dans le jeu afin qu'il devienne pet ou monture. On doit s'occuper de ces derniers en les nourrissant pour leur restaurer de l'énergie (sinon par exemple on a plus accès à la monture, donc important de gérer la fatigue de nos montures,etc...).
-D'ailleurs les pets et les montures acquièrent aussi un level à priori (info sure pour les montures) qu'il faut monter sous peine de ne plus pouvoir les utiliser au fur et à mesure (apparemment au level 20 par exemple je dois upgrader ma monture pour qu'elle puisse continuer à m'emmener partout). On monte le level des montures en se déplaçant avec bien évidemment. Les pets je crois qu'ils apportent des buffs en combat, à vérifier...
-Le système de combat, qui se rapproche apparemment plus d'un guild wars (que je ne connais pas à part de nom) est basé sur un système de combo, en fonction des choix faits dans les arbres à talent on privilégiera plus un type de combo que les autres. On peut aussi changer de posture, et notamment en plein combat, ce qui permet de changer complètement les types de combo. J'ai pas encore fait le tour de tout ça et des combos se débloquent au fur et a mesure du level du perso donc j'ai encore beaucoup à découvrir sur ce point. Par contre j'ai rematé des combats high level et je suis très loin de faire ce qu'ils font. Bonne marge de progression donc. En tout cas les combats sont plutôt bien dynamiques et ça c'est cool. Au passage quand j'ai revu les combats high level, j'ai regretté de pas avoir pris le mage ! Ça à l'air de bien poutrer !
-Il y a un système d'autorun avec ciblage, j'entends par là qu'on clique droit sur la carte et on met l'autorun en cours et hop le perso y va seul en prenant le chemin le plus court (l'optimisation du parcours est encore buguée je trouve), l'avantage est que l'on peut checker ses menus en se déplaçant (inventaire, métiers, arbre à talent, etc...) et que les déplacements sont donc moins longs car on peut se concentrer sur autre chose. Par contre on peut pas faire ça et se barrer car le perso risque de passer par des trashes quand même, donc on doit garder un œil dessus.

Pour les trashes, je trouve que c'est un peu trop facile, après je m'aventure plutôt dans les zones inférieures ou égales à mon level pour l'instant, ce qui explique peut être ce ressenti. Mais un peu de difficulté serait bienvenue.

Les villes bien qu'immenses et remplies de joueurs font un peu vides malgré tout, il faudrait mettre des pnj pour ajouter de la vie à mon sens.

Je n'ai pas encore eu le temps de me pencher sur l'aspect pvp qui importe beaucoup pour moi aussi et qui sera essentiel pour une durée de vie conséquente du jeu à terme.

En bref pour le moment je suis assez surpris positivement, et notamment au vu du nombre de commentaires négatifs concernant la stabilité, le jeu est stable et sympa, il garde les principes de base d'un mmorpg et ne déroute pas trop tout en ajoutant quelques nouveautés pour moi. D'ailleurs le retour des commentaires positifs des joueurs ne trompe pas, c'est passé de moins de 40% de commentaires positifs à plus de 50% depuis hier et les différents patchs n'y sont pas pour rien je pense. On sent bien que c'est un jeu sur lequel il y a du taf depuis quelques années mais qui mérite encore pas mal d'amélioration et d'équilibrage, on est loin d'un early access bancal en tout cas, surtout pour un mmorpg.

Yes there will be blind fanboyism. But I will do what I can to keep this as transparent as possible.

Yes, I am 100% aware we received a client that still had dupes, bugs, and glitches from a previous version and I can not let that slide past the review that they blatantly didn't care enough to fix that BEFORE launch. Do I know why? No. And neither do you honestly so stop creating the idea of ""LAZY COMPANY. WANTS GAME TO FAIL"". They spent over a literal fuckton of money to port the game over to the Western servers and they are not going to sit by and let the game crash, or at least if they are smart they wouldn't haha. 

The game had launch problems... What game hasn't? More closely, what MMORPG hasn't? Especially KMMORPGs. Hell we can look at American made games too, it isn't just the Asian MMORPG market. You know that really big MMORPG that everyone is hoping the ""next MMORPG"" kills. That WoW game that every MMORPG is compared to. I know a lot of you are probably too young or just didn't play computer games then. But that launch? MUCH worse than this game. Hell we can come to a more recent date even. Anyone play WoW WoD launch? The servers were down for a week for their more populated servers, so educate yourself before saying the server stability for this launch was bad. That can be drawn to many reasons but people aren't arguing the reason. They are only arguing that it happened. This is one of the smoother launches for MMORPGs that I've every experienced. Now could it have been smoother? Yes. They fucked up thinking that their servers could hold THAT many people all logging in at the same exact time into the game. They should have started with 5+ servers and then cut them down as time went on or something along those lines to make it smoother and keep a ""nicer"" image of their company. But they didn't and it made them look lazy and stupid. I won't back them up or say people are wrong, the servers were shit the first 2-3 days but they have fixed a lot of the issues revolving around with not being able to even play the game, so just give it time as far as optimization is concerned. If that's why you left and refunded or if that's what is keeping you from getting the game then don't get the game. Wait. If you really want to play it but are scared of that, just keep up to date with the game. Stay active in the reddit, read reviews. Formulate your own opinion based on the game from the reviews. See if the negatives outweigh the positives you're concerned about.

Now to the point of making your own opinion. There have been a lot of videos from youtube content creators constantly bashing and destroying everything about this game, names like Cryy, lolhero, LazyPeon, Gaming Lighthouse and many more I'm sure. They are given the right to feel how they want about the game and for the most part, every point that each of these videos made was 100% accurate, I won't discredit them. They got to where they are now for being pretty transparent, but just remember. They aren't you. Yes this game has flaws, and yes it has too many issues that we should not be okay with in 2018. But look through all of the information presented to you, don't copy opinions based on what one person you've watched for years says. My friends (that have never played the game before, all from WoW) all got the game early access. They saw those videos and guess what. They still play the game, because while those videos had a lot of truth behind them, my friends still enjoy the game. Yes it has flaws. But it can still be enjoyable if you focus on having fun and not on attacking every negativity. Now maybe you do that and still don't like the game. Then walk away, refund it and you're good. Don't come back, don't constantly keep going back to shit talk the people that ARE enjoying the game. You only make yourself look like an ass, even if you feel the need to voice your opinion, it really isn't needed. Be happy with your money back and enjoy life, don't stress over a game you already quit. Lol.

Apart from the rant, obviously there is still blind fanboyism and with reason. I absolutely enjoy playing this game. The leveling is fun to me and has been on every re-iteration of the game. The taming system is addicting. The crafting system is an easy but fun grind. Gathering to max level gathering is addicting. I actually feel like I'm going somewhere everytime I get a drop unlike BDO. I played BDO for a significant amount of time and yes getting that one boss drop was exciting. But short lived excitement... I never felt stronger until I spent 2 months grinding the item out to TRI. This game has a different gear system so it isn't a fair comparison, I'm more comparing the feeling of gearing, I actually feel like I'm getting stronger everytime I get a drop. Going form green to blue. From one blue drop to the next always makes me feel like I'm progressing and I'm not even +ing the gear yet. 

TL;DR .... 

Yes the game has flaws but it can still be fun. Give it time to get better or play now. Your decision. 

I love the game and I'm going to continue to play it. :D

The graphics look great, the world is huge and there are no loading screens apart from instances. You can get some object pop-ups and loading stutter here and there when moving fast on a flight, but it's nothing significant.
I love the style of the game, it looks serious, the architecture fits well.

The combat system takes a while getting used to, I suggest mapping the combo keys to something that fits you.
But after a while when you get it right, the combat just flows, cooldowns are almost non-existant, the animations are top, it just feels satisfiyng. It's been a long time since grinding mobs felt fun.

I guess game companies should just spend a month promising the world while spending the entire dev budget on getting people to stay just long enough where refunds become problematic.

- Neowiz is listening to community and has  given us gifts for ""messing up launch"" which they had no reason to do.

Main issues people complain about:

FPS - Optimization 
Simple fix you just follow the ini tweak guide and openGl guide and you can see performance boost well above 30-150 fps Depending on your mahcine. Conclusion Not a problem!


End Game 
Mainly Streamers / Youtubers whining there is no end game beacuse they got lvl 45 within few days guess what game launched couple of days ago (Yes i know it was in korea, japan, Russia) But the combat is not the same! and rather than the end end content they focused on making sure people could play lag was fixed very fast overall decent launch.And they are adding content the pvp battlegrounds and the high end zones within the coming 2 weeks trust me you got time to enjoy what the game has to offer, unless u want to race then go play a fucking race game.
Remember Streamers / Youtubers seem to get most views for the drama they make (Biased Trash talk of muliplie games) or  being a good player.
Conclusion:
Majority of these Streamers / Youtubers are Biased Emmisary are no diffrent they are all people.

Refunding Galore
Due to many of these streamers / youtubers pushing out negative videos, many of them did not even try bless in other region to understand its current situation. Some People did refund within 20hours according to the TOS on steam beacuse of the lag and having hard time conecting to the server also having semi restriction on faction which was easy bypassed by refreshing seems people werent smart enough! 
Conclusion:
Alot of people who did early refund have rebought the game again some are waiting for next weeks content update the game runs smooth with some file tweaks and its fun and they are making sure they are giving the best experince by fixing buggs restarting server to make sure people dont have lag and enjoys the game.

My conclusion to all of this and my recommendation:
Buy the game enjoy it let it grow. ignore this current day of age gamers, we have people seem to get satisfaction of trying to kill games before they even had time to grow into a beautiful fully developed game.

WoW, Everquest, Lineage2, EvE, Aion, Tera and many more all had problems in their launch u know what those games are alive beacuse people was paitent. And back then you didint have Toxic Streamers / Youtubers complain and spittting out negative videos for views (Money)  and act like spoiled brats. Beacuse if we did trust me none of those games above would be doing to well at their launch either and maybe not in their future. 

Let Bless grow into its own potential!
 

These are my own opinions and  my friends who play this game, we all come from a backround of Lineage2, WoW, EvE, Aion, Tera, Archeage, ESO, GW

Once you played L2 for over a decade no game is hard :)

Hope to See you guys in the game!

I could go into a long rant about how they were pretty upfront about what to expect with Early Access but I am sure you have also heard those reasonings too. 

So what parts are good and what parts are bad?

What is good?

-The developers seem to listen to, and care a lot, about feedback and appear to be working fast to appease the ravenous NA/EU community.
-The Graphics are stunning. The game is absolutely Gorgeous.
-The Chain skills, and skill trees are a refreshing take on a tried and true system.
-The Cutscenes, voice acting, and story are top notch.
-Character creation has an insane ammount of options.


What is bad?

-The game is still in development. I won't sugar coat it and the devs aren't trying to hide it. They are trying to make improvements to the game and as a result a lot of content isnt currently implemented. This includes 3 classes (Assassin, Mystic, Warlock), endgame (although I believe they added 15v15 RvR today), and optimization is rough.
-Optimization - The dev team is working on making this happen. Currently the only fix is to have their recommended requirements as well as fixing an ini file manually in order to improve preformance. That being said. I have an i5 and a Nvidia 1060 (6gb) and I have little to no issues running the game. 
-Translation - The text translation in the game is awful. You need to use an external site to look up what spell abilities actually do. To me, this is an easy fix probably on their end and will just take time.

Should you buy it?

That is up to you. Plain and simple. If you don't mind paying to play a game that is still in development then I would get it.

I am having a blast and I absolutely love the game and the communication the devs have had with its player base. They issued an apology and free in game currency to make up for the rough Early Access Launch. I think a lot of people are making assumptions based on the games history in other countries. I am more than willing to give Neowiz a chance based on what I have seen from them recently.

If you don't want to pay to play a game that is basically still in beta, then do not purchase Bless and wait until more updates and an official launch comes out. It is that simple. 

I am going back to playing now because I am personally enjoying it and just wanted to add my two cents to this crazy commotion coming out of NA surrounding this Early Access Launch and hopefully set the record straight from my point of view.

The majority of issues from the two-day head start are gone. The servers are stable and character creation restrictions were lifted early morning of the fourth day of access (a one day wait for standard game passes). All-in-all, they sorted out the launch woes quickly.

It appears that the issues came down to more people than expected (they couldn't do preorders for an estimate as a first-time Early Access publisher on Stream) and AWS database servers that couldn't handle the amount of I/O generated by the load. They quickly launched additional servers and paid for higher tier database servers that they were able to swap to with a one- hour maintenance during the first two days.

By the actual Early Access launch day (Wednesday), they fixed the loading screen issue where people were getting stuck. As compensation for users that had to endure the issues from the first two days, they provided $20 of the game's premium currency. Owners that recieved and accepted friend copies of the game via Collector's editions also recieved the compensation.

TLDR;
Nerf caused leveling to be slow/mundane boring.
Nerf caused the rotation sytems to ironically show that there was only 1 ideal rotation, and the only time you'd do another rotation is because the ideal rotation was on cooldown.
I'd rather have Auto-attack, than a forced system like that instead of it being intelligent/dynamic - say a buff/debuff to self/target to encourage the A-1-2-3 chain versus the B-1-2-3 or C-1-2-3 chains. 
Nerf caused PVP to be drawn out. (fights lasting over two minutes. <boring to me>)
Nerf caused dungeons to feel more like a tediance than anything fun. 
There needs to be server mergers, since..... now there's a dearth of players that you can't even find ppl to do the dungeons with.


Just not worth your time as an mmo unfortunately. 
You'd be much better off spending your $ on an indie game that'd give you actual enjoyment for the majority of it's content, albeit even if it's limited. 
This game will feel drawn out, and just. bad.

Hopefully I can get this refunded since..... the game pretty much lied to it's players on several levels. And I don't even mean it being early access, I mostly mean with the damage nerf. This shouldn't of been something that would of happened unless it was an Alpha closed beta game. The game was alright before it, say a 6/10, but it turned to a 3/10-rough 4/10 with the change, in less than the 5 days of it being out. 


i wouldn't be in any rush to get it right now
have yet to try pvp, but one thing that bothers me is there, i don't think there's any targettable spells that you can place on the ground, target aoes
or persistent spells
which imo really sucks pvp wise and pve wise
well actually nah paladins have a concentration ability.
some aoe sigil thing.
and it's bugging me quite a bit that I can't constantly queue for pvp inbetween questing or etc.
so...........
but even then
I still much preferred the much faster dps
duels used to go by 5x faster
so the dmg nerf kind hampers the game actually enjoyability wise
kind of hampers*
so it's a bit bizarre they did such a big nerf
for the sake of pvp
and they nerfed before even trialing pvp with it
whats the term, triggerready/
and also lvling is going to be less enjoyable now, more traditional to an mmo, and..... well.... ppl have had enough of their mmo grinding
so...putting that time into a new mmo, that .... might not even be fun for pvp and pvp you cant even experience until lvl 30, if you can manage to get into a queue (haven't yet)
it's just too much of a potential time/pitfall unfortunately right now
(the nerf wasn't really noticeable until I hit mid 30s, and the questing went from say... complete a quest in 2-5 minutes, to ...taking 15-20 minutes)
that's a pretty big damper considering, more of the same boring questing from other mmos.
(and questing that is more updated like in GW2)
(public quest type etc.) nothing like that, and little to nothing to break up the monetony of the longer time to quest since there is no pvp
or world type bosses etc.
So Bless kind of really fucked over whatever player base they had, by introducing such a huge nerf
for the sake of pvp/seeing what the game would of been like on pvp / battlegrounds without the nerf
sooooo I would say the game would be less enjoyable than it was ..in the first 5 days
which is saying a lot.... and the nerf wasn't even something really asked for from the community
(besides minor nerfs for say ""op mages"" and such) but it was ~60-80% damage nerf all around
and yes rotations do do more dmg to make up for it, but you're still spending 5-6x the amount of time killing the same mob than before
(queue the 2-3ish minute quest to 10-20~ish time)
and regeneration rates weren't increased either
so..you're still spending that same time out of combat
(hp was increased, but mana wasn't increased or mana expenditure)
(for mages anyways)
so... the game went from being a 6, to a 4 now lo
l
and watching the dungeons .... that ppl are doing on twitch / end game ones
sure the models are cool
and refreshingish
buttttttt
the mechanics aren't anything special, new, or innovative, and because the nerfs, the fights are just more drawn out
and the most fued up thing about the rotations
is that...most rotations don't even do anything unique ability wise
say A-1-2-3 , versus B-1-2-3, Versus C-1-2-3
there isn't anything interesting like... B 3 doesn't apply a buff/debuff to a target that would say make A-2 do more dmg etc.
so the rotation encouragement is just a bunch of bs for the most aprt
part
PVP wise that's shitty as hell
since it'll mean I'll still only repeat the same few spells, and just use only a few different utility spells; like in Gw2 with their utility spells
then there's the no rolling aspect, and more stationary casting versus modern games
so....... yeah the damage nerf...actually helped show the shittiness/lack of depth of their combat systme
system*
the only thing that encourages/forces me to use other spells/abilities
is the fact that the one si just used are on cooldown.
but they're inferior ones, that do 25-50% less dmg than the rotation i did in SAy C-1-2-3, <cooldown> so im forced to do B-1-2-3
at that point i'd rather just be freaking auto attacking
since the B-1-2-3 doesn't serve any dynamic purpose, no dots, no dmg buffs,debuffs, etc.
that would say, increase the dmg of C-1-2-3 or even A-1-2-3 to encourage me to follow through with a different chain
(granted I don't really have much fun in GW2, not after I've already experienced the content repeating it wise, but it wouldn't feel as punishing as it would in this game, since there's a lot more variety to even level up with)
This game will need a pretty decent overhaul / more development to be any actual contender in the mmo field. (granted I didn't recall BDO having any arenas/battleground queues or etc. to queue for lvling as well, )
(and bdo didn't have different leveling paths either)
I'd rather stick to FFXIV for dungeons, WoW for Questing, Warhammer for PVP, and GW2 for Story.
This game doesn't do any of those better to take that ranking away from any of those for a replacement.
I guess this game excels in the Pets/Mount collection aspect.
That's literally the only thing that's particularly interesting/makes me want to go out and do other junk. <since dungeons/dmg were nerfed, dungeons just feel like a waste of time>

Wie fast alle Spiele hat auch Bless die ersten Tage massive Probleme beim Launch gehabt. Dies ist nichts neues und viele anderen Publisher mit anderen Games hatten dieselben Probleme (sogar viel schlimmere - Bless hat sich gut geschlagen!) trotz mehr ressourcen bei besagten.

Die Kommunikation des Publishers + Entwicklers (in diesem Fall 2in1) ist sehr gut. Meist gibt es auf groß auftretende Probleme innerhalb von 24 - 48 Stunden eine Antwort. Es gab sogar eine Entschädigung von knapp 25€ in Cashshop Währung für die Startschwierigkeiten - was bei EA Games eine Rarität ist und geschätzt werden sollte.

Firstly, at its core, without all the gamebreaking bugs, poor optimization, or any of the other countless problems Bless Online has; it really is a good MMO. Bless Online isn't some ground breaking game with new features never before seen, the game is years old already.

Plain and simple, the publisher who has brought this game to us, has done an incredible job showing just how much they want to get Bless Online right. Before the release, Neowiz assured us that the game would not be pay to win. Sure enough, there is'nt any pay to win. Day one, there are log in problems and other issues that prevent players from logging in. Neowiz fixed the problem the next day. A duping bug was found, and not even a day later the problem is resolved. Of the many emergency maintenances, all but one were completed on or before the time stated. 

I think that this game gets so much hate simply because the Bless Online we have is not the Bless Online that exists in the JP build of the game. However, it was clearly stated that the Bless Online we recieve will be different. While this game has many problems that can't be forgiven, Neowiz has shown again and again that they are listening to us, and that they will fix issues in a timely manner. 

Let's not forget that Bless Online is in early access. I don't mean to say that early access is a reason to forgive problems, becuase is most certainly is not. However, I think a lot of us have forgotten that Bless Online is a work in progress despite how long it has been around in other regions. Give Bless Online a few weeks to sort out the unforgivable issues it has right now(there really are too many to list-litterally every other review will have a list, go take a look xd), and I think we will have a solid MMO. 

But, if you like the MMO genre, and are willing to put up with the many problems that early access can bring, come along for the ride. Otherwise, come back in a few weeks and I think that most of the big problems will be addressed. Bless Online has been taking up just about all of my free time since its release. It has its problems, a lot of them, but I have been having a blast with it. Whether you buy the game now or later, anyone who likes MMO's and has a bit of patience will find joy in Bless Online.",True,1527856081,1527856081,True,0,0,0.000000,True

0,57,1,5578,5578,76561198122050285,0,english,False,42424004,"Bless Online has had a strange journey. It's travelled the world over and it's been met with failure at every turn; and then it was released in the West (America and Europe). If you've viewed any forums related to the game, you'll no doubt have seen the negativity surrounding its launch, some of which is completely justified and I share the frustration. However, there is huge amounts of toxicity surrounding both the game and the MMORPG genre at present, fuelled primarily by the over-hype people felt prior to launch. 
I'll get the negatives out the way first, since Bless is far from a perfect game in its current state. 
1. The optimisation is pants. This is pretty common in games running on UE3, in fact, I've yet to see a game run not run badly on it, but compared to the other games on the same engine (TERA, Blade & Soul, MU Legend) it runs pretty much as well as you'd expect. There are also some easy fixes savvy people have found by editting the .ini files to make a smoother experience. It's not ideal, but some fixes are easily done.
2. Issues with servers. These issues have been alleviated after the initial influx of players, but Neowiz went from 1 EU server to (I think) 7, locking character creation on the fuller ones along the way. This led to people being seperated from their friends and unable to play alongside them, and also leaves the problem further down the line of what to do when all these servers need to be remerged.
3. The combat. In some ways I enjoy chain based the combat so this is a good and bad. On the DPS classes it feels pretty meaty and quite nice. On Paladin I don't think it works all that well with healing. A major problem I encounter however is that there seems to be little to no balancing between skills within a classes own skills and stances, let alone those of others. There needs to be some major, major rebalancing of skills, as it stands there is an optimal skill or chain for each class, rendering the rest pretty much pointless.
4. End-game content is lacking. Sure, it's early access, but there's merely more of what you were already doing at end-game. From what I've seen the gear progression looks like it could be pretty asinine as well.
5. Typical quest based levelling. It's not the worst I've ever seen, but it sure ain't interesting.

Now, onto what I like about the game
1. Faction based PvP. I like me some factions, and after about level 30 you'll be running in to a LOT of the other faction. Pretty constant fighting if you're looking for it, but multiple channels if you're looking to avoid it.
2. No ""P2W"" in the cash shop. People's idea of P2W will differ, but as far as I can tell Bless has the least offensive cash shop of any B2P game.
3. Pet taming. While I'm not quite sure of the end-game benefits of it, I've got myself a hamster. I also tamed a full sized Succubus ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) and have a literal demon as a mount. It's fun, and if expanded could perhaps be a proper mini-game in and of itself.
4. Devs are bloody quick. Yes, yes I know ""The game's been out for 7 years."" It hasn't, that's a load of rubbish. Most of the major issues people have had been rectified by Neowiz, and we're only a few days in. They've fixed several (sometimes gamebreaking) bugs and exploits, they're compensating players for downtime, and just generally have been much better at communicating than most other Publishers out there. On the topic, Neowiz are both the Developers and Publishers, which in my mind is only beneficial, particularly because they really need to see success if they're to make their huge budget back.

This isn't ""early access"". Calling it that is a cop out. Going to change the recommendation until they get shit sorted.

TL;DR : It's nothing new save the environment and way you go about everything. Don't expect any groundbreaking advancements on the mmorpg genre as a whole. Should you buy it? I'm not your dad. Make your own decisions.

This game is the middle ground of mmos from a mechanics standpoint. It is nothing new but it at least does the same stuff in a passable fashion. If I had to sum up the actual issues with this game in three words, I would have to go with: developers, community, optimization.

The developers of this game attempted to slap an Early Access tag on a game that has been out for years and given the technical issues with the game, it becomes clear this was done due to them not putting the work in to put the game together properly. There was no testing done before a two day head start that had to be bought into was launched that ultimately saw many players not even able to play during that ""head start"" period due to server issues. Many of those that were able to play had to accept said head start being wasted due to the server their friends were playing on being locked to character creation. I can only assume that this was done to hide the fact that the game wasn't anything special before launch.

Another issue with the developers comes from their handling of the pve community asking for pve servers. They were denied their request, with the reasoning being that pvp is an integral part of the game. The only issue is that there exists an item ingame that allows you to turn off pvp for 10 minutes that can be purchased with ingame currency. This item does not function at max level, however, and you will be forced to use real money in order to purchase this item. If it were that integral to the game then they would not have a possibility for it in the game.

The issues with the community comes in the form of smug self-fellating douchecanoes who want to insist that any issues someone might have with the game stems from them being ""a wow-playing millennial who wants everything handed to them and is unwilling to work for anything ingame"". For the record, this game is not challenging. Any criticism of the game is met with hostility and whining nerds calling you ""toxic"" because they have their feelings wrapped up in this game.

Finally, to the issue of optimization... the game features constant FPS drops, frequent disconnections from the server, and a pants-shittingly retarded way of handling default settings.

For example GW2: had a 3 days headstart. The game was offline for hours in the first WEEK. The optimization was horrendous! Login servers were a mess! The lag was unstoppable..

What I'm trying to say is that MMO launches always suck and the EU/NA launch of Bless went better than any other MMO launch I've experienced. Quit the whining people. Don't jump on the bandwagon. Don't be a sheep. Don't copy other's behaviour.

Steam refunds are popular since around 2015 and people are spoiled. People are expecting things they really shouldn't expect. This isn't a AAA company with millions on the bank and people are forgetting this cos they're spoiled by companies like Activision Blizzard that rule the market right now, but were also ""bad"" at launching games in the beginning.

I love it so far. Only at level 27 right now and I love the leveling. The game reminds me of TERA (UE3), FFXIV and GW2. It's just a classic MMO. Nothing new. End game will be scarce, but it'll come eventually.",True,1527854876,1527854876,True,0,0,0.000000,True
0,151,3,2852,2852,76561198081044299,0,english,False,42423750,"So this one is hard to review because of the many factors and points of view you need to consider. I don't review it in a ""how did the launch go""-way, but more in a ""what is the game itself""-way.

This game is obviously in Early Access, but at the same time, it isn't: It's been released a few times already and old, known bugs are still in the game like the dupe-bug (which should be fixed by now). I'm well aware that this isn't ""the same version"", but if things like that are known, they still should get looked into before the game releases.

Graphics: 8/10
Nothing new, nothing old. It's just what you'd expect from a game that's running on UE.

Atmosphere: 7/10
While the villages and cities are build very nicely in a medieval-way, those are the places you only spend like 10% of your playtime. Areas at level 20 and above do have some elements that make it look filled up, but there still are some places that just feel plain empty. The starter area for Hieron, humans, is one of that, it's really just gras with some hills. Here and there a tree. The starting zone REALLY looks damn empty. If they would have put more work into some of the areas, I'd go with a 8/10 or even 9/10.

Sound: 6/10
Especially voices. Thats one point I usually don't really care about, but in this game I need to. The voices of your character, the NPCs, dialogues.. everything sound like it's recorded with a very, VERY cheap microphone. The music in general is okay, so this one saves that a bit. 2/10 for voices, 9/10 for music.

Performance: 4/10
I'm aware that there are several fixes out there, and I already did them. But it's a shame that there are fixes THAT SIMPLE and you need to do that by yourself in a game that you literally just paid for.
In my case: GTX 1080Ti, i5 8600k, 16GB RAM - without the fix the game was stuttering around at 20-40FPS, after i did the .ini fix it increased up to 120FPS, which is okay. But since I'd like to only rate the performance the game gives you by itself, I can't give a good rating there. Might be an UE problem though.

Combat: 6/10
I don't want to say too much here since there are (pretty sure) still balance updates coming, but in general, the combat feels.. normal. Nothing new. I like the normal skill system more (which is non-combo), but that's not important for this review. The combo system here feels kinda slow, some combos just feel way too weak to even use them, buffs/debuffs have such a short uptime that it's in some cases not even worth it to use them.
Since I've played Guardian, I can mostly speak for this class, and there it really feels.. meh. Taunting feels weird, sometimes I feel i can't get the aggro properly, I don't feel ""tanky"" at all even though Guardian is supposed to be the tanking class in this game. But still, there are probably balance patches coming out sooner or later, so I'll wait this one out.

Gameplay: 7/10
Endgame is missing sadly. So, pretty much, as soon as you hit Level 45, you can turn off the game and play something else until the endgame gets patched in.
Other than that, for the previous levels: nothing new, you get a quest, go to A, kill B, go back to the NPC, get the rewards, accept the next quest, repeat. The first dungeons felt kinda rewarding for completing them, but as soon as I hit the level 31 dungeon, there was just no reason to keep finishing the dungeon over and over again. You gain little to no EXP,  there are almost no geardrops and after the dungeon is complete, you need to wait 5 whole minutes to enter again. So this means: back to your NPCs, accept quests and do them.

Developers: 8/10
While being quite silent at the beginning, they quickly started to be transparent, they're updating the community on what they're doing, they warn you before shutting down the servers for maintenance. They even gave out a compensation for the server issues during the headstart period. Nothing really to complain here besides their silence at the beginning.

That's pretty much everything I can say about this game at this point.
Even though this game has some issues here and there, I'd STILL recommend it. If you got the money to spare, buy it and give it a try, you can still refund. The game has improved in the last few days, and I'm sure it will keep going that way in the next few weeks.",True,1527854857,1527854857,True,1,1,0.503968,True

[b]Oyun ne vaad ediyor ne vaad etmiyor:[/b]

1- Oyun klasik türde bir mmorpg yani standart sınıflar,parti sistemi,dövüş sistemi sunuyor.BDO gibi Hack&Slash dövüş sistemi, farklı sınıflar seviyorsanız size göre değil.
2- Oyunun %30'u PVE %70'i PVP üzerine kurulu. PVE seven oyuncuysanız bulaşmayın.
3- PVE olarak görevler,standart craft sistemi ve 600 civarı pet ve binek yakalama sistemi,Dünya Boss'ları, Normal,Elite,Hard zorluk seviyesinde şimdilik 6 zindan sunuyor ve burasından emin değilim 20 kişilik Raid varmış. (Parti sisteminden bahsetmiyorum)
4- PVP olarak 35Lv+ dan sonra açık dünya pvp,kale savaşları,klan savaşları, harita domine etme,bir çok pvp harita gibi içerikler sunuyor.
5- PVP'den kaçınmak mümkün 44Lv'e kadar oyun içi parayla 45Lv.den sonra Lumena ile alabileceğiniz bir item'le PVP'den kaçınabiliyorsunuz ama sürekli kaçınarak sadece PVE içerik için bu oyun oynanmaz.GW2,POE,Warframe gibi oyunlara yönelin.

[b]Fiyat:[/b]
Oyunun fiyatı maalesef 2,6 kurdan çevrildiği için bize bir miktar pahallı gelebilir.Ancak,bazı sitelerden 58TL'ye ana paketi almanız mümkün.Bu pakette sadece 1 aylık Premium yok. (01.06.2018) 

[b]Sistem:[/b]
Bu en önemli kısım.Oyun UE3 grafik motoru ve DX9 kullanmasına rağmen GTX1060 ekran kartı öneriyor ve bu ekran kartı şu an ülkemizde 1800TL.civarı. Kaldı ki GTX970 ve GTX1060'da dahi yer yer kasabiliyor.Optimizasyon hala sıkıntılı bana kalırsa oyunun en leş tarafı burası.Yani sisteminiz iyi değilse pek bulaşmanızı tavsiye etmiyorum.

[b]Kimler Oynamalı:[/b]
-Sistemi yetenler
-Eski usül PVP arayanlar
-Hali hazırda ki MMO'lardan sıkılanlar

[b]Uzun Lafın Kısası:[/b]
Oyun yenilikçi bir oyun değil,farklı şeyler vaad etmiyor.Bir oyuna benzetmek gerekirse ROI'ye benzeyen bir tarafı var.Olumlu oy versemde aslında arada gidip geliyorum.

- Performance nich so super
- Serverlocks
- Fehlender Content
- Quest Tracker Bug

Aber, liebe Leute - was andere hier bemängeln kann ich so überhaupt nicht bestätigen - Neowiz und ihr Umgang mit der Community. In dieser Frequenz, in der Neowiz versucht (und auch schafft) Probleme zu lösen und auf die Community eingeht, habe ich in der Art selten erlebt.

Es gibt Produzentenbriefe mit Stellungnahmen zur aktuellen Problematik wie dem fehlenden End Game Content, was ich, wie im Brief erklärt, aber auch vor SoftLaunch schon gelesen habe. 

Und bitte, bitte hört nicht auf jeden YouTuber, die aktuell Hetze gegen das Game betreiben. Teilweise sind dort auch Probleme benannt, die einfach garnicht stimmen (z.B. man müsse ewig Dungeons Grinden um zu leveln, da es keinen anderen Content gibt - Stimmt nicht!) ... Die Hexenjagd ist völlig unangebracht. Ja der Start war schwierig aber Neowiz bemüht sich offensichtlich, alles wieder ins Lot zu bringen - erste Content Updates kommen!

Und vergessen wir auch einfach mal nicht, dass das Game ""Early Access"" ist - wie bei jedem anderen Game auch können Bugs auftreten und es kann Content fehlen. 

Das Spiel ist bisher von den Mechaniken solide - ob es sich etabliert, werden die nächsten 4 - 12 Wochen zeigen und was Neowiz mit dem Game noch anstellt.

Archeage has a greedy dev team that has time and time again betrayed the playerbase and shat on them while claiming to care. Once Bless provides housing, I am curious to see how it goes and how many flock there.

Over priced black dessert emulator which aims to give you the feel on BDO but ends up making you feel miserable as you stare at the prairie gerbils prancing about you as you try to figure out why there is a frame rate drop everytime you access the UI.

The combat system is simply GREAT. If death comes bounding at you you can say ""okay.. today"" because through the frame rate drop and the choppy animations, death is a dear friend.

Go waste money on Black Dessert Online because this is as close as a game gets to BITCONNNECCCCT.. ahem let me rephrase that, i mean it feels like the game devs haven't finished jack shit and optimization? WTF is optimization? i wonder if the game devs have even heard of optimization.
Through all this shit talk and rage i can't help but feel like i was taken for a ride when i bought this game. Then again, i'm at fault for falling for this shitfest.

[list]
    [*]An excellent storyline that is well written and interesting. Questing is fun!
    [*]Very good voice acting, nearly every NPC has fully voice acted dialogue
    [*]Highly customizable combat system that allows you to chain skills together.
    [*]A development team that seems dedicated to listening to player feedback.
    [*]Unique classes with the right amount of diversity between them.
[/list]

Of course it is important to remember that the game is still in an early access period and you will need to be patient as the kinks are being ironed out. There are some optimization issues (easily worked around) that I am sure the devs will fix and improve upon as time goes by. I cannot stress enough how dedicated the staff seems to be in implementing new aspects of the game and making changes based on player feedback in a timely fashion. If you're looking for a 100% complete game, you should probably look elsewhere as Bless is indeed still in an early access period.

The game isn't 100% localised yet - this is in progress however as part of EA.
It also has it's share of bug and balance issues.
The optimisation is rather shoddy - until you look up some user sourced fixes, after which it runs really well for me.

There is missing content - 3 classes are to be added later down the line, the upodated combat hasnt been fully implemented for all classes and End game raids and some of the promised PvP modes are not in yet - A 15 v 15 BG is being added today though.

There's a whole Meme-train going on right now with people screaming about refunds, idiots like TheLazypeon pouring fuel on the fire of hysteria for youtube hits hasn't helped.

The launch was a bit of a shit show to be fair, for which the devs have been quick to apologise and provide in game compensation. 

Despite all of this, im having fun. The setting, the gameplay, combat, crafting are all interesting and have potential.

Every launch has issues but at the moment it keeps me wanting to play more.  I have only played around 10 hours of this game as of writing this review and will update it after reaching endgame to see what everyone is complaining about.  I have two characters atm, a paladin and a beserker.  I will write down all the issues other people have brought up and I will give my opinions on all of them.


Missing Combat System:
So I played beserker so I could test out the only working Action Combat System in the game currently.  Basically all it is, is a easier way of locking onto enemies then having to click tab all the time.  When I played this character after hearing so many people complain and complain that its ""A different game.""  I realized how bs they were.  Yea its one less button to press when battling.  In a game where you have to press a series of buttons in order to kill things, Wooo.   Its fine to wait for the devs to release all the other systems its not that big of a deal.

Performance:
Yikes yea this is an issue.  I highly recommend playing on the lowest settings with ini changes (look on the subreddit for the ini fixes),  I get 140-100 FPS while playing but around 10-30 FPS when loading new areas or during random lag spikes.  The game is playable unlike what people have said but the 10 FPS does get annoying.  They did improve FPS somewhat and they said they will continue improving it.  If you have a under performing computer I would highly recommend staying away from this for now.

Translation:
Its bad, but you are buying a early access game.  Its like buying DayZ and complaining the game isn't finished.


No Endgame Content:
I'm honestly not a big fan of 15v15 battles if they are anything like WoW battlegrounds.  Really boring and not my thing.  If they are like GW2 then hell yea I want that.  They announced they will be adding it in soon, in like 2 weeks.  Plus they already ADVERTISED they will be adding more content in every 3 months.  Archeage even if it was P2W garbage did add big content updates that kept the game alive, and im hoping Bless will do that as well.

Cashshop:
Like BDO but without stupid pets that make grinding faster and other BS.  Basically NOT P2W.  Will it be P2W later?  YES it probably will, if this game becomes P2W I will instantly change my review to a negative.



My thoughts:
I'm sad to see this game get all this hate and bad reviews.  Is it deserved?  Yes it is, they promised a lot of and confused their audience.  Unlike me a lot of people were thinking this was some sort of big new MMO that would shake the MMO scene and be a WoW killler.  I never once thought that, I just wanted a game like TERA or BDO that was fun to play and I wanted the be there from the start.  I'm tired of P2W garbage like ArcheAge and I don't want to pay subscriptions as I do not have the money for that.  This game does not seem like a cash grab, the founder packs are actually surprisingly a good deal.  Since this isnt a subscription based game its going to need microtransactions.  If they become P2W or REALLY important to get then I will instantly change my review.  Its the reason I stopped playing BDO and Archeage.",False,1527852922,1527853066,True,0,0,0.000000,True

I enjoy the game and its Features and i can understand that a lot of people are angry about these issues but im happy at least with the game. There is still a lot to do but i can enjoy the game at least and thats the important thing :).

Negative:
Performance issues, Needs a little bit of balancing the classes.

I personally had no expectations to this game whatsoever, i didnt play the japanese version nor did i follow the development or anything the developers supposedly promised.

That being said  i actually like the game so far, i barely meet the minimum requirements and its playable and my fps are good, so far i had very little stuttering in a few areas but i dont know how it will be with  a huge number of players around in pvp. I also haven't encountered any bugs up until lvl 26 where im writing this review.
The combat system is nice but a little bit repetetive, so far i use only 2 combos the whole time and dont even switch stances because there is no reason to.


What i dont like is that i cant trade with my friends, the system is similiar to BDO you have to get everything from the auction house and i also dont like that there is no cross server playing while servers and/or factions are getting locked on a too high population , this means that i cant play with all of my friends since one plays on a different server, which i cant even create a character on.
I also dont like that the 2 low level dungeons i did so far are too easy, you can solo them and  i wish they were difficult enough that you would need a full group to clear them but ive been told this changes at a higher level.

If you've watched a youtube video or a livestream and you think the combat feels slow or sluggish, you're right, it does look like it, but after I bought the game and gave it a shot the combat is actually pretty fun, looks slow but it's not imo.
The devs have also showed quick acting on game breaking bugs like loading screen or duplicating items, they also gave out compensation to those who tried playing 2 days early which imo is a big deal considering a lot of companies don't even acknowledge the issues their games might have, but neowiz did and offered compensation and refunds to anyone who felt cheated.

If the combat is the main deal breaker for you, buy the game and try it out. You have 2 hours of game time to refund and that is plenty to test out some basic combat.

I personally enjoy the game enough to have bought the founder's pack and will recommend it to my friends.

IMPORTANT

Ce tuto modifie un des fichiers .ini du jeu, pensez à en faire une sauvegarde avant toute modification, ceci peut ne pas marcher comme fonctionner parfaitement.

Maintenant que vous êtes prévenu, on va commencer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On va commencer avec le FOV

Comme certains le savent, la position de la caméra et le FOV sont clairement pas géniaux actuellement, trop haute / trop proche ce qui donne clairement un soucis au niveau du gameplay.

Du coup un petit tuto pour modifier le FOV du jeu, chose que j'ai faite depuis hier et je n'ai eu aucun soucis jusqu'à présent.
Voici donc la marche à suivre :

Allez dans votre répertoire d'installation du jeu (de base C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bless Online )

Allez ensuite dans le dossier Engine puis Config.
Une fois dans ce dossier ouvrez le fichier BaseEngine.ini avec bloc-note ou Notepad++.
Faites Ctrl+F pour ouvrir la recherche et tapez AspectRatioAxis.

Une fois la ligne trouvée, modifiez juste le X par un Y, ce qui devrait donner :

[Engine.LocalPlayer]
AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainYFOV

Sauvegardez le fichier avec Ctrl+S, fermez la fenêtre puis lancez le jeu.

Tadam, c'est mieux non ? :)
----------------------------------

Maintenant, passons au FPS fix.

Allez dans le répertoire du jeu (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Bless Online)

Allez ensuite dans le dossier Engine puis Config.
Une fois dans ce dossier ouvrez le fichier BaseEngine.ini avec bloc-note ou Notepad++.

Faites Ctrl+F pour ouvrir la recherche et tapez bSmooth.
Remplacez la valeur TRUE par FALSE, ce qui donne ""bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE""

----------------------------------------

Faites Ctrl+F encore une fois et tapez PoolSize.
Recherchez la ligne PoolSize=XXX (XXX=des chiffres, pour moi c'était 160)
Remplacez la valeur affichée par la correspondance de votre carte graphique :
512MB = 512
1GB : 1024
2GB : 2048
4GB : 4096

Actuellement, le jeu ne supporte pas plus de 4096MB

Ce qui devrait donner ""PoolSize=4096"" (4096 car ma carte à 4Gb de mémoire).

----------------------------------------

C'est pas finit !

Maintenant regardez la ligne juste en dessous ""MemoryMargin=20""
Remplacez 20 par 256

----------------------------------------

Ouvrez la recherche une nouvelle fois avec Ctrl+F et tapez ""ThreadedShader""
Cherchez la ligne ""ThreadedShaderCompileThreshold=1""
Remplacez la valeur ""1"" par le nombre de coeurs physiques de votre processeur, pour ma part j'ai un i5-4670k donc 4 coeurs physiques, donc ma valeur est de ""4""

----------------------------------------

Sauvegardez puis fermez le fichier.

[i]Bless is in a very interesting position. To my memory - this is the first MMO that community tries to kill, instead of game being killed by developer or publisher, like it happens with most other MMOs.[/i]

[h1]Let's start with negatives: [/h1]
[list]
[*]Translation could be better. Especially where skills are concerned. However it's one of those issues that can be fixed easily and fast and really not a big deal if you're playing the game at a normal pace.
[*]Optimization is pretty bad out of the box. It gets a lot better with certain tinkering in .ini files and your GPU driver control panel though. After some tinkering you'll get stable good peformance, I get 100+ fps in dungeons and 40+fps in very populated cities with GTX 970. If you're a PC gamer and don't know how to adjust your settings that's your own fault really, PC is not a console.
[*]Endgame PvP balance is meh. They're actively working on it though. 
[/list]
[h1]Moving on to UNDESERVED ""negatives"":[/h1]
[list]
[*]Launch experience is/was a lot better than a lot of people paint it out to be. At least in EU. The amount of time I have not been able to play the game due to maintenance in first 4 days sums up to around an hour and a half. (evening play sessions after work). This is the first time in my experience where additional servers got added almost instantly, closing registration/allowing it once again decisions were made promptly and the overall server performance was great except evening of 2nd day before server restart (physis btw). I've lived through a lot of MMO launches (LA2, WOW, Rift, GW, GW2, Wildstar, ESO, Archeage, BDO and many others) and this launch was decent. Don't even make me remember shit ESO pulled off with their ""hey guys, EU servers will be located in NA until later this year BTW"".
[*]""No endgame content"" - Is just a pure lie. Yes, loot chances of highest tier gear in endgame dungeons are low. Gear still drops though, contrary to what a lot of people will make you believe. It's june 1st, less than a week since the pre-order start and they've already implemented the first battleground. Not to mention the glorious openworld RvR fights near dungeon entrances. There's plenty content, at least for now. 
[*]""Duping exploit"" - stuff like this existed in EVERY eastern MMO upon it's launch in our region. We went through it with Tera, went through it with AA, went through it with BDO (well, BDO actually had plenty of game-breaking exploits not just on launch day but even months later, but that's a whole another matter). What's important is that issue has been quickly adressed, official stance on it was released, punishments were explained. 
[*]""Dated Graphics"" are fine. Game isn't the most beautiful, but it's not ugly either. I can't criticize graphics.
[/list]
[h1]Positives :[/h1]
[list]
[*]There is NOTHING. And I mean NOTHING that can be considered ""pay to win"" in the cash-shop. Even the experience boost that is in the cash shop is so minor that having in-game pet with ""xp"" roll nets you 4x better bonus. 
[*]Vocal developer/publishing team that actually communicates with community. I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH how important this is and what an impressive job they've done so far. A lot of the most annoying issues (like launch splash screen that they couldn't realistically test in dev environment because it was steam vs bless authentication issue) were solved in the first couple days. All of the major complaints get adressed in official news posts. Even if the game have released unfinished (which Early Access model suggests btw) - they're really doing a good job at fixing it and speaking with community. Battleground release in the first week of EA is something I didn't even expect, yet they're doing it. Server maintenance time were short (at  least during ""normal"" playing hours in EU region) and in-game server performance was top notch. Not to mention that they've still compensated all founders, and straight away claimed in developer letter that they will accept any refunds from people who didn't understand that they're buying into early access. Huge props for this.
[*]Combat in the game is probably one of the best adaptations of the ""old classic mmo tab target"". Somewhere around GW2. It starts off pretty weak, but at later levels combat system blossoms and even though it's still not ""action combat"" it's still satisfying, fun, impactful, and situation-dependant in terms of what skills and stances you have to equip.
[*]Voice acting is pretty good. Quality of VO recording is not stellar, but voice acting itself is good. Well done there. 
[*]Questing is your typical MMO questing. No grinding though. Not good, not bad. 
[*]Crafting and taming systems are ""interesting enough"". Not overcomplicated, but still rewarding for people who want to do that and not high-level-gated. Meaning that if you want to stay level 15 and make tons of gold with crafting - you can. Taming is very interesting as well.
[*]This one was a big one for me - ALL and I mean ALL of RNG chances are stated in game. You don't have to google/spreadsheet stuff in order to find out what are your chances of success(enchancement/pet upgrading), what is the boost from failstacking and so on. All of the percentages are clearly stated in the game client, so you don't have to do any guess-work. 
[*]Music in the game is pretty good. 
[*]Party content that exists. Decent but not stellar dungeons.  Interesting party-buff system (can be based on races, classes, a lot of different factors, and party leader selects the buff that will benefit party the most. ""crafting parties"" from random pick up groups have became very popular very fast. So a lot of people are socializing and talking to each other while doing crafting to get some sweet boosts).
[*]World lore/story actually has something behind it. 
[/list]

[h1]Summing up, TL:DR : [/h1]

Bless is a Decent Asian MMO that is just good. It's not Great, it's not the savior of the genre, it's just a decent MMO and what makes it stand out is the effort developer tries to put into communicating with their playerbase and making them happy and the fact that there are no P2W elements (at the current stage). Game is in Early Access, so expect some bumps, and expect to make a few quick edits to game config (in less than 2 minutes) if you want it to run good. 
If you're a guy/gal who enjoys MMO and especially enjoys exploring NEW MMOs with the community, figuring stuff out, having that ""new world"" experience - bless is worth your 30 $. Also expect a lot of toxicity from overly vocal part of MMO community that have decided to crucify this game for no reason.",True,1527848248,1527851650,True,33,249,0.580021,True

What BLESS needs is major coding issuses and engine stabliity changes.

+ The character creation is one of the best I've worked with and wish other MMO's would use a similar system

============================================

- Nice Graphics even on UE3
- Combat is interesting, combo system and ""action combat"" where you aim with mouse
- Pokemon Style ""catch em all"" aspect, can catch over 650 pets/mounts, almsot any enemy can be tamed
- PVE content is fun so far even if the game is labeled as open PVP, there is enough of both it seems
- Faction vs. Faction Open PVP!!!  This is always fun & it has an item you can drink if you want to avoid it too
- Developers have been active in week 1 to stop a duping bug & give compensation for server problems
- Dungeons can be run solo or with small parties early one, not requiring a full party

- Missing endgame content that is in other versions of the game for PVE & PVP (will be added slowly throughout EA)
- Translation of skills needs work
- Servers have queue for now on the busiest ones
- Performance is poor for some high end machines(Low FPS & requires .INI file editing)
- Action combat is not all the way done, only 1 class has it working to start EA


Overall the game is really cool, the game play is fun, looks nice, combat is engaging, and the pokemon taming is also addicting for me. I think this game has a lot of potential and it will depend on what the developer do to improve performance + add content during Early Access. If they work fast enough to bring us players content every few months showing they are working diligently on this game, it will grow in players and will be a game we can play for a long time.

- Pour un jeu sorti pour la 4e fois (après plusieurs sorties ces dernières années dans différentes régions), il est loin d'être stable et équilibré. C'est un peu dur a avaler sachant l'expérience accumulé par les précédentes sorties. A 30€ minimum, un abonnement et un cash shop optionnel (une triplette assez rare tout de même) on est en droit d'attendre beaucoup plus. A voir sur la durée d'autant que le contenu semble limité. On pourrait excuser sur un ""vrai jeu early access"" mais pas sur un jeu déjà ancien.

- Pour le jeu lui-même, le gameplay est fun, l'histoire simpliste mais plutôt prenante. A voir sur la durée mais les bases sont intéressantes, surtout pour ceux qui aiment les jeux comme TERA, TESO et autres jeux a gameplay pseudo-dynamique.

- Graphiquement et au niveau des animation, ce n'est pas super mais tout de même propre. Les paysages sont paticulièrement bien réussis, tout comme les villes qui pour une fois dans un MMO ont du relief et une architecture imposante. Pour les personnage c'est propre, sans plus. On voit bien que le jeu n'est pas tout frais, après rien de franchement problématique.

Pour conclure, je dirai juste ""pourquoi pas"" à ceux qui hésites. Sachant que le refund est dispo, le risque est limité. A savoir bien sur que tout est anglais mais pour les doublages audio c'est tout a fait compréhensible même avec un niveau très moyen. Attention cependant, les bugs de lancements sont agassant tout comme les lags par moment. Le jeu n'est pas stable. Vous êtes prévenus! 

PS: pour ceux qui mettent ces défauts sur le compte du statut early access, soyons un peu réaliste: le jeu n'est pas un vrai EA pour la simple et bonne raison qu'il est déjà sortie plusieurs fois! on sent ici le bouclier anti-émeute dressé par le développeur au cas où les gens viendraient (à raison) se plaindre.",True,1527837681,1527899356,True,0,0,0.000000,True

J'le recommande quand même, car même pour un early c'est pas non plus un cauchemard.
Mine de rien, impossible d'avoir un jeu fluide même en mettant le jeu en Low. ( J'tourne BDO en ultra )
La techniques d'enchaînement des sorts est un peu caca, en combat il est impossible de se placer pour les aoe hors si tu recule 10 secondes avant. On a pas d'iframe, hors une mini roulade qui a 20 secondes de CD . Edit : Maintenantn otre roulade fonctione par charge. 6 Charge maximum et une fois avoir consommé les 6 roulades ya un cd avant d'en avoir une nouvelle.

Pour les donjons, celui niv 31 est un carnage.(  Ya deux factions, et quand vous vous baladez si vous avez pas la Peace Declaration, vous etre vulnérable et pouvez vous faire attaquer par des joeurs de la faction adverse. J'ai déjà vu des lvl 40 de la MÊME guilde attendre dans un petit chemin des lvl 27 pour les kill. ( Les peace declaration coûtent 5 argent, je ne sais plus ) mais dure que 10 minutes.. 
Le dj 31 se trouve dans une petite grotte, et quand tu sors du dj, tu spawn avant ta fin de chargement, donc tu peut te faire instakill en étant encore dans le chargement :-) 

Pas assez de variétés pour les mobs, que ce sois les Pet ou les Mount.

Pas assez de drop en donjons, en 3 boss tu as 1 gants et un short ?_?

Edit : J'ai rejoins une guilde. Le Farm des Hunt quest est indispensable et très rapide en groupe de 5 ! 

Bref, beaucoup à dire, mais en général, il est compliqué. La prise en main est compliqué, j'ai commencer archer, une fois 21 je me suis fait un berserk et j'ai pas du tout eu le même ressenti pendant le leveling. 
Quand t'es en groupe, les quêtes sont à moitiés liées, au final t'es en groupe mais tout le monde fait ses mobs soi même (j'parle pas des hunt quest).

Les potions faut les acheter soi même ou te les craft pcq t'es vite à court, tu dois réparer tes équipements au bout de 3 run de donjon, les montures ont pas assez d'endurance par rapport aux distances que tu dois parcourir..

Bless is new and trying new concepts where we (westerners) probably don't need them and keeping things the same that we...probably also don't need to have changed and comes out to be just plain fun. I wouldn't say it's great, or the best, or surprising, but like the pre-release reviewers concluded: it's just good.

 It had a rocky couple days start with an unforeseen huge early adopter population and server clogs, crashes, and mishaps, but they recovered extremely fast and 3 days in it's been great. I have been part of many MMO's launches that were just like this only didn't recover as quickly.

I wish they had doubled the number of servers before launch and added more without maintenance. I wish they had stress tested more aggressively and given founders a bigger headstart. I wish they had more UI, chat, item, and market features. I wish they had more hidden and random content tucked away in various corners of the world for us to explore. I wish it wasn't quite so...Early Access? But, the game is good and has a chance to be very entertaining for a very long time.

The graphics and art are a huge improvement over the many cartoon-like copy-cats out there as started in 2004 and though optimization is an obvious need, I've had 4 or 5 MMO's on this computer over the past few years and it runs as well as any of them, save Star Wars TOR (and it's launch got on track MUCH faster). The game is beautiful and I hope in the future they gear the content to make us stop and appreciate the beauty of the cities and world every step of the way. 

I think the buy in price for early access has irked a lot of people, but over the past 20 years I've paid a $10-15 monthly subscription half of those years for one MMO or another and I think a) it's usually worth it and b) I spend enough time on the game that I spend a lot less on other entertainment (this was true even when I was a broke teenager).  They've made the sub here VERY OPTIONAL so it's just a different pay model but we'll pay less on average than a hard subscription model and way less than a free to pay, with cash shop model (err. free-to-play).

The bottom line is, I'm having fun and the game is good, could be great. Dev team is moving quick and responsive, maybe even too responsive for their own good. I foresee a lot of fun times ahead.

Grafisch ist das Spiel im vergleich zu den am Markt erhältlichen MMO's absolut Top und eines der schönsten am Markt.

Das technische Gerüst ist ""veraltet"", das merkt man dem Game auch an.
ABER, zeigt mir ein MMO's das mehr als 200 Spieler auf max Settings mit über 80 fps darstellen kann!? (AUßERHALB DER STADT)- es gibt keines ;)

Das Game läuft betreffend der Performance - seit dem Server Neustart am 29.05. mittlerweile akzeptabel - für ein EA. Die Performance ist also für die darstellung der Anzahl an Spielern OK und liegt absolut im MMO Durchschnitt.

Manche Systeme haben aktuell Probleme mit fps Drops - dafüpr ist der EA gedacht, den vor allem Koreanische MMO's werden auf Highend Hardware meist nur bedingt angepasst, da in Korea der großteil der Spielerschaft in Internet Cafes zockt - es gibt also Durchaus Potenzial das man nutzen kann, um die Performance zu verbessern.

Das ""Tolle"" außerhalb der Stadt, wenn sich 200 Leute Prügeln läuft das Game - bei mir - ohne Lags/fps Drops und mit durchschnittlich 50-70 fps in max Settings, ich kenne kein MMO das das schafft bei einer Spieleranzahl 200+

Ja der Start war eine Challenge, ich musste das Game auch 3-4 mal Neustarten, um die Möglichkeit der Serverauswahl zu erhalten. Ja am Di dem 29.05 gab es über Stunden starke Lags, aber es wurde Zeitnah auf Twitter kommuniziert und generell habe und hatte ich solche Probleme auch bei anderen MMO's, ich habe mich also schon im Vorhinein darauf eingestellt.

Das Kampfsystem läuft bei mir absolut Rund - kann aber aktuell nur den Paladin und Mage beurteilen. Ja ich ""hoffe"" es kommt für alle Klassen das auf Youtube gezeigte Action Combat System - aber das aktuelle ist vorweg für mich in Ordnung und macht mir persönlich mehr Spaß als das in WOW - um ein Beispiel zu nennen.

Fazit:

Das Spiel läuft seit dem Server Neustart vom 29.05 bei mir durchaus fl+ssig - in der Stadt 30-40 fps und außerhalb im Regelfall 60-140 (ich habe nur das Fps Cap entfernt sonst an den ini's nichts Bearbeitet).
Das aktuelle Tab Targeting System geht Flüssig von der Hand und hat durchaus seinen Reiz.
Die Story empfinde ich als Standardkost, hat aber durchaus interessante Ansatzpunkte.

Ob das Game ""Erfolgreich"" wird, wird sich in den nächsten Wochen zeigen, wenn unter anderem der erste Contant Patch folgt (soll in 1-2 Wochen kommen).

you might think that was pointless and random but thats just one character. yes there are fps issues, im playing with a gtx 1060 6gb and lowest settings get me 25 frames in a big city and mid 50- low 60 other places. there were no disconnections, nothing that got me killed that wasnt my fault. this game has potential and ive heard how this is like the 4th time they tried or something but if the community would stop being toxic on the first days of the launch then maybe they would see that its worth working on. 

i bought the $30, it seemed like a big risk to me and i was ready on the refund option just because of the reviews. not even 30 minutes in and im hooked. i havent played an mmorpg like where its sole combat focus is skill balance and no auto attacks. i found myself a little group and we were talking about the game all day while going over what we could do once we hit end game since there is none. 

One is the taming. that alone should have enough content to keep anyone satisfied just trying to get that cool/saucy companion. Two was grinding out the life skills. Boring, i get it.

Upgraded servers to new high end models after first day.

Fixed the duplication bug of the AH.

Optimization of the game and adding in new content.

TLDR: 
- Performance issues can be fixed on your own
- To the 3 region failing - Learn Publishers (other regions) vs. Developers
- Lumena character lock is a glitch, being fixed.
- Barely any mmo makes marketplace items Account bound (a lot of ffxiv items are character bound)
- LazyPeon (and similar content creators) are a joke.
- No one made you pay 150$ for a 30$ game. Make better life choices.
- Premium is not required, not game breaking
- Real cash shop has 0 p2w. 20% EXP is nothing in this game when 147% exp boost is available to ALL
- Neowiz is very communicative. Problems will be fixed with time. Servers are stabilizing.
- Computer sucks, but able to run 40+ fps in major populated cities
- Love this game, I believe that hate train is exaggerated. Game has a lot to offer. For those waiting for the fixes before purchasing, you have a valid reason and that's fair. For those hate training, honestly, just stop being such an entitled, stereotypical gamer.


Having said that, I was rather surprised by the game, in a very pleasant way. The game is having some optimization performance issues, that is true. However, after some editing of the .ini file, it's extremely playable without sacrificing a lot of the graphics. I do not have a strong machine (garbage AMD processor, 970 GTX 4gb) and playing at 40+ fps in major cities while also having graphics up to 3-4 in-game settings.

The questing is generic, but what mmo doesn't have boring, generic questing? I even find GW2 leveling to be god awful. 

The combat rework is not as bad as people are claiming it to be. It did take some time to get used to, but really it's quite nice in my opinion. The largest thing to get used to is stance swapping OFTEN. That's what it is meant for. It's not meant to be played in only 1 stance majority of your time. I do recommend changing your key bindings though as the default can be rather jarring.

As for the people talking about the game failing in 3 regions - When you are dealing with a publisher, getting fixes to your game as a developer takes way too much time, especially across regions. There is a limit to how much they can do when having to push it through to a publisher. The current iteration in NA/EU is not even close to being P2W, not even the premium service. Here's an example: 20% exp potions would be a lot in most MMOs, however, in Bless Online players can obtain a companion pet that can give a maximum of 147% exp boost. All players have access to this level of boost. So in comparison, 20% is literally nothing. 

Players talking about how the game is not worth the 150$ they paid. The base game costs 30$, any price you paid after that is 100% on you and your life choices. Let's say you knew about the 3 region failing, you knew about the other reviews about how awful the game would be at launch (looking at you LazyPeon, joke of a content creator), why would you spend 150$ on a game you're already going to shitpost about anyways? No one is making you spend 150$. For the pack items being character bound and not account bound - yes that sucks, however, almost no one allows that these days. It's actually very uncommon for market items to be account bound in the current market. This sucks absolutely, but no one should be surprised at this point. The Lumena being character bound and not account bound has been addressed, it's a bug and WILL be fixed.

Speaking of bugs, Neowiz has been very communicative during the last couple days of launch and very fast to respond to the issues. They even compensated players during head start in a generous way I feel. (For those that played Archeage, we never got compensated, not many companies compensate for such problems and it's awful). Honestly, a lot of the loading issues are just launch day problems. I love how people find it acceptable of Blizzard to have launch issues, but a smaller company like Neowiz, it's forbidden to have any. 

Honestly, content creators like Lazy Peon find it far easier to make income by bombing game reviews that take only minutes to make to create a hate train hype to gain views (people love to hate on things). Seriously, all of his videos are first impressions (so literally plays maybe 10 hrs of a game to then give a review as if he understands everything it has to offer). 

Overall, I find the game to be rather promising. It'll take some time to fix the performance problems, but it will be done. Based so far on how Neowiz has handled the current issues, I don't doubt it will be taken care of in time.  I can find myself playing this game for quite some time.

I also work full-time, school full-time, and have a child so I won't burn through the content in a week. I mean it was $30 and now I can hop on whenever and play a non-P2W open world PVP game. I miss TERA's open world pvp when it first released and vanilla WoW's before that. This scratches that itch for me.

The world is actually kind of huge and each of the cities I've visited so far are within giant castles - even the small outposts. The wide, rolling hills kind of remind me of Oblivion in a weird way. The color scheme and everything else seems more realistic as well which I kind of enjoy - not flashy waving banners everywhere, neon colors only found on players who choose those hair colors etc. There is a sense of beauty in the simplicity in the world.

(So far) The armors and weapons I equip all cause my character to look different (BDO, cough) which was always a deal breaker for me. Gives me a sense of progression. The combat is fun too. It's tab target but it's different still. Tough to explain. You chain combos together and can stance dance sort of (but it changes your entire skill bar)...I guess would be the easiest to describe it. It just feels different enough from WoW etc. to be enjoyable and semi fresh.

Our culture is different.  I understand translation issues - that is not what bothers me.  Its things like:
- Unable to actually use the auction house... it isnt one, its a communist house where its fixed prices to resell...

Of all the MMOs I have ever played in my entire life, Bless Online is easily the BEST one of our time. The combat mechanic is very interesting in that it doesn't promote silly burst plays and revolves around players starting out with weak attacks before finishing off strong with their combos. The game is fairly balanced and the cash shop is not p2w as many may believe since you can just dupe your lumena to have infinite amounts. I also loved how the devs implemented the world pvp. There is no other game out there that lets you gank lowbies for many hours without any consequences. Also, I must add that this server start up in the early access has been the most smooth and pleasant experience ever. People are lying when they say they are constantly crashing or get sick of being placed in queue (just log in dummy lol). The game is fantastically optimized and I am running the game at a steady 144fps for my 144Hz monitor. I never lag despite the number of models and players that can fill up my screen.

Most notably things like optimization, translation, and balance. These are all things that can be fixed in time. There a lot of people who gave this game negative reviews on launch day which was admittedly rocky at best. Neowiz initally only had one server for Na, and one for EU. It was horrible, as the head start bonus was eaten away because of full servers, long queues, and bugs with the starting screen. This was fixed by the developer really quickly, but some people did not have any patience for it. In fact I distinctly remember one youtuber who told people to refund the game quickly over these issues, and they even mentioned the diary quest as a reason not to play. The diary quest was where they had an item in the world that spawned every 7-10 seconds, and people had to compete to collect it. This youtuber railed about how there was 200 people trying to get it, which was an obvious overexaggeration. I personally never saw more than 25 people waiting at it. Neowiz fixed this almost immediately by giving it a 1-3 second spawn rate. However this youtuber made a video after the fact saying it was still a problem, which was an outright lie. Many people tried correcting him, but he refused to listen to reason and even openly mocked them in his comment section. Keep in mind, this was just the first day. A lot of the negative complaints  were made on this day. I can say that much of the initial problems have been solved. The optimization problem can be solved by an easy edit of the .ini files that come with the game. The translation issues persist which sometimes creates problems, but most of us can understand what it's trying to say. I would say I reccomend the game in that it seems the developers are dedicated to getting things on track, and after a few days of playing I think it's worth the buy to play asking price. I decided to play the game as much as possible before I gave a review, unlike a lot of the negative comments that surfaced here on day one. If you take a close look, a lot of the negative comments are from the first day with minimal playtime hours.  Make no mistake there are issues with the game, but that is why the developers made it clear it was early access.

If you want a fun pvp mmo and enjoy the trinity style then this game is for you. Take the critcism this game is receiving with a grain of salt as most people that complain have either not played longer than a couple hours, are regurgitating what they heard from others, and just people that aren't using critical thinking. The game is fun, looks good(not great, but good), and is unique in many ways. Definitely worth my $40.",True,1527823513,1527823513,True,0,0,0.000000,True

The game while it had plenty of issues on launch day as is lacking in true end game content (for a few weeks) is in itself full of potential in terms of what could happen, partiularly in pvp. A large scale pvp game with a gear treadmill but one that is tiny compared to games like BDO but better than GW2 where you are pretty much all equal. It exists in the middle ground between these two approaches. There is no P2W in any real way, all I saw was a minor dungeon point/exp buff which is the cost of a subscription if you must have it, but with how relatively easy the treadmill is compared to some games it should not be an issue. 

I think two of the most enduring issues that will exist in this game will be graphical quality problems (which will never change) and optimization (which may get better over time). At the moment disregarding normal launch problems and anything related to that there are other issues such as class balance and pvp being pretty much who can land their one-shot-combo first with mages have a distinct lead over other classes. This will be getting changed but how well it goes remains to be seen. Action combat was disabled as well for many classes which of course will be readded but is still frustrating. Translations are an issue, most things can be figured out and for while normally it would be a small issue it is hard to imagine why they were unable to hire a translator/editor to fix it. Aparently the only correct stuff is done by the voice actors because they rewrote it as they went. 

The game in its current state is not worth its price tag, although I still believe it is worth playing, particularly if it was cheaper. If you have money to waste and just want to mess around in a new MMO give it a spin, if you need to count your dollars hold off until more is added in a few months.",True,1527822430,1527822430,True,0,1,0.000000,True

This might very well be the most souless, half cooked, pathetic attempt at making a game I have ever seen. Go play anything else but for the love of all things gaming DO NOT PLAY THIS!

Pros: Having the ability to NOT buy the game

Cons: 

-Souless copy and paste zones. This game looks like an asset flip not a game. 

-Worst in class music. (it seriously is 10-15 second tracks on loop.... did they even try?)

-No housing or castles to own. They expect us to fight for zone control and to be.....homeless? Weird. They claim that they will add housing, but the game has been out for years in other areas, and everyone is still without a home. 

-They opened only one server in the game for the first 30-45 minutes and all of the high end guilds were forced on that server. This split up  many members of guilds, and now that the server is back up for chracter creation, everyone will always flood one server (Tanara server). No way to solve this issue. All the others severs will be dead in a few weeks. GG

-horrible, ugly visials. A tree here and there, and endless miles of scorced earth everywhere else. There were better looking games 15 years ago. Nothing in this game looks even mildly interesting. 

-Slow moving characters designed to waste your time for no reason. 

-Slow combat annimations/combos

-Zero skill tab targeting PVP (most people die in 3-4 hits)

-Pet system without much of a point. (Slight buffs but nothing exceptional about it)

-Mounts have stamina that drains VERY fast for no reason what so ever. 

-Worst UI I have ever seen in a game

-Very weak and boring craft system with so few options, it makes you think they put it together in one afternoon.

-Quests could not be worse even if they tried. About as unispired as one could imagine.

-Zero and I mean ZERO endgame content. The level 45 dungeon does not even drop gear yet. So get to 45 and do.....what? 

People can try to white knight this one all they want, but it will be beyond dead in a 2-3 months top. Avoid if possible, but if you are so darn thirsty (and I know you are) buy it and remember my words: ""Your thirsty self is only drinking sand when you buy this game."" -Captain Toad

Optimize the game yourself for smooth performance via the basegame.ini file. (rather than complain like a lot of people already have)

turning off the 62 fps cap - bSmoothFrameRate=FALSE

- i really liked the fact you can tame pretty much anything

- graphics are not up to par with what i expected. yes, it's an older engine but the world just looked so bland and boring
- unoptimized. FPS was way below what it should be for the computer i had
- as a ""founder"", my rewards were locked to the first character i created. also, you can only create 4 characters per server. on top of that, i was forced into a faction
- content that was promised was not released (ie. end game). i was also getting drops for classes that they had said they would release at a later date
- everything felt too easy. you could solo the first two dungeons. you could autopath to every quest NPC/area. while this might be fine for a game like BDO where there is no flight path to anything, this game has multiple fast travel methods
- poor translation of skills, notifications ""You are now 11level"", ""Attack for 26 and make gain 1 rage""

2/28 mid day: Hyped
2/29 all day: Feeling like; OK maybe the ranger isn't as fun as the guardian.. Tried the guardian, OK maybe the mage is better..Tried the berserker.. OK none of these classes are any fun. 
2/30 updated damage tweaks meaning that you'll have to spend more time killing things with a pretty boring combat system. 
6/1 couldn't bring myself to play this game anymore.. 
6/3 launched the game and find myself at the plaza.. no a player in sight yet having to endure 12FPS. 
This game was such a dog and pony show. I’m upset I didn't buy assassin's creed origins on that weekend when it was 35.99. 
 I tried to give this game a chance but in hindsight I realize it was pretty dumb to ignore all the obvious signs. This game isn't better than: ESO, GW2, Archeage, BDO, ffxiv, tera, wildstar, dauntless, SWOR, Neverwinter, star trek online,.. Sh!t this game isn't even better than Tree of Saviour. this game belongs in the free-to-play bin along with riders of icarus, EOS, shroud of the avatar.. what a waste. On a positive note: this game actually pushed to figure out how to install dragon's dogma online with english patch and everything.. thanks bless online for filling me with such dissatisfaction that you actually made me be productive this weekend.


 -Pros
* Its an mmo. We love mmos for some reason. 

* Open world

* Pets and mounts are more attainable than most other mmos

* Great sound

 - Cons
* I know it’s early access but the performance on this game is bad. It’s mainly FPS drops. To this day it’s a mystery why or when the FPS drops are going to occur. I thought that after 4 days, an apology letter and 2-3 patches the FPS would stabilize but it didn't.

* Boring combat. I know this is subjective. For me the combat is a keyboard nightmare and the combo system failed to engage me. 

* Community. Here me out. I’m not blaming actual people here. The chat log is broken up into Help, Faction, and General (i think).. The help chat is endless and boring.

To sum it up I LOVE THIS GAME, i have been waiting for a new MMo for soooo long i honestly don't care that there are no OCE servers just to put that out there.

i have been consistently playing since day 1 (with and without queues as Australian afternoon is NA's downtime so im lucky) so i am actually going to review the GAME for its GAMEPLAY and not the launch like most people do. In saying that, this is NOT the worst launch i have seen (ArcheAge was 10x worst, and WoW expansions are also quite terrible besides Legion)

The game itself is very enjoyable, even coming from an Australian with 240ping. I am absolutley loving the combat system as i have played both mage and berserker and its honestly just enjoyable to run around and kill stuff whether its players or mobs. Sure, there isnt much content for end game but i honestly prefer it that way, always waiting and knowing that more content will be added is what keeps me going for MMO's if ALL the content was released straight off the bat, then what is there to look foward too? whats the point when people who no life the game will reach end game content in 2 weeks and then throw it away knowing nothing new will come out for a long time? at least this way we have new classes and new content WE KNOW are going to be implemented in the coming weks.

Now, it does go without saying there are issues, bugs and general stability drops but they have stated they will work on optimisation as we are going and in the past few days i have noticed BIG stability changes in the servers itself which tells me that neowiz are actually trying to make things better which gets my respect.

Im not one to complain, never have been. If i am in a queue (which i have waited in 1500-3000 queues so dont get me wrong) i will just do something else, i paid for this game like anyone else and i paid for founders too had the same connectivity issues as everyone else and ALSO with my top notch Australian internet didnt download that fast either. But hey, when i finally got to play i really enjoyed it.

So please, Do not be a sheep and just follow the negative reviews, give the game a chance. The game will get optimized, the bugs will get fixed and they already are ontop of the Item duping and are punishing for it so i have faith Neowiz will get on top of things, they just need time. Which i am willing to give.

* All features enabled or not have them visable.
* Low settings should run at least 30fps for a majority of users.
* Game should either be free with expensive non-essential skins or cost money and have cheap addons.

I work in Localisation myself and the quality of translations is not a major effect on the gameplay.

The game is fun with a good combat and the customer service team is very kind and detailed in their responses, this development team and publisher team really cares about their players and sets needed adjustments with a very fast turnaround, they frequently update their twitter since launch and also reward us for our patience which no other company always does.

A lot more content is coming soon and I can recommend this game highly! It's still in progress but it's worth it.

All the best to the Bless Team and Community

Let me start by pointing out that 1-7 hours is NOT enough to be qualified for a review. I hated blass for the first couple of hours, But once i figured out how my class works (paladin, one of the weakest classes untill later in lvls), Once i figured out how to maintain my stances, and combo the correct skills i started to actually see potential that bless can have if they continue their path. Right now the cash shop only has one major thing that you need and that is inventory slots. Good news, by the end of the main quest line you will have ENOUGH cash shop currency to buy 2 upgrades (unless you never use a bank that is all you will need).

Now lets not forget about the negative of bless, It is in no WAY one of the best mmos out there, But it is also not one of the worst. It has the typicle launch issues as well as the fact that the game is TECHNECLLY still being reworked (hence the missing classes). In the past 3 days the server has gone down for fixes, patches and alterations, they have added countless new servers as well. This is a company who i can see loves their game and is actually trying to impprove upon player feed back. 

As someone who has played EVERY major and minor mmo since ultima online i can say that bless online is indeed in need of work. It is not how ever the disater these ""reveiwers"" on here and youtube claim it to be. I can actually think of a few games far worse, lets go with just about anything snail games runs for starters. Now i will not sit here and tell you to buy the game or to avoid it, in all honesty my advice is -IF- you have the money sitting around buy it,try it and if you do not like it after 2-5 hours contact steam for a refund. Personally i will continue to play it as will my guild at least untill there is nothing left to do.


Things to note:

Pro:
Indepth custimization
No gender locked classes
Fairly simple combat yet the combos are more indepth
Rather friendly GM staff (from my own interactions with them)
New game so there is room to get ahead of the others (guild names,character names ect)
Rather friendly community (shockingly)

Con:
A few optimazation issues untill you tweak the INI file.
Not all classes have action camera (only zerver at this moment)
Some races can't be certain classes
Lots of negativity on the help channel from the same 4-8 people. (blocking works wounders)
Profanity filter that needs to be removed or reworked. Certain words are allowed others are not.

But hey this is early access and its to be expected, they originally said 1 NA server 1 EU server.. how wrong they were because they didn't expect this many people to play all at once. I think we're up to 8 NA now so at least they're trying to alleviate one of the problems.

I've been playing this game in KR and JP and I like the new combat, I think its an improvement. I think if people would just try out the game now that they've fixed the log in problems they would like it. We've got dev's that are communicating fast, addressing and fixing problems with much haste. They've even given us some in game currency as compensation for the mess that's happened the last few days. 

The game has decent lore, a nice character creation, only 5 classes atm Guardian, Paladin, Mage, Berserker, and Ranger but they'll be adding assassin mystic and Warlock soon enough. They've got a human and elf race for each faction, Union gets pantera Heiron gets Lupus, then we have a neutral race that both sides can get called Mascu. Eventually they'll add another Neutral race called Siren then Fedayin for Heiron and Ibliss for Union. 

They've added a buff system based on how many people are in the party you can select different buffs be it for combat for more exp or dmg or for life skills to craft faster or gather faster. Theres also buffs based on having different races in the party as well. The in game mount and pet taming system is pretty interesting NO LAME everyone gets a horse like some mmo's but if you want to ride a horse you can capture and ride it and level it. But you could also ride a scorpion or a leopard or a spider mount or any of the 600 pets and mounts you can tame in game.

I'm not gonna say this game is revolutionary, or genre defining or whatever BS buzzword people like to throw around for gaming magezines. Nor am I gonna shit on the game like some streamers who've played it for only 2 hours cause they couldn't log in, or looking to get twitch views by saying how bad the game is. I'm going to say the game is average but fun, and at the end of the day that's all you try to do in a game is have fun. 

Do you like crafting they have some of that, PVE dungeons they have that too, faction vs faction open world pvp and 100 v 100 battles. Granted we could honestly use some more dungeons, but those will be added later.

Play it or don't the choice is ultimately up to you, but make the decision yourself and not just what some streamer says.

Everyone who did NOT refund.... and still is actively playing the game is so warming, The community in game is not toxic like Other MMO's.

     I have had fun doing the PVE aspect of Bless and taming every thing the most so far. I find it is a fresh MMO that everyone who enjoys having a role such as healers or Tanking. Should TRY bless.

As if it was a brand new MMO, Try it with the knowledge that it is NOT perfect, but nor is any human on this fricken planet so, remember this... not ""OMGBESTGAMEVER!

Cannot teleport to dungeons without spending real money
Whereas in other popular MMOs you get teleported to dungeons for free, on Bless Online you are forced to either walk there or spend cash shop currency each time.

See: https://i.imgur.com/QF5QkoU.png

You would think that they would have at least included it as a $15 monthly sub benefit, but even that would have been bad. The developers are finding ways to milk players dry of their money in any way possible, even though the game just came out and is B2P (with an optional $15 sub AND cash shop). There is also no cross-server queueing for dungeons like you would expect from an MMO in 2018.

Infinitely loading splash screen bug and no communication from developers
The game needs to be restarted repeatedly until it finally loads, usually taking around ~20 client restarts each time. I myself have already restarted the game around 60 times today just to play a few times. This infinite loading screen issue has been present for well over 40 hours now, and the developers are not even acknowledging the issue or talking about a potential hotfix, even though thousands of players have been complaining about it all day long. It just feels extremely unprofessional on their end, both from an apparent lack of (any) testing and a lack of communication.

Inaccurate and absurd Toontown-like chat and name filtering
There is forced chat filtering (which cannot be disabled) that censors words such as ""how"" or ""who"" since the word ""ho"" is detected in them, which makes me feel like I am playing a broken version of Toontown from 2008. Players are restricted from using player names such as ""Muffin"" as well. For a game that has been in development since 2009 with a $60 million NA port budget, this is just outright embarrassing.

The reasoning for any form of filtering does not make sense either, since the game was marketed towards adults, and there is mild nudity in the game. You can also set your boob sliders very high and make your character very erotic looking.

Poor English Translation
The English translation is obscure and riddled with errors. Due to the poor translation, some quest tasks are too confusing to complete, and it is hard to understand what your character's abilities actually do. Even the most basic of things, such as the level up message that pops up each time you level up, has badly formatted text and is bunched together.

See: https://i.imgur.com/XHn0gH4.png

Lack of UI settings, screen resolution bug, and terrible default settings
It is not possible to change your screen resolution through the ingame settings without causing the game to freeze and blackscreen, which forces you to restart your PC. As of right now, the only way to safely change your ingame screen resolution is to directly edit the config files.

It is also not possible to customize the UI interface at all. You cannot resize core UI parts such as the chat or the mini-map. And there is a massive lack of game settings in general. Want to turn off the 60 FPS cap, increase your game FOV, or disable the inconsistent mouse smoothing? You have to manually modify the config files.

Terrible Optimization
I get 30 FPS and stutter in more than half of the areas in the game (even worse in populated areas such as the city), despite having a GTX 1080, i7 7700k and an optimized config. I can only imagine what sort of unplayable performance I would get in a 100vs100 battleground.

Streamers opinon about the game (both streaming with 100k viewers at the time): https://clips.twitch.tv/BlatantFineFriesBCWarrior

Item Dupe Bug
There is an item dupe bug that is still present from the previous, outdated versions of the game. There are already thousands of duped items, again without any acknowledgement from the developers about a potential rollback or anything. The fact that the developers even released the game, without fixing this known issue beforehand, is just beyond me.

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8dXV3AUwQQ

Buggy tab-targeting and lack of fluid action combat
When you tab target, it sometimes randomly targets the enemy behind you. An action-cam mode would fix this, but there is no action-cam mode for any of the classes except the Berserker, and even on the Berserker it does not feel natural.

Additionally, a lot of the attack animations lock you down in place so it does not feel fluid at all, and to make it even worse, some of the chain animations have a delay that makes it feel as if you are playing with 500ms.

Problems with potential future server merge / losing player names
Instead of adding shared servers and more channels, the developers decided to add 6 more servers on both NA and EU, which will become a huge problem in the future when the game's hype dies down. The servers will likely merge in an effort to boost player interaction, and some players will be forced to pick new player names (and maybe even lose their guild) due to them already being taken.

Excluding classes and content from the game on purpose
The game is missing the Assassin and Mystic and pretty much all of the endgame content that is present in other versions of the game, which the developers probably took out intentionally just so that they could gradually add the ""new"" content through the course of a couple of years without doing any real dev work.

And oddly enough, even though the Assassin class is not in the game, enemies still drop Assassin gear which is useless.

No Endgame - developers deceived players about there being one
The current version of the game, compared to the versions on RU and KR, is missing a lot of endgame features.

Some missing features are:
No Daily Dungeons
No Arenas or Battlegrounds
No PvP Ranking System
No PvP Reward System
Basel Canyon (main PvP map) is empty without mobs
No Royal or Honor Quests
Only two ""end game"" dungeons with exactly same gear score drops
SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, so you cannot progress past level 45.
Skill Gem acquisition is broken
No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)

The developers were quite deceiving about the lack of features as well -- selling founder packs and advertising a headstart as if there was an end to run to, plus falsely advertising about there being some end-game boss dungeons which are not present in the current version of the game.

Pay2Win, Overpriced Cash Shop, cash shop currency is CHARACTER bound
Cash shop currency is restricted to the specific character that you bought it on, rather than your entire account like in other MMOs, which is quite obnoxious.

And even though the game just came out and the developers claim a pure B2P, non-P2W marketing model, there are still a lot of convenience items in the cash shop, such as potions, experience and gold boosters, repair kits, resurrection scrolls, teleport scrolls, and even 20% dungeon point boosters. All of these items do give you a competitive advantage over other players even if only through faster progression, which I personally would consider P2W nonetheless.

On top of spending $30 for the game and an optional $15 sub, you still have to spend $20 on stuff like costumes, pet customes, pets, and mounts, or $15 to change your character's appearance. 

Want more inventory slots? Spend $10 for 8 inventory slots.

Want to reset your skill tree and try out a new build? Spend $5 in the cash shop for a reset scroll.

We were hoping this would be the next big thing, we REALLY hoped and we tried so hard to like it. I do actually enjoy the game, the lore, the story. I'll break down into my Pros and Cons. I've come from a long background of MMO's like Tera, WoW, Final Fantasy, ESO, DnD Online, Black Desert and more.

Pros:
Awesome character creator, no paywall.
Decent storyline with good voice acting.
Spells and Abilities look awesome.
The Instanced quest modes are cool.
Combat can be fun but maybe repetitive.

Cons:
Sluggish and old game engine.
Bugs - NPC's missing and names missing.
Gathering system not friendly without premium.
Dungeon teleport costs real money.
Bad lag from Australia - 270ms. (others are 190)
Melee classes can't play with ranged classes. If the ranger pulls aggro, the Paladin can't catch up.
Combat is 1-t-t or 2-t-t (the same 2 buttons) for combos.
If you don't buy Premium time, you are behind.
Premium only works per character, not account wide.
Berzerker being action combat makes it seem better than all other classes.

Granted I haven't played much, yes it's early access. But let's be real, it's been out for 2 years already. The main deal breaker is premium only being for one character, I like playing Alts.

Viele beschweren sich über die lags und freezes aber ganz ehrlich Leute, das Spiel ist im Early Access und da ist sowas normal.
Die Entwickler waren halt nicht auf diesen großen Ansturm vorbereitet und deshalb gab es hier und da Schwierigkeiten und nen holprigen Start.
Aber jetzt mal ehrlich, die arbeiten ununterbrochen daran die ganzen lags, bugs, freezes, etc. schnellstmöglich zu beheben damit wir problemlos zocken können.

Neowiz hat diesen Fehler kurze Zeit später behoben, so wie viele andere.
Warum also so haten und einen so schnellen Entschluss treffen das Game wieder zurückzugeben ?

0,48,6,2545,2545,76561198118868679,20,english,False,42414513,"Bless Online's publisher Neowiz pulled off the best bait of 2018 so far.This is as close to click bait you'll see from me but I promise there's a review in here somewhere.

I'm not going to waste your time and explain who Shroud is, if you know who he is great, but for those that don't, context is a lot of gamers watch his streams, and thousands of them try and kill him everyday in something called ""stream-sniping""

So, the creators of Bless Online, allegedly(I've reached out to both Neowiz and Mr Shroud to see if this is true) paid him a handsome sum to play the game on launch day.

His popularity sold copies of the game at a meteoric pace, suddenly servers began crashing and BLESS began to look like any other MMO launch an numerous players couldn't login for whatever reason.
Here's the thing. These launch day jitters were actually disguising many core issues with the game players would have immediate noticed. The game wasn't new or actually in early access it was attempting it's third launch after failing twice to find an audience, without getting into tech specs and details I'll sum it up: The game runs horribly, features static combat with awkward controls, even after rebinding keys the combos still felt horrible. It felt forced and heavy handed.

It's the gaming equivalent of ""The Room"" or ""Troll 2"". It wasn't even how bad it ran, it was the hilarious expectation for players to pay for an initial copy of the game, a subscription to the game($14.99 per month), and then micro-transactions you'd expect to find in a F2P mmo.

All of this paired with a murky launch and intentional obfuscation, every gamer wants to PK Shroud while he's streaming. Led to Steam lifting it's usual refund policy and refunding any player who purchased the game refund it during the grace period.

I gotta hand it to Neowiz, they picked the right streamer, they just pitched the wrong game. Attached are some of the funnier things about Bless. It had exactly one redeeming mechanic, you could tame and train mounts for almost all of the NPCs.

This game was packing allot of hype, its a stripped game of the other release in Korea and Japan, had to tweak the game .ini files to make the game playable in GTX 1080Ti .. had to config the game to run on 2560x1080 resolotion, still lags in town at some points.

I have no problems buying the game again, if they did add all the end game content, I feel its useless to farm to level cap to face a brick wall to do nothing else.

Antes que nada, comentar que es importante afrontar el juego como lo que es realmente: una beta cerrada con derecho de acceso para quienes realizan la compra del mismo. Eso de que el juego salió en 2013 o que ha fracasado en otras regiones realmente es falso. Puede que la base inicial de las distintas versiones saliese hace años y tuviese una base común pero, como desarrollador profesional de software, tengo claro que un mismo código base va sufriendo muchas iteraciones o modificaciones durante su ciclo de desarrollo. 

La versión actual, la que nos atañe, tiene varios meses de vida y ha incorporado cambios sustanciales (como el famoso nuevo sistema de combate). Puede que algunos elementos hayan cambiado poco respecto a otras versiones del juego (Kr, Ru, Jp), pero el juego, tal cual lo estamos jugando en su versión ""Occidental"", se trata de una NUEVA versión que debe de ser probada, depurada y optimizada. Y por eso se trata de un Early Access (o fase Beta) y NO de un lanzamiento oficial o release en ningún caso.

Aclarado esto, os comento mi experiencia:

He empezado a jugar desde que ha salido la versión base del Early Access (el de 29€), y no he experimentado ningún problema con los servidores o el juego: ni caídas, ni lag, ni crashes del cliente.

No aprecio problemas de caídas repentinas de fps, aunque bien es cierto que en grandes ciudades tardan en cargar y renderizar algunos modelos y los fps se resienten, pero en un porcentaje lógico.

El juego me parece bastante entretenido, no llevo mucho tiempo pero se me pasa volando. El aspecto gráfico, si bien hay ciertos elementos (sobre todo del entorno) que deben ser pulidos, está muy bien conseguido. El nivel de detalle de los personajes y de ciertos paisajes es muy bueno.

Respecto al contenido, se encuentra en una fase inicial con un high end muy limitado o prácticamente nulo. Sin embargo, esto es algo que ya se ha comentado y no veo que se trate de un problema estando en los primeros días de Early Access. 

Por último, respecto a las quejas del lanzamiento, era evidente que iban a haber problemas de estabilidad. Todo juego los tiene en su lanzamiento. Seguramente haya sido un error de los desarrolladores ofrecer unos packs de fundadores con algunos precios bastante elevados y con un acceso anticipado tan corto respecto a la base (48 horas) ya que ese suele ser el tiempo normal de estabilización de servidores cuando se lanza un juego tan esperado. Y así ha ocurrido. Ahora bien, los desarrolladores han pedido disculpas, han compensado las molestias y han corregido la mayoría de estos problemas con gran celeridad y manteniendo una conversación fluída con la comunidad. Bien por ellos.

Mi conclusión, se trata de un juego recomendable siempre y cuando se tenga claro que se viene a jugar a una BETA CERRADA y no a un lanzamiento definitivo. Es el momento de saborear el juego, tomarse su tiempo en subir personajes e ir descubriendo el mundo, ayudar a los desarrolladores a mejorar y corregir problemas y aportar ideas y críticas constructivas. No tengo dudas de que se trata de un juego con mucho futuro.

It's an Early Access title and shouldn't be played if you can't keep that in mind. 

It's a great game to play if you want to play casually, take your time, and provide feedback and constructive criticism that shape the future of the game. There are optimization issues and the tutorial, skills, and some tool tips are poorly translated. Endgame content is minimal for the next couple of weeks, and action combat class gameplay / balancing is incomplete. 
Character creation, leveling, crafting is all fun, hunting quests are rewarding - and you can convert those rewards to cash shop currency. Taming is a really cool feature and moving through the world is reminescent of vanilla WoW.

The early access release was not a success, many people had to wait in queue, got sutck on title screen, certain classes not available to play yet, and etc.; and after you get into the game there are ""problems"" like having to walk to the dungeon, open world pvp, combat system sucks and etc.

Now let me go after these problems one by one. Since early access, there have been a lot more servers added, the devs certainly weren't ready for the number of early access players, well they sold the packs on the day of early access, that is bad on their part, but not for long the problem was solved.
The title screen problem took longer, but was also fixed before the official release.

The devs have said about the classes not in game due to classes balancing, meaning they still working on how to make classes more balanced so you don't just see 8 out of every 10 players running around as Assasin. Yes, this is also bad on their part, but you know what you are getting, at this point I'm starting to think people on steam can't read, because all of these early access game get criticized for being ""unfisnished"", duh?! that's what early access means. The game is already playable for the most content, but is promised to deliever more in the future.

And for people complaining about teleporting to dungeons. This is a Korean MMO, for one, there are Wyverns all over the world if you can read a map, and every dungeon has one near them, and for two, if you really want to teleport, you can use Lumen which is obtainable by playing the damn game, and it's pretty easy to obtain.

For people complaining about combat, I was trying really hard to come up with a better word, but I'm sorry you are just bad. As I see most people grinding lvl31 dungeon in a party of 4 or 5, I'm doing it as 2 with ease, and I taught someone in the same class how to change some tatics around to get almost double DPS, and it was then I realized why people complain, they simply don't read what the skills do. As a veteran MMO player who's played FFXIV and BDO very competitively, Bless Online is definitely one of those games where you need to use your brain and practice, not simply smashing 1,2,3.

Also there are many ways to avoid PVP, such as changing channels, using the item that protects you from PVP for 10mins, or simply being better at the game and fight them off.",True,1527806786,1527806786,True,0,1,0.523810,True

I went against all negative reviews and gave it a try anyway. But I cannot recommend it. 

Confusing translations:
All texts are confusing, all I know is skills do damage, nothing else. The tutorial is really small and does not explain any stats.  

Performance:
When I was in the tutorial area I thought ""why is everyone complaining? this runs great!"", and then I left the tutorial area, the shortcut it played must have been with 5 FPS.  
Yes, I also did the configuration tweaks that some recommended, but still, in town or crowded area, the game lags like crazy.

Sortit en 2015 pour la première fois en Corée, et après d'innombrables remises en causes au fil de ses sorties au Japon et en Russie, c'est aujourd'hui l'occident qui a le privilège d'en profiter au beau milieu d'une période où le c'est le désert, plus sombre que le désert noir, dans le milieu des MMO. Entre ceux qu'on connait bien mais qui manquent de nous donner le frisson de la (re)découverte, et ceux qu'on attend parfois depuis trop longtemps, on lui reconnaitra donc son tout premier (et principal atout, soyons honnète) : il débarque au bon moment.

Est-ce le MMO qui va révolutionner le genre ? Surement pas.
Est-ce un bon divertissement pour autant ? Certainement.

Il serait bien naïf d'y jeter tout ses espoirs comme s'il allait être LE jeu qui vous fera oublier vos précédentes aventures. Mais c'est un jeu vidéo, pas votre nouvelle vie. A ce titre il rempli parfaitement sa mission de divertissement, n'en déplaise aux rushers qui s'ennuient après avoir joué 40 heures non-stop. La plupart des joueurs qui ne manquent pas trop de bon sens et savent l'apprécier comme tel, sauront s'y amuser, tantôt seul, tantôt avec leurs amis. Les autres vont évidemment le sacrifier sur l'autel du contenu, parce que ce n'est pas encore le jeu qui abreuvera tandis qu'ils se contentent de garder la bouche ouverte.

Neowiz ne prend pas de risque en le proposant comme un early access pour les 6 à 12 prochains mois. Le fait est que quand on accepte de le comprendre et qu'on ne place pas toutes ses attentes dedans c'est tout de suite beaucoup plus facile de l'apprécier comme tel. Bien entendu on veillera a faire le nécessaire pour que Neowiz ne se relache pas et profite de cette EA pour l'améliorer dans le bon sens.

L'Early Access, c'est un pont en construction ouvert au public : les pilliers montent, la route s'allonge peu à peu, l'architecture est parfois branlante et nécessite d'être solidifiée, mais on sait qu'un jour il permettra de traverser. Sauf que ça prend du temps. Toutefois personne ne vous oblige à visiter le chantier si vous avez mieux à faire ailleurs.

Qu'importe comment sont les autres versions à l'étranger, qu'importe le contenu qui manque pour le moment, qu'importe les bugs et la traduction. Bless a besoin d'affiner sa copie, de s'arranger, de se faire beau.

first of all i have had no issue with fps mainly due to my computers specs being above the average player base it appears, the only time i've ever dropped from 60fps in in heavily crowded zones, combat does not seam to affect the fps in my case, and the graphics settings are on high.

the things i wish the devs would look into changing would have to be the crafting system, it looks alot like an after thought and has not been optimized or streamlined at all. so far i have found zero uses for it and when i did attepted to use the handiwork system it just seamed far too complex for what i was going to recieve. 

the main questline was super fun and i really enjoyed it, i would have to compare the game mainly to skyrim in terms of the main quest, however my issue is with the side quests i feel that none of the ones i've completed feel very rewardining. like why would i spend time doing these side quests when i could be rinse and repeating a dungeon for better exp and better rewards, it has lead to zero insentive to complete these quests. 

from when i first started playing this game i had high hopes and i still remain optimizitc, if they are to change the crafting system and potentially make doing side quests more rewarding in terms of items opposed to minimal exp and coin this game would be worth playing. 

The combat system is really fun most likely one of the best to come out of an mmorpg and the design of the land is good but does seam a little dated even on high settings i have seen better textures and designs from other mmorgps

however in it's current state i would not reccomend it unless the devs are commitied to improving the game,",True,1527804898,1527804898,False,1,21,0.528898,True

Positiv:
- Grafik ist vielleicht nicht Stand 2018, aber durchaus hübsch und passend
- Tolles Zähmsystem für Pets und Mounts
- Charactereditor ist super
- Für mich ist die klassische Rollenverteilung Tank, Heal und DD super
- Super Latenz von 18 ms

Negativ:
- Performance unrund, es ruckelt. Ist vermutlich Serverbedingt, da egal ob Einstellungen hoch oder niedrig sind, es läuft immer gleich schlecht. Und nein, ich habe keinen 10 Jahre alten Rechner (I7 7700, Vega 56,16 Gig und Freesync Monitor)
- Kampfsystem ist mittelmäßig. Lieber ein klassisches Kampfsysten (wie WoW) oder etwas dynamisches (wie z.B. TESO)
- Deutsche Übersetzung nicht vorhanden. Stört mich zwar nicht, wurde aber so viel ich mich erinnere versprochen

Mein Fazit:

- c ets un remake de Wow au niveau du transport via les oiseaux entres les villes et bateaux volant 
- c est wow au niveau de la mort pareil que wow
-c est BDo niveau graphismes et monde vide (attention on est en EA mais parcourir des zones vides de pets et de tte vie fait peur parfois)
-Niveau graphismes et beauté du jeu , ben chez moi BDO est plus beau et c ets loin de ressembrer aux videos alléchante de la page steam par exemple.
-les combats dinamyque un peu moin que DBo quand meme (j ai un mage et ils on meme pousser le "" claquement de doigts"" quand le mag de DBO lanse ses sort c est pour dire copy copy)
-Il n est pas vide on croise partout des joueurs
-Je n ai à aucun moment eu du mal à me déconnecter  des serveurs ni étais éjecter comme certains le disent, MAIS , j ai souvent du lag car le jeu est c est sur mal optimisé ou codé avec les pieds!.
-j adore le fais de tamer les creature pour en faire des compagnons ou montures , Mais on fait vite le tour de la chose à mon lvl.
-il est en anglais donc je comprends rien à l histoire de toutes facon je farm comme un porc !
-on peu UN PEU modifier la pissance de nos sorts (je suis mage) ce qui peu faire qu en PVP ca peu faire une difference à lvl égale *attention spéculation  bien sur !

Alors en résumé j ai une pierre de TP de Wow , des graphismes à la BDO me manque le fun et la liberté d'un TESO, mais ca ne fais pas pour autant de lui  un mauvais jeu !

Pour son avenir , j'espere me trompé mais je le vois  pas meilleur que celui de BDO (pour le moment).

Pour moi TESO est tres loin devant!
Avoir jouer 7h ma redonné envis de réistaler BDO pour voire s il a évolué!

Je reste sur ce  bless online mitigé MAIS pas d'accord avec ceux qui disent qu il est mauvais en tous, non il apporte pas grand chose , mais il est comme WOW et BDO à leurs début ...un peu vide de tout.

Bin nach 15 Jahren MMOPRG wohl auch einiges an Ruckeleien gewohnt, aber hab schon wesentlich schlimmeres gesehen. FPS lagen stabil zwischen 20-30, Lags gabs keine. Liegt wohl auch an meinem FX6100 3,6GhZ Prozessor x6 Singlecore, da das Spiel aktuell nur über einen Core läuft und dieser kräftig sein sollte. Server war voll, Diamon. Deshalb bis dato Daumen hoch. Bis heute Nachmittag konnte man auch beide Fraktionen wählen. 30€ waren hier nicht zuviel Investitionsvolumen als B2P.

Zum Spiel: Is ein Lückenfüller zu Tera + Runes Of Magic + Black Desert. Denke es hat Potential. Das,was am meisten fehlt ist das Action Combat System. Aktuell kämpft man noch über 10 Kernskills mit verbundenen Kettenfertigkeiten von denen man nach dem ersten Skill dann wählen kann. Es gibt verschiedene ""Taktikkombinationen"". Das wird das Kampfsystem im späteren Verlauf spannender machen, als das klassische Targeting, wo man nur 1 drückt. Ansonstem ist das Charakterdesign auf westliche Standards sehr gut angeglichen worden, hab Ewigkeiten im Editor verbracht für Menschen und Pantera. Es gibt unterschiedliche Questreihen pro Volk, die Quests wurden vertont. Und zwar nicht so nervig wie in Elderscrolls. Durch 4 mögliche Charaktere und 4 Rassen hat man also genügend zutun. Wie man mit den Npcs spricht hat keine Auswirkungen auf das weitere Spielgeschehen. Bugs bzgl Sprache konnte ich bis dato keine entdecken. Gildengründung kostet 5 Silber, benötigt LvL 8 und eine weitere Person. Dadurch gibt es sehr sehr viele Gilden. Mal wieder. Ist aber okay. Hab heute bis LvL 5 gespielt, Mount gabs direkt hinterhergeworfen nach der ersten Questreihe, können aber auch selbst gefangen/gezähmt werden. Berufe gabs relativ wenige. Sammeln, Zähmen und Handwerk. Hab mich da noch nicht richtig eingelesen. Es wurde heute direkt was gegen Duper unternommen. Chatbots gibts bis dato keine. Die Zustimmung zum Spiel ist seit gestern von 33% auf 50% gestiegen. Emotes /Hinsetzen usw vorhanden, Marktplatz vorhanden, Handel zwischen Spielern nicht vorhanden. Endgame wird noch eingepatcht. Aktuell laufen Events. Die Städte sind riesig. Für 30€ und darunter kann man sich das schon mal ein solches Open World Game anschauen. Wer was Neues sucht wird ggf enttäuscht sein. Wer auf super duper Standards pocht, ebenso. Das Spiel ist in einer sehr frühen Phase. Wenn es sich entwickelt und man an den Problemen arbeitet, bin ich sicher,dass man das Spiel auch für westliche Verhältnisse zugänglich machen kann. Falls P2W reinkommt failed es hart. Bei F2P Option in den kommenden Monaten kann ich allen nur empfehlen sich das Ganze mal anzuschauen und mit wenigen Erwartungen ranzugehen. Man kann Spaß haben. Kann. Wenn man nicht an allem rummeckert und mit WoW vergleicht. Den Standard hebt dieses Game leider noch nicht. Die Unreal 3 Enginge Grafik ist in Ordnung, aber bescheidener als in manch anderem Spiel. Man merkt,dass das Ganze noch mit Direkt X9 läuft und sieht etwas wie Witcher 3 mit niedriger Grafik aus und spielt sich bis dato auch bis LvL 5 so, nur etwas dräger. Endgame kommt noch in Folgepatches. Bericht Ende. Wird gegebenfalls nachkorrigert, falls ich von dem Game doch noch schwer enttäuscht sein sollte. Hoffe es hilft.

It was rumourd that this game would replace BDO, it is nowhere near as fun as BDO... The Movement is clunky, the combat is awkward and the graphics look like they were designed by a 5 year old. All around i give this game a 4/10.
-------------------------------------------Real Review------------------------------------------
       Let me give you my review. When I say that the movement is clunky I mean that you use QWEASD to move and double tap W to sprint, Shift is not being used and you are unable to bind sprint to shift(it is in a constant state of double you forward movement button) Q and E are used to strafe left and right respectively while A and D are used to rotate. you are in a constant state of freecam until you right click then you can look around and see where you wish to go. (I learned in my last 5 minutes that you can look around and move in the diraction you are moving by holding left and right mouse at the same time. personally i did not enjoy this as it made it awkward for me)

       In regards to the combat you never use the mouse to engage in combat. You use 1,2,3,4 to attack and R (there maybe more but R was all i had access to) to use another attack to form the chain attacks that Bless had supposedly mastered. Moreso, you must be facing the target to attack which is a difficult task thanks to the movement system because, when you face them with your camera, your body is not facing them and it is your body that must face them so you must rotate using A or D.... All around the combat was bad and it is what mainly ruined it for me.

       Not much to say about graphics other than they are painful to look at.

       I may be speaking out of  my ♥♥♥ when I say that the game is P2W with the gear in the store but you are able to buy many things like tools and boosts in the store with their microtransaction currencies. I dont have to much on this, this didnt upset me much but it was sad that they had promissed not to include it in the game.

        finally, I rate the game 4/10 it would make the 5/10 range if the combat was better, the 7/10 if the movement was not so clunky. and a 8/10 if it was more optimised and the graphics looked a tad better.

Playing berserker ,currently the only class with reworked combat,enjoyable,tons of abilities,looks like pvp is going to be very skill intensive.

My personal problems so far :

I would like more class options,i typically play melee brawler types of classes that use claws or fists.
Also the only melee dps class is berserker,not a fan of that but its whatever,the class is unexpectably enjoyable.

Camera is akward if you change the maximum zoom out range.Placing you too far high above your character model.

Translation,many skill descriptions are blank,actual descriptions,quest text regarding your skills,ability names,flavor text can differ from one another.Quest text seems to be perfectly fine so far though.
They said they're fixing this.

Character creator is buggy,you cant change lighting even though the option should do it,causing me to make my character look worse than intended in game.
Not sure whats with the eyeliner option too,seems to be too blue instead of black?

That's pretty much it,im around 6~ hours into the game.

To sum up,people are full of shit about the fps drops and bugs and whatever the fuck theyre saying,im having 0 problems actually playing.

Overall Bless Online is a pretty good MMO and well worth the $30 price. Neowiz made it clear this is early access, that there would be some bugs and even warned about some potential launch problems, yet people still act like it is such an amazing surprise when a newly lauched game runs into a few issues. 

The combat system is a lot of fun. It's still tab targeted but a lot more interactive. I've only played two classes so far but really enjoyed the combat on both.

The taming for mount and pet system is addictive and it's just awesome to be able to tame just about any creature you see. 

Exploration is great as they built an amazing looking world. I've found myself going off the trail several times to enjoy the views.

The openworld PvP is missing a bit right now, but that's mostly because everyone is still just leveling up. That will change as more people increase in levels. The game has only been out a few days, so no one should be surprised when the more end game PvP isn't there yet. 

The party buff system is really interesting and I hope more games pick the idea up. I've found myself talking to a lot of new people just to always be in a party.

The game feels and looks 'old' and unfinished, it's from 2012 and it shows.
The UI is dreadfull, open something and the game 'hangs', some things don't even work (market).
Combat feels lacking, yes it's better then it was before but having no 'normal' attack feels weird. Also not being able to dodge and the 'lag attacks' makes it annoying.

The stuff in the cash shop is just crap.

Pontos Positivos:

- O jogo não possui nenhum P2W, os melhores itens são compráveis via Dungeon Credits (só obtidas fazendo Hunting e DG`s);
- O PvP não possui nenhum tipo de implicação contra o player;
- O novo sistema de combate é infinitamente melhor do que o JP;
- Gráficos muito bons;
- Ping para Brasileiros bastante amigável (120-140 no sul);
- Sistema de jogo bastante fácil de entender;
- Liberdade de escolha;
- Conteúdo bastante variável;
- Crafting tem sua utilidade (diferente de vários MMO`s que só existe para bonito);
- Baixaram o preço para a comunidade SA;
- Humildade em reconhecer erros e ressarcir/compensar a player-base;
- Entre outros...

Pontos Negativos:

- O lançamento foi conturbado, mas é complicado imaginar em 2018 empresas tendo esse tipo de problema, mesmo que a NeoW não tenha experiencia em publicar jogos, deveria estar preparada;
- Apesar dos gráficos serem bonitos, o jogo é mal optimizado, a culpa é obviamente da Unreal Engine 3 que é ruim para MMO`s (TERA e BnS usam ela), mas é de responsabilidade da empresa o quão bem optimizar ou trocar ela.
- Pouco ou quase nenhum End-Game, sim eles irão lançar na próxima semana, mas ainda sim poderiam ter lançado mais coisas no launch-day;
- Falta de várias coisas que anunciaram (action para todas as classes é um exemplo, junto com a falta do mega-server);
- No momento ainda existem instabilidades no servidor;
- Sistema de Vip basicamente inútil, para evitar o P2W fizeram um sistema de VIP tão sem graça, tem tantas coisas que poderiam fazer para um VIP sem deixar P2W (uma bag só para itens de craft como no TESO, uma aba extra para build de skills e coisas assim, simples que geram apenas conforto sem gerar P2W.


Porem quero deixar claro que o jogo está ótimo, a empresa está aprendendo muito rápido, corrigiram todos os problemas do dia do lançamento em apenas 3 dias, compensaram os players por isso e estão ouvindo e dando atenção ao pedidos da comunidade, tem tudo para se tornar um grande MMO e possui uma Player-Base forte. Não vieram para dar Cash Grab. Coloco fé no jogo, a maioria dos haters não tem nem 20 horas de jogo, o que não permite nem chegar no lvl 35, quanto mais saber do PvP e End-Game para poder opinar, outros vão mais longe ainda e fazem criticas que não tem sentido, muitas delas anunciadas previamente pela empresa (não ter assassino, jogo em DirectX 9 e etc).

I played nearly every MMORPG ever released,...few exceptions, because the Genre is a bit of a favourite of mine.
So I was a bit dissapointed by the early access NEOWIZ  provided. They failed a bit, but not necessarily more than around 90% of other MMOs on their first day of release.
Long waiting times, DC and emergency serverrestarts and downtimes are to be expected.

Apart from that, once I got to playing, I personally quite enjoyed it.
The Taming Minigame in itself is incredibly simple.
The Combosystem is quite interesting in my Opinion, even if slightly unflexible.
For Example, the combos are A-B-C-D in Skillorder, you cant really change that.
Meaning that you cant switch the Parts of a Combo. Overall its rather nice though, because the combos widely vary in damage and utility value.
So I kinda enjoy the combat, as far as I experienced it.

Overall ill give Bless a pass, because its, as I said, a nice MMO.
Not THE SAVIOUR OF ALL MMOS EVER, but a rather nice one.

Neowiz has does an excellent job listening to the community and adressing the issues one at a time. Lot's of people are upset and for good reason with all of the problems, but the outlook of this game looks good. As far as the complaints that there is ""no end game"" or action combat, this was stressed to us way before the launch of the game that it would be added in 1-2 weeks after launch, so in my opinion, that is not a valid complaint. I won't lie to you, there has been some lag/performance issues, but at least in my case it has mellowed out and has not been game breaking.

As far as the game itself, I have had a lot of fun. The combat is pretty cool and engaging. There are tons and tons of skill combinations for your ""combos"" in battle. You chain together different abilities on the fly. The combat is a bit like GW2 in a way, just not as flowy. Early game dungeons are soloable. Nothing fantastic, but good enough. Lots of mobs in the game can be tamed as mounts or pets, this is a unique feature i found interesting. Overall the game is good in my opinion. Not bad, not great, just good at this point in time. There is lots of room for improvement and from my experiences with the devs this game will continue to improve.

Was hier von vielen ""vorgeworfen"" wird entspricht nicht wirklich oder nur zum teil der Wahrheit.

Ich habe das Spiel egstern gekauft und auch gleich angespielt, das Login, Connection und die Performence Probleme, die hier ausgerufen werden, kann ich nach denn ersten 2 Stunden NICHT bestätigen!

Heute, habe ich mich mit einem Kumpel mal richtig rangesetzt und uns das Game gegeben (inzwischen LvL 22) und wir sind begeistert!

Ab und an ruckelt es kurz, wenn man eine Stadt betritt aber sonst ist mir gar nichts aufgefallen.
Nachdem ich die ini. Datei, wie im Internet beschrieben, einwenig überarbeitet habe, läuft das Spiel sogar besser als vor diesem Schritt. 
Meine Grafik steht auf 4 (5 ist das höchste) und 0,0 FPS Probleme. Ich habe eine geforce 1080 graka und einen i7 prozessor.

Die deutsche UI fehlt, das ist schade, aber sogar mit einem ""Schul-English"" kommt man da sicher durch jede Quest.
Die Entwickler wurden auch schon gefragt und es heißt es wäre ein Bug und es wird schnellstmöglich behoben (die Dateien für die Deutsche Version sind auch im Spieleordner schon vorhanden!)

Das Spiel an sich macht Spaß, es sind viele Spieler unterwegs, man bekommt Ingame sofort Hilfe wenn man Fragen hat.
Die Ladezeiten gehen schnell, kein ewiges warten.
Die Kämpfe fühlen sich klasse an, das Feedback beim Berserker, wenn er gerade einen dicken Angriff aufläd und raushaut, sind der Hammer!

Für mich haben sich bis jetzt die 40€ gelohnt, ich habe Spaß im Spiel und es lässt mich nicht los die Welt weiter zu entdecken und neue Monster zu bezwingen oder für die eigene Sammlung zu zähmen. ;)

Wir werden sehen was die nächsten Wochen bringen werden, ich denke es kann nur besser werden und deshalb empfehle ich das Spiele jedem der gerne mal ein neues MMORPG ausprobieren möchte.

Voici mon avis imagé du jeu.
Bless Online est au mmorpg ce qu'Ubisoft est à l'industrie du jeu video, un bon gros doigt bien charnu dans le c..
Certes je n'ai pas 300h de jeu, je tiens à ma santé mentale et cet étron vidéoludique n'aidera pas mes affaires.
Voici le détail de ce qui m'a plu dans Bless :
- Un gameplay aussi dynamique qu'un chat mort lancé du 4eme étage.
- Une histoire aussi profonde que le menton des frères Bogdanov.
- Des graphismes pas trop moches pour 2015, erf on est en 2018.
- Une communication du studio Neowiz aussi discrète qu'un pet de Nonne.

Bref un echec, le plus triste c'est qu'ils n'en sont pas à leur coup d'essai...
Au final ce jeu est une vaste blague, aussi drôle qu'Ellie Semoun, avec une passion aussi plate que Laetitia Halliday.

There is constant communication from the Devs about the problems that are plaguing the game right now. 

Day 1 The launch was rough but that is pretty much expected, I don't think a single game has ever launched with out issues. It doesn't matter if the game has been out in other countries there is a lot that has to be changed and reworked to work for NA and EU.

I love pretty much everything about the game so far, except outdated engine and etc. I believe in this game and I think they will be working on next version if this one turns out to be success. The mindset of developer is clearly in right direction in my opinion. 

I had 0 issues on early start, created a character and playing at 62fps(didn't turn off vsync yet). I like how targeting system works, maybe it feels awkward to you after playing BDO, but if you are familiar with Lineage2 you will feel comfortable playing with Bless targeting system. I won't go into details, but this type of targeting system makes games a lot more skillfull, since you can clearly apply back/side modifiers and you cannot abuse jump turn techniques. 

To me it seems like there is a payed negative marketing campgain against Bless, most probably payed by I won't name it another popular MMO that might loose a chunk of playerbase and get less profits from their p2w cashshops. 

People play 1 day on early access, reach highest level and complain that there is nothing to do. That happens in every MMO, there will always be people who reach end game first and they won't find any PvP or fun whatsoever(except some pve lovers cases). 

I like how devs don't give up and keep posting updates, fixing bugs and upgrading hardware. Eventually all the payed shills will go silent.  I won't be surprised finding them later on playing this game on Twitch saying how wrong they were.

- Compared to other mmorpgs (e.g. Guild Wars 2) the combat is not dynamic at all.
- No content yet, after level 45 you can start watching TV or scrim with the other faction players in open world PvP, nothing else.
- Mass-PvP (one of the main things advertised) not implemented yet, as well as the end-game content and dungeons.

beim ahead start gab es wie bei allen koreanischen games probleme, ich wunder mich immer das die Koreaner immer so blauäugig daran gehen, und sich dann wundern das am ersten tag die Server krachen weil man nix vorher runterladen konnte...

ich muss aber auch leider sagen, EA heist nicht Beta Test und leider ist das game wie damals LineageII zur beta rauskam gleichwertig, ähnliche Probleme nur halt für Geld im Vorraus, die heimlichtuerei was den nun kommt und wie und was überhaupt im Founder drin ist und was es macht war jedenfalls nicht gut, das hat schon für viel unmut im Vorfeld gesorgt, 

nichtsdestotrotz macht das team einen guten job die Bugs zu fixen, ""noch"" mal sehen wie das in ein paar jahren ist wen Updates kommen da wurde auch LineageII immer schlechter...

bis jetzt kann ich mich kaum beklagen das spiel läuft zumindest bei mir flüssig, ok hier und da hakt mal eine Quest die Skilltree ist für mich ein Buch mit Sieben Siegeln weil so grottig übersetzt das ich mit meinen Begrenzten Englischkenntnissen keinen Sinn erkennen kann, zb dieser Skill reduziert die Zeit des Zeitreduzierskills öhm...ja... 

Die grafik ist definitiv besser als bei dem Kindergarten wie WOW und Wildstar
die steuerung des Berserkers ist hmja hakelig undgewohnt für eine Deutsche Tastatur
das interface braucht dringend optionen zum anpassen, die Questen sind eigentlich ok auch teilweise Vertont, hier und da purzelt mal ein Text durch das Fenster weil koreanisch kürzer ist als Englisch, daher versucht es garnicht erst auf Deutsch, a kommt dann nur Kauderwelchs raus, und b wird das dann aus dem schlechten Englisch übersetzt...

das Spiel hat nerdfaktor, erinnert mich an meine alten Zeiten von Lineage, spielt sich aber definitiv anders, die optionen sine komplex und das macht es auf lange sicht interssant...

wer jedoch neuste grafik und keine Resets erwartet versteht offensichtlich nciht was eine beta *hust* ein Early Acess ist...

Ich möchte jetzt nicht auf die Details zum Headstart eingehen (bin Collector 150 Euronen) weil es keinen SInn macht. Ja ich war enttäuscht, ja ich habe mir mehr erwartet als einen einzigen Server EU Physis. Ich verstehe nicht weshalb man mit nur einem Server startet nachdem man doch wusste, dass so viele darauf warten.

Ok. Mein aktuelles Problem: Ich habe sofort auf EU Physis gestartet und weil ich ungeduldig bin sofort das Collector Paket geöffnet. Da ich berufstätig bin kann ich erst ab 19 Uhr spielen. DAS HEIßT Warteschlange 2 Stunden! Ok. Nehme ich mal so hin und verbuche es unter shit happens und wird schon wieder! Nichts da, Der Server wird sporadisch und regelmäßig erneut geöffnet damit noch mehr Leute Charakter erstellen können..! Warum? Bietet doch für eine Woche kostenlose ""Server-Transfers"" an damit die Leute zu Ihren Gilden und Freunden können.

Zum Spiel: Aus meiner Sicht gibt es aktuell kein MMO RPG deshalb spiele ich Bless Online. Bis jetzt finde ich es auch garnicht so schlecht und sehe auch Potenzial. (Vielleicht hätte ich kein Ragequitt in BDO hinlegen dürfen, LOL)

Ich werde es weiter spielen und freue mich (hoffe) auf eine gute Community und nette PVP-Battles.

I don't care much for endgame, and if I so happen to reach it, I go through it painfully slow. So that point of critique isn't particular concerning to me.

The reason I refunded it, is the abysmal performance. I'm one of those people who are okay with things running at a smooth 30 fps. And my PC is in the low end of this game. Even after applying all suggested tweaks, config edits and the likes, there was no chance in hell it would run anything but stuttery.

Nevertheless I likes the content design. The characters and structures look good. The character designer is really nice. and usable, unlike in BDO, where you can fiddle with the sliders for hours, and still end up with a variation of the same character.

The sound is good.

The combat system is OKAY, albeit I didn't see much of it obvsly.

It's a good game, if you are not in super hardcore mmo mood. Otherwise you will be utherly disappointed.

But if you rig can run it somewhat smoothly, (nonewithstanding the fact it should, no matter what its specs are) and you don't mind the current lack of endgame, by all means: Buy it. Although the longlivety of the game is pretty much in the negative as far as I can see.

Combat is animation based. No GCD. Build variety is decent. Levelling is quick, but there is progression past cap for passives. Dungeons require you to travel to the entrance in the open world, and from 31 onwards these entrances are PvP contested. Decent pet/mount system. Some gear affects abilities instead of only increasing stats. Good music. Decent sound effects.

The major issues are everything but the game systems themselves. Namely, the optimization, the web-based marketplace interface, and the general server and communication issues. These issues make the game feel cheap and outdated; as if it were more appropriate as a free-to-play MMO than a buy-to-play.

The minor issues are that the game is missing endgame content for now, it is severely unpolished, not all classes are implemented yet, the game world feels empty (doesn't feel alive - lacks NPCs), the UI is not customizable, some basic tasks are inconvenient as the game needs more QoL features, and until arenas and battlegrounds are implemented there is a lack of incentive to PvP. These issues are minor because time will resolve some of them, and the others can be fixed without major overhauls.

I recommend it to anyone who is fine with only doing open world PvP and crafting/gathering for the forseeable future. I love both of those things.

I do not recommend it to anyone who likes to PvE a lot, or enjoys arenas and battlegrounds over open world PvP. Also, if you do not like tab target, do not bother with this game until action combat is implemented for all classes. I prefer tab target.

I dont write reviews often so my point will probably short, but I do not like how other reviewers change certain details to make it seem worse.

**[TL:DR Buy or nah? If you dont mind that it wont run as smooth as youd want then its worth a try. You will experience fps lag or server lag but it wont be terrible in my experience and it has been improving. Day 1 was horrible in comparison. However if you dont want to experience these problems when youre paying for the game then dont buy it. Its completely understandable not to want it due to bad optimization.]**

OPTIMIZATION is a problem. You can expect FPS drops especially in cities however for me it hasnt been as bad as some people say. My setup is pretty mediocre having a gtx 750 graphics card, i5 core and my fps stays mainly around 40 with medium graphics settings, but it only really lags in some areas mainly in cities and its still playable. People with better setups have reported harder fps drops but my experience hasnt been that bad. 
 
The LOADING SCREEN bug happened to me but I just switched it to windowed mode on startup and it was fixed, so dont really see that problem anymore.

TRANSLATION does need work, a lot of times some sentences are awkwardly written but you can still understand what theyre trying to say.

COMBAT, ive only used the zerker so far and Ive enjoyed it. Stance switching and chain skills take getting used to but they dont feel slow at all. The other classes dont have the action camera so I d have to play them to see how it feels.

NOW WHATS REALLY BUGGING ME is stuff like ""you need to pay to teleport to dungeons"". Okay yes if you wanna teleport sure, but you know you could you also just fly there with the traveling system they have set up. If youre following the story (why wouldnt you) then you wont even be that far from the dungeons you need to get to, and theres also recall similar to a hearthstone from WOW, so theres ways of moving around. You dont have to just walk like some people make it seem. AND even if you did have to walk theres an auto run feature thats sets its own path and you can literally afk while mounted but still they insist you either pay 10$ to tp or walk. Just with that dumb statement, I would even listen to their arguments. Stuff like bugs they alrady fixed too, and more importantly the game by no means is P2W.

[Rant about p2w, can ignore]
I repeat, the game is not P2W. Unless you consider exp and gold boosts p2w. Which arent for the simple reasons that exp is useless since you level up pretty quickly, and if youre less than the level cap theres always gonna be someone higher than you no matter the game. Doesnt make it p2w. especially since exp boost is just useless once you reach level cap. So how can something that turns useless so fast be p2w? Its not. Gold boosts, I can see why they might be considered p2w if it werent for the fact that money in this game like in others wont really make you any stronger than someone else. You either get the gear you need from the dungeons or you can buy cheap gear from merchants with money you wouldve earned anyway without boosts. Or you can also just craft. Some one with 10,000 gold wont necesarilly be stronger than someone with 6,000 gold. And btw it only boosts gold from monster drops so yeah instead of lets say getting 20 silver you get 27 silver. Nice.

Anyways theres some misinformation going around is all, sorry for that last rant. 

OVERALL biggest problem for most is gonna be the fps lag but for me it hasnt been terrible. Havent encountered any bugs yet apart from minor quest lag.

Ich war als ich das Spiel das erste Mal auf Steam entdeckt habe, im Vergleich zu anderen Spielern, völlig unvoreingenommen. Ich habe von Bless vorher noch nie was gehört - das macht meine Review auch relativ neutral. Bisher habe ich vor allem Erfahrung in World of Warcraft - und das wirklich viel - sammeln können.

Zu Bless online - Kurzzusammenfassung:

┅¦ ☀ Grafik ¦┅
☑ OK - Nichts besonderes, eher zeitlich hinterher

┅¦ ツ Schwierigkeit ¦┅ 
☑ Man sollte ""Englisch"" verstehen - sonst wirds schwierig ;-)

┅¦ ϟ Bugs \ Fehler ¦┅ 
☑ Leider immernoch einiges an Fehlern / Bugs... Aber das hat EA wohl auch an sich ;-)

┅¦ Fazit ¦┅ 
Ohje. Weiß gar nicht was sagen. Ich bin nun mit meinem Charakter auf Level 33. Habe versucht, von all dem Content ein bisschen was mitzunehmen. Hunting Quests, Main Quests, Side Quests, Dungeon und PVP. AN sich ist auch alles eine ganz tolle Idee, aber mir fehlt einfach was, was mich fesselt. Die Dungeons - zumindest bis zu diesem Level - waren öde. DIe ersten Zwei davon bin ich Solo gelaufen... Ehrlich? Solo? JA! Solo! Versteh ich wirklich nicht. Dachte immer, das Dungeon sollte in Gruppen absolviert werden, das fordert auch das ""Multiplayer Feeling"".

Das Kampfsystem war für mich was Neues. Allerdings, sehr stupide. Das heißt, man eröffnet den Fight mit einem Skill (1-8) und führt diese ""Chain"" (Kette) dann durch stupides Drücken der Tasten R-T-Y fort. Im Vergleich zum Kampfsystem von BDO ist hier bei Bless einiges schief gelaufen. Bzw. Langweilig!

Die Grafik ist alles andere als Atemberaubend. Man merkt einfach, dass das Grundspiel eigentlich schon Jahre alt ist. Dennoch ist die Anforderung an den Rechner extrem hoch. Ich habe einen i7 8700K, eine GTX1080TI und 4000er RAM - und dennoch in der Stadt unter 80FPS.
Achja, da sind wir beim nächsten Punkt. Die FPS sind auf 60 gelockt. Diese muss man (z.b. durch einen Guide auf Reddit) unlocken. Genauso kann durch Rumspielerei in INI Dateien das Spiel ein wenig optimiert werden.

Das Spiel ist für mich nun vermutlich Geschichte. Viel Spielzeit werde ich nicht mehr investieren. Wenn ich könnte, würde ich Refunden... Leider unmöglich!

Wünsche dennoch allen Spielern die daran Freude haben viel Erfolg und guten Loot.

По существу - лагало только при первом прогрузе. При том что использую впн, пока РКН не добавит в список исключения. 
Боевка стала более живой, но имхо не для дальников. Скорее всего будет удобнее играть с джостика чем с клавы.
В игре я вижу огромнешое количество плюсов базово, но рассказывать их смысла в сути нет, лучше обрисовать то что мне не понравилось 

1) Начальные локи убиты. Там нет квестов а вид внешний и интерьер остался. В итоге ходишь как по кладбишу.
2) Не самая лучшая реализация крафта. Если раньше нам было доступно все - то теперь выбирай специализации. Ну какжеться ок, нормальная тема а.... рецепты только для одной професии кузнеца. Явная недоработка, которая будет исправлена, но пока это так.
3) Игроки. Что не игрок то фрик с ужасным чаром. Ну и менталитет пиндосов/европейцев... ну его. 
4) Маунты, теперь они требуют хавку а батарейки у них ну через чур сильно садяться. В итоге их надо действительно много. Если раньше из гиракона до шахты (30й данж) требовался 1 маунт и чуток времени, то сейчас 2 посменно использованых + доп время на их самон, да и сами по себе стали медленными.
5) Тюрбанов нет, пичальбеда. Вообще с одной стороны они сильно портили геймплей, с другой... ну реально долго все это качать.

É a primeira vez que faço e um review, nunca fiquei tão irritado tentando jogar um jogo e só o faço para alertar quem pretende jogar essa m.

- O jogo mal com roda com um i7 7700K + GTX 1070. FPS fica em 20-30 em vários momentos do jogo.
- O jogo roda todo travado, nada é fluido nesse jogo, você solta um peido e o jogo dá uma travada.
- É possível escolher entre diferentes raças mas não vi diferença nenhuma. Não sei porquê colocaram.
- Tem Skills demais e nada relevantes! Mal começa o jogo e você tem umas 8 skills diferentes pra usar, várias que fazem praticamente a mesma coisa com pouca diferença.
- Tutorial é horrível, não é nada intuitivo.
- Storyline é praticamente uma cópia genérica de outros MMOs;
- O jogo foi praticamente feito pra quem só joga MMOs, o jogo não tem nada de novo para atrair pessoas novas para o gênero, “vamos tirar o que der de dinheiro que daqui 1 ano aparece algo melhor”.
- Pode ter certeza que esse jogo vai ser P2W mais pra frente.

Enfim, como já disseram nos outros reviews os pecados desse jogo são simplesmente imperdoáveis para 2018. Dez anos atrás até vai, hoje não tem como.

Das ganze wirkt wie ein schlechter free to play Witz um mal schnell ein paar Moneten von ausgehungerten MMO Fans abzugreifen.

Meine Refundbegründung lautet wie folgt:

Genau genommen müsste ich ALLE vorgeschlagenen Begründungen auswählen. Es macht keinen Spaß, es stürzt andauernd ab, die Performance ist unter aller Sau, ich habe 1 1/2 meiner 2 Stunden Spielzeit damit verbracht Lösungen für bugs und die mangelnde Performance zu finden, das Spiel wurde mit Inhalten beworben, die nicht Teil des Spiels sind (es wurde schlichtweg gelogen), die deutsche Übersetzung ist nicht vorhanden und die englische ist so schlecht, dass man kaum etwas versteht. Dazu kommen etwaige Verbindungsprobleme und Wartezeiten. 7 Jahre alt ist das Spiel und der jetzige Zustand ist sowohl unzumutbar als auch Schande für das gesamte MMO Genre. Das ganze dann auch noch zu solchen Preisen unter dem Deckmantel ""Early Access"" zu vermarkten ist milde ausgedrückt eine Frechheit.

Most nem biztos hogy ez a tuti vétel. Aki kicsit szerényebb vassal rendelkezik és szerelmese a keleti mmo-knak, várjon egy kis időt, amig a szervereket és a játékot is kicsit ráncba szedik, ahogy ígérik. Jelen állapotában élvezhetetlen számomra is. Bő 2 és fél óra utána, visszatérítést is kértem.  

Amin játszottam I7 proci, 16 gb DDR4 ram, 970 GTX  100mb/s nettel, szóval nem a legfrissebb minden a setupban, de azért nem is utolsó, és mivel a játék gerince is elég idős, nem gondoltam hogy problémám lehet. 

Bővebben:
A játékról sokat nem tudok mondani,  (4. faluig evickéltem el, addig minden ugyan az mint bármelyik másik game-ben) mert a 2 és fél óra jó része azzal telt, hogy kitaláljam, hogyan lehetne még is játszahtóvá tenni. 
Első és legnagyobb problémám, amit aztán nem is sikerült megoldanom a folymatos szaggatás, akadozás abszolút minimum grafikán is fps lagg, egy olyan szerveren ahol magamon kívül délelött 4 játékossal találkoztam.

Ez azért bosszanot fel igazán, és nem tudok a legkevésbé sem elnéző lenni a fejelsztőkkel szemben, mert ha az elmúlt 10 évben ez lenne az első koreai játék, ami EU-ba szertne gyökeret verni, az ilyen gyerekbetegségek benne lennének a pakliban. Azonban ez messze nem így van. Szinte ugyan azok a típus hibák, optimlaizálatlanság, és kifogás tenger a fejlesztők részéről mint általában. Sajnos.
Ha valóban hosszútávra terveznének a koreiak nálunk, akkor felkészülhettek volna kezdésre bőven a várható játékos állomány mennyiségére, a játékra használt gépek minőségének széles skálájára, (low-high). Ezekről mind informálódhattak volna bármilyen statisztikai cégtől, évekkel ezelött, hogy mi várható a megjelenéskor. Mint ahogy teszik ezt azok, akik komolyan gondolják és fordítanak rá energiát. 
Rengetegen játszanak koreában és japánban elég is lehet a kapacitás, de nem lehetnek több mint az EU 700M+ össznépességében, utalva a laggokra, és dc-kre.
Ez mellett 2018-ban a DX9 helyett egy DX11 vagy ha tényleg szeretne a jövőre gondolni akkor DX12 kompatibilitás sem ártana. Főleg a tendencia fényében hogy ma már az EU-s Windows felhasználok 50% is Win 10-et használ. Lehet egy 6-7 éves gépen jobban futna, viccen kívül.

Az is a bajom, hogy ez megint azt erősíti benne, hogy az ilyen trehányság mögött az ""ázsiai-féle"" játék terjesztési és sablonos mmo gyártási gazdasági modell áll. Az olyan közönség a fő cél nálunk is, mint jellemzően koreában. Rengeteg időt, energiát és pénzt is fordítanak a játékaikra és a gépük fejlesztésére, hogy lehetőleg a toppon legyenek, ha más nem is. Az ő esetükben gondolom zökkenő mentesebb lehet a játék a vas miatt, még ha nyomorognának is a szerveren, és elég forgalamt biztosítanak a game shopban is különöbőzö kozemtikai elemk vásrálásával, és a havi prémiummal, hogy a kontentet fejlesztgető cég eléldegéljen. 

Alapvetően nem szeretem ezt a modelt és nem is támogatom az alap játékon túl, de maga a játékért a közösségért játszottam minden ilyen fajta mmo-val, ami átjött hozzánk is. A b2p-es single, főleg dobozos formában és havi díjas mmo-játék modellt támogatom, ahol a havi befizetés nem prémiumot ad (hogy példáúl több a rested exp-t kapj, többet tudj szakmázni egy nap, késöbb kopik a felszerelésed, jobb encsa esély, nagyobb a bag, lehet telked, csak IRL-s pénzért váltható játék currencyt kapsz, és sorolhatnám), hanem jogot ad a befizetőnek hogy játszon, ugyan azzal a játékkal ugyan úgy mint bárki más. 
Ezért is vártam nagyon a game-t, mert a hírek szerint ezen sötét foltok jó kezelése mellett, (elmondások szerint minimális elönyt, idő spórolást nyújtó prémium), a játék menete, harc rendszere, ígért end contentje is mind kicsit másnak tűnik mint az eddigiek. Látni bennük a lehetőséget az újítársa.

Szerintem rövid időn belül kiderül merre tart a játék. Mit hoznak a gyors patch-ek a következő hetekben, és mi várható általánosságban fél éven belül.
Akkor majd visszatérek rá.

This is a review I was really hoping to be a ""thank the gaming gods we have a new MMO.""  Unfortunetly Bless in its current state just doesn't get there.

If you just want the short TL:DR version skip to the bottom.

Graphics -  The use of an old engine didn't help.

Bless looks good easpecially from the back of a wyvern taxi or when roam around a town.  But when that town is populated by players the graphics hit a wall.  When you first walk in / or land from that great looking wyven ride, everyone is either a stand in model (they're standing with arms out in there underwear not moving) or they are all wearing a basic grey scale armor.  Npcs are not to be seen just then either.  In a few seconds everything catches up and players look like they are suppose to.  But then comes the choppiness of low FPS.  I have a solid rig, I run most games on highest setting, but even after the reddit suggested changes to the ini files (which let me just state a consumer should never have to do) my FPS never got higher than 45 and dipped to 15 of less quite regularly.

Sound - solid other than the really annoying system voice contantly repeating ""This is a safe zone"" or ""Choose a valid target""  And no there isn't a way to turn her off from what I saw.  And she talks alot, a bonified motor mouth.

Controls - (This may change once they actually get around to implimenting the action combat they hyped about)

Walking around, interacting with things, talking to npcs, all well done.  The controls are what you'd except.  Even basic combat against a target that has no real threat of killing you or special attacks.  The controls while different are something you can use.  Although having a razor or other mouse with extra buttons makes this easier.  But you still have to take your hand off either your mouse if you map to numeric pad or your ASWD movement keys at some point to use attacks.  So when you do encounter something that can kill you or that requires you to move alot combat controls become much more difficult. I'm sure there are ways to remap this to be avoided but it just seems a bad choice given ALL their effort was put in to the combat system revamp.

Bugs - I'll just leave this one at that one word.  I'm sure in time they'll squash most of them.  But to release for the 4th time with that many.......

Translation to English - VERY ROUGH. Some of the text just doesn't make any sense at all.  And when it's your skill tooltip or a quest description that make for a very rough go of things.

Crafting - Again this seems solid at least on the surface.  An other than being time & resource heavy could be so peroid.  But not until they lift the no player trading ban.

What I didn't think of at first & I'm sure I'm not the only one.  In any other MMO that I've played professions at some point require or are at least made a lot easier by being able to rely on friends / guildmates that pick up things their profession doesn't need to help you fill the missing pieces of what you do need and vice versa. (eg. I have extra stone and the enchanter needs it.)  Well thanks to the no player trading policy Bless currently has I can't give that stone to my frirend/guildmate, not through trade or mail.  I know you're gonna say just go get it yourself, and yes they can, just seems anti-MMO mentality in some ways.

The last point I want to touch on in crafting is the lack of being able to give finished items to friends/guildmates.  One really bad example I ran into was the Taming Orders.  Taming mount/pets in Bless is a big part of it, the bonuses a pet/mount can give an up and coming player(even guild with guild XP ability) is not to be over looked.  At the taming system is a selling point of Bless.  Yet unless you are an enchanter you can get Taming Orders for mobs over level 15 without either being an enchanter, making an alt and leveling it enchanter, or buying the item from the market(which there are none since everyone needs them).  Again becuase my friend/guildmate can't give/take anything to/from me.

Taming system - Outside of the lack of the item to be able to tame higher level mobs.  The taming mini game itself is solid.  The shear amount of mobs you can tame seems pretty vast.  I can across very few things that coldn't be tamed.  The leveling system for tamed mobs on the other hand is painful.  Maxing out the tamed mobs level isn't difficult just have it out while playing, other than time that part is simple.  But when it comes to upgrading the pet/mount that when it gets uphill.  You have to ""feed"" one max level to another max level, but here's the kicker unless they are the same type the percentage chance of success starts around 5 - 7 %, if it is the same then you get ~ 15%.  Now to be honest every failure increases the next chance but you only get so many chances and each teir gets harder than the last.  So basically it becomes a huge time sink that all comes down to luck.

Servers - I won't go into the server issues and que times as they seem to be on top of it and the offical release day other than being down for a 2 hour mainatance I didn't see a que time.  And all MMOs suffer from this at launch.

TL:DR
Graphic - don't live up to the hype let alone the standard.
Sound - Good outside of the contant system voice's nagging
Tanslation - Lacking, not being able to understand a quest or what a skill does due to bad 
                    english makes playing the game difficult.
Gameplay - 
   Combat - Rough - the movement Vs avoidance coupled with the way you're suppose to 
                   chain combos together makes doing so difficult.

   Crafting - hobbled by lack of trading

   Secondary objectives(taming) - hindered/time sink

Overall - Needed more time in testing and an overhaul from the results that testing would've given.  As it stands now, not worth buying unless you like fustration.

It's truely sad as this game has/had soo much potential.  But between all the issues it has gameplay wise, the rough feel for a 4th launch, and the old engine behind the graphics.  It seems like its just too much for Neowiz small team of 176 people to overcome.

- Unnessary boosts to XP gains
- Uncalled for censorship
- FPS issues
- Bad translations on talent descriptions. 
- Emotes not lining up correctly

But the other parts of the game seem to be moving much better, the game has a decently elaborate character creator with a wide array of options. High quality graphics (just don't look too closely the plants are a mirage!), given that the game was made in U3 around 6-7 years ago the graphics are high quality for its time. 

The reworked combat system is smooth, with two sets of abilities, non chain and chained abilities. Though the developer is intending on enabling action combat for all classes eventually that though is in the future. 

Plenty of work still needs to be done however on class balance, it's more of a game of who can stun/one shot you first as all the classes can completely wreck you if they jump on you. But with a couple of years of content behind them from a previous release hopefully all those issues will be quickly sorted out.

Half of the points of most of the negative reviews are either opinion or have been addressed already.

Now onto my review.

Graphics: They look like they're from 2010. Ugly by today's standards but servicable.

Gameplay: Combat feels rewarding and spell and attack animations are flashy and satisfying. The combo system is a bit clunky in my opinion but by the end of the first day I got used to it and learned to love it. It's all about building muscle memory.

Performance: It's an older engine and was clearly not adjusted to mordern machines. Various INI File tweaks are required at the moment to unlock the game's full potential. If you can look past that fact, it is very forgiving with even the most potato of Modern PCs able to handle it.

Verdict: 7.5 out of 10

The game is good, not great, just good. It was never going to be the [INSERT POPULAR MMO] Killer and it never had to be.

It just needed to be a solid foundation from which Neowiz can build upon, and this game is indeed solid.

In today's MMO Market that's all we ever really needed.

- Performance. OMG! FÜr ein​ Spiel mit einer uralten Engine, welches dazu schon seit einiger Zeit in anderen Märkten hätte technisch reifen können erwarte ich deutlich mehr! Hinzu kommt, das ca. 60 Millionen Dollar in den EU-Port geflossen sind... was haben die mit dem Geld gemacht? 15 FPS in der City mit einem high-end PC?

- Übersetzungen. Wie kann man sich nur so wenig Mühe geben bei der Übersetzung? Ich sag nur ""combat poisoning"" beim Skill-Tutorial. Ich lach mich neukrank. Oder beim Levelup: ""You are now 12 level."" What? Für ein AAA game ist das echt mies. Von den bescheidenen Skill-Übersetzungen in meiner hotbar fang ich erst gar nicht an zu reden.

- Bereitgestellte Server. 1 EU/NA (Mega )Server für ein neues AAA MMORPG release? Wie in aller Welt hätte der Plan aufgehen sollen?

I am shocked on how many streamers and youtube guys were playing this game never really bringing out serious facts about this game. all the fkn time we have to test it ourself.

first of all I have to say that I didnt have the splash screen stuck issue, nor some lags during the game. sometimes the frames were running low but that wasnt a major problem for me.

I did some ini file tweaks everyone suggested to get rid of one of the major issues I had, which was the camera-fov perspective.

the game felt like watching a 2 dimensional image and scrolling it sideways when turning. gave me headache.
with a little change in the ini files its okay now.

BUT.....

- the graphic looks worse than expected, we have 2018 now and yes some games are using low graphic to have a better performance. but removing 50% of all details on the map + having really bad graphics with Unreal Engine 3 is a no go for actual mmo fun in 2018

- movement is the worst I have seen in ages. the only class that allows a mouse view/look is berserker which feels almost normal but all the others have RMB+hold mouselook. clunky combat movement, idiotic fights ...   sometimes youre just too lazy to turn or what not.

I dont need ultra realistic graphics, but it has to fit the gamestyle and should look pretty at least. warhammer online was a pretty game with low graphics. bless is very much disappointing in that way. 

let's see what happens in future ....  ^^


-----
50hrs playtime edit: 

1) they fixed onehitting monsters and made it worth forming parties for dungeons 

this is very good, because now it feels like one of these mmo's you were missing throughout the years. it feels good being a full healer in a party again since most mmo's nowadays  gave a F*** about full support roles. 

since I haven't reached endgame yet , I keep playing and see if theres anything that can make me quit.

2) I'm getting used to rmb+hold look again and they just stated that theyre working on giving all classes action targeting back, except paladin.

Yes you can't trade with other players. Yes there are technical issues every which ways you look. Yes the translation is straight out hilarious at best and confusing at worst. And yes there are funny bugs, there are weird glitches, and there are game-breaking sh*ts.
But what most people ""conviently"" forget is this is A RELEASE WEEK. Like, seriously, name me one smooth MMO launch you've experienced. Go on. Did I hear ""Archage""? Pffft. ""WoW"" ? Nice try, next. ""BDO""? Don't make me laugh. Bottom line is, this is EARLY ACCESS, stuffs are bound to be broken. Maintenances are bound to take place. What matters is the dev's responses. And I daresay they're been quite responsive to the community. Not the best in the business, sure, but I like how they're handling the release nonetheless.
With all that said, I'll get straight to the main point that I'd like to say: THIS GAME HAS POTENTIAL. This is easily the closest thing you can find to ArchAge 2. Sure it's a Korean MMORPG. Sure there is no breathtaking visuals. Sure combat is nowhere near groundbreaking. But it doesn't have to be. Right now all the solid MMORPG on the market are....aged. I'm tired of FFXIV's global cooldown on most skills. Even WoW got bored after 1000th-ish hours. We need a new solid traditional MMORPG. It doesn't have to be innovative. It doesn't have to be fancy. It just needs to be solid. And I see the potential for Bless to be a solid MMORPG. Here's why:
1. Taming system. They claimed almost every monsters you see in game can be tamed. And so far that's true. All monsters I came across are now my pets. See that raccoon wankering around? Yours. See that majestic rhino minding its business? Yours. So far I like this system. A nice distraction to have while grinding.
2. PvP are not bound in instances. Ok this is a very, *VERY* controversial topic so i'll just put it like this: it's god damn fun. I was rekt by some lv45 dude camping the mobs. So i turned to faction chat for help. ""*insert other faction* is camping *XYZ* map. Pls halp"". It soon turned into a god damn blood bath as the other faction also called for more peeps. A grinding area turned into a massive PvP mess while faction chat is crammed with calls to arm. Easily the best 2 hours I've had with the game. Yes I died alot. But I also managed to snipe a few max lvers. All in all a memorable experience.
3. Combat system. Yes it's tab targetting. Yes it's basically smashing buttons in a specific order. But a well done one nontheless. Combos are varied (by the time my archer reached lv30 I already have 11 different combo, each with their own use) and has a learning curve on it (I only have 2 classes atm so I'm not sure about the rest, but boy they took time to get used to). 
4. Stance Dance. It's soooo solid I feel like this deserve its own section. Takes Paladin for example. You got a stance for dishing out hurt (which makes you kind of a DPS). You got a stance with many damage mitigations (which makes you a tank). And then you got a MP regen stance (the other two stances will drain your MP like crazy). I ended up having to constantly switching stance to best suited for different situations. Suddenly combos does not feel like mindlessly smashing buttons anymore. I now have to constantly thinking about what next skills/stances to use. 10/10

TL;DR: This review is set to recommended because Steam does not have some sort of a mixed between Yes/No. Yes I recommend this game, but *NOT* at this state. Give it a few patches. Please Neowiz, please don't kill this one. The market is in need of a solid MMO, all you have to do is fix the damn bugs and optimize the damn game. Having to resort to Google for fixes is not something everyone willing do to make their game playable. All in all, I definitely see the potential for this one to become a big title in the near future.

Bless does have potential, burried deep down.
Tho after playing it, I have a hard time believing it can be brought out.

There are core problems, that have not been fixed, that where known from releases in other areas/countries.

[olist]
    [*]Combat/Animation issues: Skill chains just don't feel or look good. It feels really clunky and stiff. Every single time, it takes a bit to go from skill A to skill B and skill C in the chain.
    [*]Keybinds: You can not change them, and they are pretty bad. Now I can deal with flying over the keyboard to use a certain skill. While a game should be made ""your own"" so you can play and enjoy it how you like, it appears to have removed it somewhere between the Emisary live streams and the release.
    [*]Mouse control: The mouse control, really killed the game for me. I enjoy games, where the mouse is fluid and you can move left to right with your screen without a problem.
Then there's Bless, you have to click your mouse button and then your screen will go crazy fast, even with the sensitivity on really low. This actually made me nauseous and I prefer to stay away from that.
    [*]Graphic controls/settings/optimizing: Now I understand that UE3 is old, and I know optimization is bad. But my god, it's bad. I played Tera for quite a while and that went better then this..
    [*]UI: You can not, resize, remove, replace your UI. It's MASSIVE, it's not gonna do what you want it to do. Its gonna stay there, and be annoying.

Get the feedback and do the things they are asking: mainly fixing bugs that should have been fixed before even Beta launch, optimization, etc. Even the small things that I see people complaining about (like bad translations, sub titles in the cut scenes not being exactly to what was being said etc) because even fixing the small things will give people less things to complain about with your game. 

I know you are working really hard to make this a success, as you do not want it to flop like the other regions, but I feel in order to do that you should have waited longer and got more things fixed and polished before launching. I believe the artwork and world is beautiful in my opinion. I have a computer that can handle the graphics without it lagging too much but with my rig, it shouldn't lag at all. Fix that: don't just assume that people with not the most up to date graphics card will just lower their settings to make it work better, have that as the norm. Fix the fps issue as well, it would make fighting better. I overall enjoy the camera and movements, once I got the hang of it, it was easy to get into the flow. So keep that, but just listen to the feedback. It may all seem like shit, which is why I am commenting, because overall for being a beta game (ignore the fact that it was released in other regions - I am treating this as a completely new game) I feel it is pretty decent. And one I will continue to watch for updates and hope within the coming months that lots of changes happen so that I can purchase the game again.

a note from the official team and stickied in there sub section yet steam do not want to refund the game.

take what im saying with a grain of salt as there are parts of this game i like and parts that i dislike
i dont really want to go fully in depth as alot of people already have and i feel that there is alot of backlash on this.

this game is not bad, but it is not worth the investment at this time. 
i would love to be able to refund it now and keep an eye on it for the near future. 

i love mmo games but i cant justify the $250NZD i put down on it for the amount i will play it.
now i know that is my own fault for putting that much foward but the fact i cant refund after the expereince is upsetting.

before you get into the details of i have played over 2 hours so policy is strict. i have plenty of friends and players i know with anywhere from 10 - 20+ hours in the game and there refunds were approved within an hour. so i dont understand why i am having such a push back from steam.

the combat system is this game is really good in my opinion but balance should be a focus along with the economy game breaker that is duplication of items. all im seeing in chat is trade spam selling high level duped goods and its honestly just an eye sore.

i know exploits will be fixed but the backlash of what it causes wont be for a long time.

i jump from mmo to mmo alot with around 2k hours on ffxiv and around 12k in wow i wasnt looking for a wow killer i was just looking for a new experience and in my opinion this didnt provide. i have friends that love it and thats cool in the future i may want to come back but unless your ready to stick it out with a more of an investment for an mmo rather than a full game i suggest this otherwise stay clear.

Sure the game can use improved optimization can be improved, luckily we have a good community that finds ways to improve these things. 

Gameplay has been really fun, I am mainly here to PvP(Think most of us do) and that has been delivered. I can't wait to see what the theorycrafters and testers come up with builds with this combo system. 

The only thing I was not aware of is was the missing content, but that gives new players time to get accustomed to the game and it should be delivered within a few weeks. 

Regardless what people say, if I compare this to any other MMO launch, where queue's were way bigger, downtime was a lot longer and unexpected, Neowiz has been on point with server resets and gave us a compensation that does not come close to anything else I have received as compensation before. 

Quick tip if you want to avoid big queue's at the end of the day before coming home to work, what I do is log in via teamviewer and launch the game, so that when I get home I can continue my journey.

- Decent graphics for an Unreal Engine 3 game. 
- Great character customization. Can make very nice waifus to fit any taste. Probably the best MMO one out there currently.
- The gear looks pretty great and fits the setting. 
- Combat is pretty fun although I haven't unlocked all my character's stances yet. 
- Voiceovers and non-battle music are good for a MMO.
- No blatant P2W though it's early days still.
- Taming system is pretty fantastic although it has worrying hints of potential P2W with how it's designed.

So-So:
- Class balance seems quite wonky. Mage is just a better Ranger. Guardian is extremely strong.
- Not much cash shop stuff. I know this sounds weird but I wouldn't mind getting a costume or something but there's really not much there considering this game has years of backlog content.
- It's a generic MMO. Doesn't do much to improve upon the formula. If this was a breakfast it'd be porridge with no flavouring. Pretty filling but bland-ish.

Cons:
- Translation is worse than something a single fan could make. Ability descriptions make no sense. Oddly the main quest's translation is really good, it's just the skills and the tutorial that are the worst... you know, the stuff people actually read.
- Launch had lots of issues but seems fixed now.
- Developers don't really seem to know what they're doing. Lacking PR and seemingly no good english-korean translator works for them since all their PR material is chinese electronics instruction manual tier.
- Optimization is utterly garbage but I managed to get it to run around 70fps outside of main cities (980ti-3gb/i7-4790k/8gb RAM).
- Battle music is really repetitive and can't be turned off. It's like a 3 second loop. AAAAAAAARGH.

Overall I give it a 7.5/10. It's decent but nothing special. If it had came out in the heyday of UE3 (2012) when TERA came out, it could have been the best around. Nowadays it just feels dated. I will change this to recommended if they work out the issues above and keep the game from being P2W.

Overall, after just under three hours with the game myself, I think the game is fun. 
The combat *feels* really good, and impactful.
The world design is great, even if the texture quality and some meshses are a bit dated.

Worst game ever.

1. It's Monetization is fair, I can't reccomend enough for this reason. They didn't go P2W and I respect that.
2. For an Eastern Game, they are listening to the NA and EU markets for feedback and correcting mistakes quickly.
3. Neowiz is self-publishing, meaning they will hopefully make the best decisions for their game, not the publisher's bottom line.
4. They seamlessly mix PvP and PvE - It's a PvP game, but doing well in PvE will help you in the PvP aspect. PvE gear is the PvP gear. Both types of content help to progress you and it's been awhile since a game has done this well.
5. The new combat system they designed for this specific release is a success to me. I find there to be a great deal of customization and fluid gamelay with the new system.
6. It's a traditional MMO. It's the best Traditional MMO experience i've had levels 1-20 so far, we shall see what I think ahead but right now it's very good.

Cons: Every game has them

1. Optimization could use some work, there is a .ini fix but obviosly shouldn't need to do this.
2. Content is a bit slim, but I still believe it's worth the entry price.

Pros :

- Combat system - playing as a mage is really fun.  Casting magic takes time and you really feel that your character needs to build up power to cast powerful magic.

- Graphics - Amazing 4K graphics using fullscreen borderless mode.  The game use DX9 and it is a bit tricky sometimes.  But sti amazing graphics for that graphic engine.  Hopefully devs will be able.to shift to DX11 or DX12

Cons : 

- Early Access - This is not an Early Access technically. But the game could have been more polished at release.  This is not normal to get sub 30FPS with a 1080Ti and ryzen.

Thoughts:

People complaining about paying to access dungeons.  This is to be teleport to the dungeon if you are too lazy to find it yourself.  You do not need to farm any money in the game and this is not a pay to win.  Just some help for lazy people with deep pocket.

Sinon pour ma part je n'ai pas connu ce jeu sur la version jap, j'attendais qu'elle arrive en France, donc pour moi ça reste de la découverte :)
Pour l'instant je ne suis qu'au niveau 10/12. Pour le moment niveau gameplay j'avais plus accroché avec celui de BDO qui était un peu plus ""nerveux"" à mon avis, mais bon, ce n'est que le début donc je continue à jouer pour voir au plus haut lvl. Je regrette qu'il n'y ait pas le système d'esquive du genre ou on appuie deux fois sur le déplacement et on se jette au sol mais bon ça c'est un gout personnel :)
Le jeu possède actuellement 5 classes [ gardien (le tank), paladin (le heal) berserker (dps, apparement gros bourrin d'après ce que j'ai pu entendre dans le discord), mage, et archer] L""assassin , mystique et sorcier qui arriveront surement par la suite , on les voit sur la création de personnage. Je crois que le tank et le heal possède une spé dps mais honnêtement je n'en suis pas sur.
J'ai un peu regarder les arbres de ""talent"" avec trois onglet. Malheureusement le jeu étant anglais ce n'est pas forcément évident mais bon on s'adapte. Ils m'ont l'air d'avoir pas mal de chose à faire. J'ai pu voir (si j'ai bien compris^^) sur le premier onglet qu'on pouvait avoir 6 ""postures"" différente, et que chaque posture on avait un buff particulier. Chaque posture possède ses propres sorts qui fonctionnent en combo. Dans chaque posture on peut voir 3 sorts de base qui peuvent chacun enclencher trois combo différent. Ces sort sont sur les touches 1.2.3 et quand vous enclenchez un de ces sort, le jeu vous propose de les enchainer avec les combo par V,T et R (pour le peu que j'ai pu voir). Ensuite il y a un autre onglet avec des sorts qu'on peut utiliser seul, je dirais que c'est des buff/protection (genre un bouclier, des ressources de classes etc...) et un dernier onglet auquel je n'ai pas encore accès, mais je suppose que ce sont des talents passif.
Les graphismes ne me dérange pas plus que ça, j'ai vu plus beau mais aussi plus laid^^ pour ma part c'est correct.
Ils ont mis un système de capture de monstre, à priori on peut capturer tous les monstres du jeu sauf les boss, par un système très simple.(et ils deviennent soit une monture soit un pet) Il suffit d'avoir un parchemin (les plus haut lvl se craft par l'enchantement) et de l'enclencher à coté du monstre voulu, et un mini-jeu s'enclenche où il faut appuyer sur espace quand une barre qui bouge de gauche à droite se trouve dans la couleur bleue. Après je suis trop bas lvl, mais apparemment on peut les améliorer pour bénéficier de différents buff suivant les monstres.
Le jeu possède aussi des métiers (je n'y ai pas encore eu accès) mais j'ai pu entendre par ma guilde qu'il y avait un peu de tout. Enchantement, cuisine, alchimiste etc, les métiers qu'on peut voir dans les mmo en général.
Perso j'ai pu commencer la récolte, Je n'aime pas trop le fait qu'il faille acheter les items qui ne sont utilisable qu'une seule fois, j'aurai préférer limite des outils avec durabilité mais bon ce n'est qu'un détail.
Pour moi, ne connaissant pas le jeu japonais, ça reste une découverte où je pourrais passer quelques heures dessus pendant quelques mois, surtout qu'ils ont prévu de faire des rajouts tous les trois mois ( d'ici 15 jours ils ont prévu de mettre un 15v15 , du donjon pve et d'autres choses non précisé)",True,1527759298,1527760185,True,0,0,0.433071,True

I used the one on reddit. Takes like 10mins to do and it really optimizes the game.

The worst things about the game so far to me are the not so stellar translations of quests or the skill tree, the awful map, and the default key bindings are really awkward. Other than that I actually really like the game and its really functional for an Early Access game. Neowiz has already addressed multiple issues and its only day 2 of the launch.

This is less of a Review than an Info regarding an Bless.
There are more than enough Reviews that tell u the Pros and Cons atm.

But i clearly think the game is on a good way and has MASSIVE Potential.

My Point is, yes Bless had big Problems with Servers and other things and still has, but
in many ways, less of them, than many other popular MMOs when they launched,
which many People seem to have forget or don't know of.

If GW2, FFXIV, BDO or any other MMO launched on Steam, their Reviews would've been
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO BAD for the first Weeks its unbelievable.

You'll see the Reviews climb in the next 1-2 Weeks when they release the first big Content Patch and
fix all the major Problems, The Devs are working 24/7 to fix everything and give a lot of Info on what they're
doing.

So don't be afraid of bad Reviews, buy the game ,try it out and if you don't like it you can REFUND even
with more than 2h Playtime, so you can at least give it a shot without losing any money.

Hope this helped you a little, cya

I wasn't going to actually make a review for this game, but I keep seeing a lot of people giving it a bad name and spreading around false information about the game. You might see people saying this game ""Failed"" multiple times. That is a lie. This game has never made it outside of Beta in any region. It was being tested and they have changed so much on the game since the tests. The game is out in Japan and has a pretty good following. Don't let the few Cons take away from the Pros. I am going to go through some Pro's and Con's and then talk about the game a little bit. 
______________________________________________________________________________________

Pros-
-Enjoyable combat(It feels to me like how Neverwinter's combat was, but this is a little bit faster pace) 
-Party Questing in this game actually feels like you're working towards the quest unlike other games(looking at you WoW) 
-The Open World is huge and you can go to any part of it! (Some parts you can get attacked in) 
-Open World PvP ^ (The zones you can get attacked in!!) 
-HUGE skill/stat trees(This game uses the old school Str,Agi,Wis... stats even has an accuracy stat!)
-You can literally tame and ride almost anything!(You can tame a Dragon/Demon with a mace...LOL)
-Insane Character Customization!(It took me an hour just to go through all the options and changes)
-NOT PTW!( I can't stress, this game is a buy and then (optional)subscription) The game has no PTW elements and anything you can buy with IRL money you can make in game and/or currency exchange and buy. 
-Very enjoyable scenery(The game on max settings is amazing and even on lowest settings still will for sure amaze you) You will have some FPS problems, but I normalize about 73 fps on max settings and all I have is a 1060 3GB

It wouldn't be a true review if I didn't give you the cons...

Cons-
-Game was released a little bit too early I think and we were promised a lot, but it's only been 2 days. So I think people are just not very patient.
-End Game content. There is not a ton of end game dungeons or raids to do, but the crafting sytem/gathering system can provide a pretty good way to keep you busy while we wait for updates.
-Suffers huge optimization issues for how long it's been in development 
-More engaging questing experience(The main story is the best part of the leveling to max(still is not an amazing story, but it's a story I guess...))
-They need to fire their translator. The in-game ""english"" is extremely broken and sometimes impossible to understand. There are mispelled words and huge typos.
____________________________________________________________________________________

All in all I think the Pro's outweight the Con's. I think this game is a wonderful game and I plan to put in plenty of hours and continue my subscription. I really hope that Neowiz can see this review because I really hope they keep this game open! I think if people just give them a chance to continue working their game and stop trying to bash them on every forum, it would allow a wider variety of gamers to give the game a chance. People are killing the game in only 2 days of ""early access"" release. I personally love the game and don't plan on playing much of anything else for a while. I just hope you give the game a fighting chance and look past the ""8 hour"" reviews and push through those first 5-10 hours of learning the combat and how the game works. 

Thank you, Bless Online and Thank you NeoWiz!

TL:DR- The game has an Open World with PvP/PvE elements, a vast skill tree and an array of abilties to fight with. Multiple classes along with multiple races make the variety rival that of major titles. I recommend this game!

Jetzt gibt es auch von mir eine böse Ansage -,-
Mal ehrlich.. ist es sooo schwer zu Beginn einfach mal die Server richtig aufzuteilen und offizielle Deutsche, Französische usw. Server zu erstellen ? Damit es nicht zu Missverständnissen bei der Serverwahl kommt ?
So. Meine Spielkollegen spielen nun auf Daimon - Union. Ich bin nicht drauf gekommen. Server gespert. Darf nun alleine spielen.. danke sehr -,-
Hätte man die Server zu Beginn einfach eingeteilt... hätte es solche Probleme vermutliche erst gar nicht gegeben.
Andere Spiele haben es vorgemacht. Warum hält man sich nicht einfach an deren Beispiel und Erfahrung zum EU Release. Ist ja nach all den Jahren MMO Dasein keine Neuheit mehr.

Zudem ist mir negativ aufgefallen: Keine Vorschaufunktion für Equip - Keine deutsche Schriftausgabe - Ein Chatfilter der sich nicht ausschalten lässt - Sehr begrenzte Zeichenauswahl im Chat. Quasi mangelnde Grundfunktionen in einem Spiel das extra verschoben wurde um an den EU Markt angepasst zu werden. 
Und was bekommt man als Käufer von einem 40 / 70 /  oder gar 150 Euro Paket ! Unausgegorene Scheiße ! -,-   Sorry das ich das mal so sagen muss.. aber bin echt sauer...
Ich frage mich zudem auch was nun mit den neu dazu gekommenen Servern werden soll ? Gibt es dann zukünftig kostenlose ! Serverwechsel ?!
Wie stellen die sich das denn vor ? Wollen die dann alle wieder zusammen legen ? Was passiert denn dann mit meinen Chars wenn ich die hochspiele ? Auf dem falschen Server ? Macht das überhaupt noch Sinn ?

Ich hab kein Problem mit Serverlaggs.. und Funktions und Verbindungsproblemen in den ersten Tagen. Das ist ganz normal und verständlich.

I like this game but i cannot recomend it, at least not yet.

Pros: 
Good Combat Feel
Good animations, (i only played the Mage Class)
Ok voice acting for the story(bad sound quality tho,
i could hear the static)

Cons: 
The interface is bad, like really bad, you can't change anything about it.
The controls are restricting 
The Camera is HORRIBLE 
Optimization is bad
other things that i can't remember

It's not p2w (thank cheese) and has very pretty graphics.
Expensive, sure. But its totally worth it. As someone who bought the founder's pack, i can safely say this game is worth putting your money on. Cash shop mostly has cosmetics and some minor 'help items' (nothing to give you an advantage though). 
It is quite difficult to other MMOs but nothing impossible. It takes a while to lvl up as the max lvl isn't too high. 
Its got furries, lolis, shotas, elves, humans and possibly eventually a siren race too.
We all await the Warlock class though ;-;
Its producers (makers? team?) cares a lot for this game and will not allow it to become p2w as it would have only about 10-15 people playing (rich people i guess) who would eventually quit due to no other players.

Une fois en jeu, le tutoriel est relativement complet, mais la mauvaise traduction du jeu risque de vous ralentir un peu sur certaines étapes. Une fois la zone tutoriel terminé, vous aurez la chance de débuter le story mode qui est, pour l'instant, intégralement doublé en anglais. Quelques vidéo par-ci, quelques cinématique par la ""via game engine"". Vous allez débarquer dans la capitale de vôtre faction.  ***TRÈS IMPORTANT, le choix de l'alliance choisi sera défini pour tout les personnages du serveur*** C'est ainsi le temps de faire un peu de social et de discuter et faire des duels avec d'autres joueurs ""achivement incoming!"". 

Pour l'instant, je n'ai pas poussé plus loin in-game car j'étudiais l'interface. Beaucoup de mapping à faire pour les touches, un auto-run extraordinaire ""à double tranchant"", peu d'ajustement possible pour optimiser votre jeu ""low FPS malgré 1070ti à certains moment"" et un cash shop qui est loin de s'enligner vers un P2W for heureusement.

Let's start with the actual flaws
-Localisation is bad. Not terribly bad, but it sometimes makes you think for longer when reading description of a skill. If the game is released for a western audience, this should've been done better
-Default config is not optimised. There's an easy fix to get decent fps on reddit, but the idea that you need to do that and it's not done by default isnt pleasing
-Overly agressive profanity filter. I wanted to name my guild Beavers. I couldnt. Beaver is bad word. Dont let your kids call anyone a beaver.

3v3 seems fair, so here's 3 pro's aswell

+Management - Hats off to Neowiz for dealing with community these last two days. It was a rough launch, but they stayed on top of things and everything is just getting better. More servers, no queues. Splash screen bug has been fixed, with class balance patch and various quality of life improvements coming in shorty.
+Mechanics - Overwhelming at first, you discover how much there is to do. Of course you can join the hate bandwagon, spam dungeon till 45 and cry there's no endgame while you've just barely scratched the suface of the possibilities of this game.
+Visuals - Game looks awesome both in combat and environment wise. Nothing seems forced or out of place. Naturally there are frame drops in the most populated spots, but lets be real, which game doesnt. Most of the haters who bash fps rates in the cities, jizz themselves while getting 20fps in pubg lobby.

Overall, yes there are flaws, but it's early days. And i would definitely not be the one to try to my youtube subscribers about lack of endgame if i had just reached lvl 33 out of 45. But hey, bandwagoning on the hate train is fine.

TL;DR - My suggestion is give this game a try. Maybe not now, if you dont feel safe. It's still first days of the launch, it can be bad at times. But the games has what it takes to become one of the bigges mmo's out there. Either get it now, or wait - it's up to you.

It's really frustrating that they had an early founder's release. This just meant that it costs everyone that was hopeful more money than others that waited two days.

The translation is subpar, at best. I don't mind it, but it could frustrate a lot of people. It actually makes quests almost impassable, if you're not the inquisitive type

Also, the two days that most were allowed ahead of time was riddled with completely unstable servers and pretty much non-access.

I was really looking foward to this being an opportunity to get back into MMOs. C'est la vie.

Just like every other franchise, people are all too quick to jump on the ""Fuck this game omg"" bandwagon.

If you sat down, went through the .ini fixes and used even a slither of your brain, you'd find that this game, while it has its flaws, has some easy fixes around the optimisation problems.

Now. The gameplay.
It's friggen amazing. The combo system brings an entire new element to the difficulty of this game, and Neowiz should be praised for bringing a better, more fluent system to the Western Regions of gaming.

Like Pokemon? You'll looooove Bless. Tame every fucking thing in sight. Ride it, use it for buffs, send that bastard out to gather 'erbs. It's another fun aspect of the game, that these salty dweebs have forgotten, because they've spent 1 hour in the game, and 55minutes of that was spent whinging on the Facebook page, instead of looking to Reddit, where all the juicy fixes are.

The game required serious modification to the ini and other files to even boot past load screen.

It somehow is both ugly, and runs worse than any other game I have played.

Laggy with severe server stability issues - sometimes kicking you out and putting you back into a 1+ hour que.

The entire game is written in ""Engrish"" half Japanese, half Korean, and half English. You get tooltips that are simply nonfunctional like you would see in an early alpha version like ""game asset attack_3"" or tooltips that are so poorly written that it is impossible even guess at what it means - most famously the item that read ""Decreases the cooldown cooldown, but Increases the cooldown cooldown"".

Minor bugs like Players stuck in the 3D model view pose (arms out) flying around in the sky. Mobs standing in place and performing AoE attacks without trying to react to players, Autorun ramming you head first into walls or off cliffs. 

Major bugs like loot drops phasing out of your ""channel"" and being unlootable, bosses instantly respawning after being killed and dropping no loot, abilities and passives not functioning correctly or some times at all, quests even in the tutorial being unable to be completed. 

Game balance is nonexistant. Players were running around 1 shotting each otherer in PvP and Soloing dungeons and elite mobs they were not supposed to. The Devs response? Nerf player damage by 80%+ and increase all health pools - making killing even single mobs a chore, and killing high end boss mobs sometimes impossible. In PvP healing classes are able to tank damage from 5+ players without even flinching.

Class balance is nonexistant - skill 1 may do 2 to 3 times the damage of skill 2, in a short time frame and for less resource essentially making skill 2 either wholly obsolete or just a noob trap. The worst case example of this is that one classes entire rotation in both PvE and PvP is just spamming one button over and over, in both early and end game levels (this is not an exaggeration). When sampling the characters I saw that the level 1 Tank class in the tutorial was able to get bigger critcal hits than my level 15 ranger.

ZERO customer service - if you submit a ticket don't expect anyone to ever respond.

Player skills are boring - they all look very flashy and fun, but functionally under the hood they are drier than in Vanilla WoW.

The game is a GRIND. Good god its a grind to level, a grind to gear, and grind to gather, a grind to craft, a grind to upgrade, even a grind for pets and mounts all with heavy RNG elements added in to prolong the process.

PvP is locked and only available several hours a day.

Cash shop options are not fully P2W, but are more intrusive than they should be - in particular in a game with a full retail price tag. The cash shop mostly bypasses frustrating elements of the game - but those frustrating elements were clearly put in place only to make the cash shop / membership more appealing. The devs essentially created a bad experience in game, then offer you the chance to pay them to avoid it.

TLDR: It is ugly, slow, buggy and boring, and simply not fun, total complete garbage.

This game offers MANY things most mmo's do and more with great PVP concepts aswell. So far i'm satisfied and currently enjoying all i've done. 

 As of the 28th you could buy this game for early access for a small fee of $10 extra, a total of $40 unless you wanted the exspensive packs for some reason. So, lots of people massively logging in the game at the same time BEFORE the actual launch (Early Access 2Days Prior) caused and revealed some issues which have been fixed or are being worked on. Which is exspected nobodys perfect, but was needed to fine tune and have a proper ready game for actual release on the 30th. This is thousands and thousands of people from all over the world going on your game.. only so much you can test, until the actual moment.. and after fix were its needed. 

This all being said there's too many self entitled little cry babies soley judging the game upon this early access which is absurd. The steam community is absolutely terrible when it comes reviews and its quite sad. I've literally seen bad reviews because people couldnt launch a game on steam or they got a blue screen.. come to find out those idiots didnt even buy the game yet or simply didnt adjust there cable into there monitor.. Yes, this is the community they'll hate for any reason and yes they're never wrong.. smh..

I  got on today after work and was able to immediately log in and play my toon with my friend with no issues :)

Pros:
1) Amazing animations
2) Farming mobs is actually fun! (hunting log is a great addition and makes it enjoyable to farm mobs with your buddies)
3) Dungeons are neat :)
4) I haven't tried pvp yet, but if it is anything like the pve, I will be happy :)
5) Lots of ways to get xp and level (questing, dungeons, hunting log, etc...)
6) You can tame pretty much anything in the game and have it as a mount or companion :)

Most of the negative reviews are just people's experiences with the immediate launch,
1) Splash screen (this was due to a steam to bless authentication issue)
2) Item duping (They are already working on a fix and mentioned that they will take action against the abusers and take back ingame currency).
3) Server lag on quests and items, they have upgraded their equipment to handle the IO requests to the database
4) FPS, most likely servers were overloaded and with the bugs above, etc... today had very manageable fps 80-130+ (especially for a early access MMO with a rediculous amount of players online in the same locations)
5) Lack of endgame content, it is early access, they have redesigned core functionality in the game which most likely broke the endgame content or made it unplayable/unenjoyable. It makes sense if they are trying to optimize, to make the content enjoyable and solid.
5.1) People complaining: Lack of content, most people are just speeding through the content spamming dungeons to level to max in a single day. Then they start complaining that there is nothing to do, meanwhile there are plenty of fun quests, pvp, taming, hunt logs, gathering and other activities that if done while leveling and at max level would immerse a player and make them enjoy the game more.


TLDR: The game is fun, 90% of the angry comments are problems that have or will be fixed, Neowiz is quickly addressing the problems, if they keep up the efforts many more people will be playing this game in the future :)

I personally will play this game and possibly ESO summerset until Warcraft BFA comes out, and will probably hop back on this to check on it whenever there is a dry spell on Warcraft :)

For one, the taming is very addicting. Yes I wish you could do a bit more with it but I still like doing it. And being able to make the scrolls yourself is pretty freaking nice. 2nd day in and I made 100 High Level taming scrolls. Worth.

Two, The cinematics are super nice, and I LOVE the transport system. Instead of a loading screen you get an amazingly beautiful scene of flight or a boat ride. It's great.

The dungeons can be a bit annoying if you dont have a good party or people that will cooperate. Though you can solo some of them easily enough. 

The open world PVP is a bit of a turn off for me, but it can be fun. Im not a fan of the body campers that wait for you to revive to kill you instantly or the people that wait for people at dungeons and slaughter them in groups of 15. But you can change channel to avoid this usually.

Seriously unless a game is steam exclusive I am not buying on this platform anymore.

- Yes, BLESS Online is EA (Early Access)
- There are obvious bugs in the game and some optimization issues present but its not UNPLAYABLE
- The Dev's at BLESS are constantly working with us and are improving it everyday to give us qualilty that we want to see/have.
- The voice over is pretty bad and hope they rework this in the future 
- Character creation is very in depth and it's great for players who like to make their character the way they envisioned him/her to be.
- Combat is great; however, stance switching needs to be more fluid as there is a delay into swapping and chaining combos together.
- Graphics is amazing and is true to a 2018 MMO
- Buy to Play with optional sub if you want more goodies.

With that said I do recommend this game if you have patience with its development. I also brought the Collectors Edition and am a Founder. Alot of people have said this game launch was the worse thing they ever had happen to them, and me coming from other MMOS this is honestly one of the better launches I've ever seen. 

I will say the most Con there is, if you decide to teleport to a dungeon, then you will have to use your currency Lumena. So, at present I don't suggest using DF (Dungeon Finder, Duty Finder) at this time and you should just go to the dungeon on foot.

So besides that and to wrap that up, I do honestly suggest you give this a look :)",True,1527745825,1527813883,True,5,11,0.407715,True

It has performance issue YES--BUT! it's still very manageable and personally? I don't feel that it is life-threatening. The taming is super fun and it's kinda cool to ride on a giant scorpion one day and the other riding a wolf! 

PRO's

-It has a great story! which every race have its own beginning which gives a lot of replay values for multiple characters
-The Taming system is nice--anything to everything can become a mount or a pet!
-The graphics? while being a little outdated still hold up and the world looks beautiful
-The classes are diverse and feel very different from most parts. 
-The armor design is amazing! details and finely crafted look for each. 
-The PVE content overall is nice and welcomed after so many online games right now only offering a brief story and more PVP
- The dungeons are cool---very different layouts and design. 

CON's

-Optimization not being super perfect but its tolerable for now.
- Some of the translation are awful I admit and it needs to be reworded or simply remade. 
-The lack of a dye system to make me look super special is no-existing
-clunky mechanics or mostly weird chain-skills 
- Lack of IBLIS being a playable character >.>

0,148,1,1409,1409,76561198001479049,0,german,False,42398302,"Nach jetzt ca. 13 Stunden Spielzeit (Level 24) möchte ich auch ein paar Worte zu Bless Online abgeben um den negativen Reviews, welche teilweise ohne Substanz hier abgegeben wurden, entgegenzuwirken. 

Allerdings muss ich den vielen negativen Stimmen leider erst einmal zustimmen. Der Headstart war eine Katastrophe! Das muss man nicht schön reden oder seine Optimismus-Rute schwingen. Serverlags, Warteschlangen, Bugs, Serverwartung etc. NEOWIZ hat sich hier massiv verkalkuliert. Und um ehrlich zu sein, hätte ich das auch! Wenn man sich die Stimmung vor dem Headstart in den Bless Foren oder den Kommentaren etablierter Spielemagazine anschaut, war die Meinung über das Spiel von vorneherein sehr negativ geprägt. Es wurde viel über die Kombination von Buy2Play, Itemshop und Premium gemotzt. Ständig wurde Pay2Win durch die Hallen des Kommentarbereichs geschrien und absolut alles verurteilt. Bei so einer negativen öffentlichen Meinung wäre ich als Entwickler vielleicht auch erstmal die sichere Schiene gefahren um nicht gleich alle Ressourcen auf einmal ins Feld zu werfen. Das kann man allerdings auch sehr kontrovers betrachten, was in Anbetracht dessen sinnvoller gewesen wäre.

Bei all den Problemen, welche NEOWIZ jetzt zum Headstart hatte, darf man auch einfach das Gesamtbild nie aus den Augen lassen: Early Access, Headstart, Entwickler- und Publisher. 

- Ein Spiel, welches im Early Access gestartet wird ist nunmal nicht fertig und möchte mit der Hilfe und dem Feedback der Spieler verbessert und geformt werden. Das ist der Grundgedanke des EA und wird es auch immer sein. Wer ein Spiel im EA unterstützt und spielt muss nunmal mit Bugs, Serverlags und Problemen zum Start rechnen. Ganz besonders im Hinblick auf ein MMO. UND da macht es auch keinen Unterschied, ob das Spiel schon seit einigen Jahren in anderen Ländern existiert. 

- Neowiz ist nicht nur Entwickler, sondern gleichzeitig auch Publisher auf dem westlichen Markt, nachdem Aeria abgesprungen ist. Aeria Games ist ein im Westen etablierter Publisher, welcher genügend Erfahrungswerte im MMO-Genre auf dem westlichen Markt mitbringt. Sowas kann man einfach nicht so schnell kompensieren oder kopieren. 
Meiner Meinung nach hat hier NEOWIZ als Publisher eine Mammut-Aufgabe vollbracht!

- Ja. Der Headstart. Wenn man sich alle Faktoren mal objektiv anschaut, dann ist vermutlich vielen von Anfang an klar gewesen, dass dieser Headstart auch gleichzeitig ein Stresstest war. Ich habe mit Problemen in jeglicher Form gerechnet. Es war natürlich nicht schön, aber ich habe mir das Founder's Pack auch nicht unbedingt wegen den 2 Tagen früher zocken gekauft, sondern wegen den Inhalten. Da werden die Meinungen jetzt klar auseinander gehen, aber wenn sich jemand für 150 Euro, die Collector's Edition kauft und dann gleich wieder erstattet, weil er den Headstart nicht (gut) spielen kann. Joa. Dann würde ich mir mal Gedanken über das Thema Early Access machen und grundlegend die Finger von Vorbestellungen lassen. 

Und jetzt nach dem gestrigen Early Access Start kann man eigentlich vor den Entwicklern nur den Hut ziehen. Es wurde absolut alles Offen kommuniziert. Man hat sich gestern öffentlich bei allen Foundern entschuldigt und Sie über alles aufgeklärt. Die Server waren gestern Abend nach dem Start absolut stabil. Die schwierigen Problempunkte wurden behoben. Und jeder bekommt noch 2450 Lumina als Aufwandsentschädigung! Das entspricht auch gleich mal 18 Euro. Sowas ist sehr lobenswert von den Entwicklern! 

-------------------------------------------

Jetzt aber mal zum Gameplay. 

Ich bin als Paladin auf Daimon unterwegs und es macht wirklich Laune. Das Kampfsystem ist trotz Tab-Targeting sehr gut umgesetzt. Die Chain-Skills ermöglichen verschiedenste Spielweisen und können durch die Tactic-Wechsel nochmal an Tiefe zunehmen. Momentan sind leider noch die Schadens- und Heilzahlen zu unbalanced, was aber von Neowiz in den kommenden 2 Wochen behoben werden soll. Die einzelnen Skills können nochmal in 2 verschiedenen Wegen upgegradet werden. (5 % mehr DMG für diese Fähigkeit etc.). Das gilt auch für die normalen Skills und es kommt noch ein kleiner ""Talentbaum"" dazu, welchen man auf 4 verschiedenen Wegen füllen kann.

Der Grind ist der Inhalt, welcher mich zu Anfangs am Meisten abgeschreckt hatte, aber ich bin sehr positiv überrascht. Der Grind (Huntquests) fühlt sich durch die kleinen Etappenziele (Step 1: Töte 8 Mobs - 700 EXP, Step 2: Töte 20 Mobs, 700 EXP etc.) sehr motivierend und überhaupt nicht langatmig an. Fast jeder Mob hat eine eigene Huntquest-Reihe, damit man auch abseits der Quests noch einiges an EXP sammeln kann.

Die Quests sind standardkost. Ich bin kein Lore-Fanatiker, deswegen kann ich da leider nicht zu sehr ins Detail gehen. Sie spielen sich wie in anderen MMO's eigentlich ziemlich gleich ab. (Killquests, Sammelquests etc.). Die Quests sind in 5 verschiedene Kategorien unterteilt. 

1. Hauptquests 
2. Nebenquests 
3. Tutorialquests 
4. Huntquests
5. Royalquests (Erst ab Stufe 45 freigeschaltet)

Bei den Tutorialquests werden die Grundfunktionen dem Spieler näher gebracht. Diese laufen aber simultan zu den Haupt- und Nebenquests und werden dann auch im gleichen Zug abgeschlossen.

Das Interface ist eigentlich ganz übersichtlich, aber mir wären noch mehr Details ganz lieb gewesen. 

Was mir bisher noch sauer aufstößt, ist das nicht unterstützte 21:9 Ultra WideScreen Format. Also im Jahr 2018 erwarte ich eigentlich, dass ein Spiel jegliche Auflösungen von Anfang an unterstützt!

Dann kommt noch die nicht vorhandene deutsche Übersetzung, welche von Neowiz eigentlich zum EA Release angekündigt wurde. Allerdings werden Sie diese zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt wohl noch nachreichen.


[b] Zum Abschluss kann man eigentlich nur sagen, dass Bless Online wieder ein klassisches MMO mit Potential ist. So wie jedes andere Spiel zur Anfangsphase hat es mit Problemen zu kämpfen und muss sich auch erstmal etablieren. Doch ich sehe eine positive Zukunft, solange Neowiz offen mit den Spielern kommuniziert und regelmäßig neue Inhalte nachreicht! [/b]

0,173,2,4969,4969,76561198018553893,0,english,False,42398281,"Firstly; apparently most of the negative reviewers didn't read the FINE PRINT  - Note: This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further. If you are not excited to play this game in its current state, then you should wait to see if the game progresses further in development - ITS NOT COMPLETE....Don't write your waste of space review about it not being complete, when it's right there stating its not complete.


Based off of only 40 hours of game play so far - I like this game alot.  I have hopes for where it might go, given the devs are the ones loading it to steam and not a 3rd party middle man, peddling for some pay to win model.

I have read some of these negative reviews...most ""points"" are laughable....some are legit.  Here is my list of Pros/Cons.

Pros:
 - Fresh(ish) MMO at least for NA/EU, I know its ported over, will adress cons associated with this below.
 - Interesting character build system: I like the depth of the combat builds, and I know they aren't all in the game yet, as 
    most of the negative reviewers cry bout not having end game content 2 days after head start on an early access goes 
    live.
- Beautiful environments: the biome tiles (yea tiles, open that map and look at the almost perfect squares through all the 
   regions and you can see how the map is pieced together) are pretty well done, texture wise - it looks nice.
- Music - I am not one for in game music most of the time, I usually turn it way down or off, but the sound track in this 
   game is amazing.
- Developer is trying very hard to avoid having anything be pay 2 win.

Cons: 
- Video support only lists 1080p as highest resolution option, and if you play windowed/windowed full screen on an 
   ultrawide, you have to manually tweak one of the .ini files to fix the anchor point for the camera to the Y axis vs the X 
   axis in order to fix FoV skewing and where on the screen your character is displayed - I list this as a con because - it 
   should be right to begin with....but after fixing it myself, the game looks amazing and my character is mid screen like it 
   should be ala WoW style.

- Localization: Man....those translations need some work, there are instances of skills/quests that still need to be properly 
   translated to avoid confusion, or offer a clearer explanation of what is going on.

That being said, there have been issues with server stability, and availability that comes from basically having 0 market data for how many mouths they were going to have to feed.  Initial report was 1 mega server for NA and EU, but there were far more people wanting this game than they knew, which could have been avoided but Steam didn't allow them to offer pre load/pre sale on packages.

While the voice acting is some of the best that I've seen in an mmo, with what seems to be the entire main story line fully voice acted, the actual text in the game appears to just have been tossed into google translate. The game still remains unoptimized, and it shows; opening menus causes the game to stutter and freeze. Combat is very awkward, and was ultimately the deal breaker for me; it feels like they began with a tab targetting system, and then last moment decided to change it - ultimately settling on what can be described as DanceDanceRevolution combat. The combo's seem very sluggish, requiring me to hammer on keys far to many times to ensure that the skill actually goes off. Overall I'm not impressed, and I had such high hopes for this game after playing the korean version of the game a few years ago.

1. Yes the servers have some technical problems, but the devs are making every attempt to fix them ASAP. They are listening to the community and being very responsive.

2. The combat system, on the surface, appears very basic. However, once you level up and start to specialize some of the skills, it becomes VERY deep. There are many paths you can choose to customize your skills to your playstyle.

3. There are some elements which definitely help if you spend some REAL money. However, if you manage your in-game money properly, it's not that difficult to keep up with people who spend real money for the ""bonuses"".

4. The skill curve feels authentic and reminds me of an old game that I can't put my finger on. This gameplay will NOT blow you away, but it has a certain charm to it.

5. The voice acted cutscenes are actually very good and worth paying attention to the first go around. You can skip them if you so choose!

6. All of the classes are not yet released due to balancing issues, but that's ok! The game will have some great additions in the coming months, but has enough content to keep you occupied for an easy 200+ hours of gameplay in it's current state.

7. The auction house is really the only truly negative thing I can say about the game. The interface uses what appears to be a web interface, which is barely usable. Would like to see an overhaul of this interface ASAP.

Overall, the game has a few quirks that you would not see in a triple A title. However, for all of the shortcomings, Bless Online is capturing my heart with something I can't quite describe in words. The base game price is affordable, and worth a purchase if you are looking for something a little different. Expect some downtime and bugs (which are often comical), but the game is still very enjoyable in the current state.",True,1527743891,1527744104,True,0,1,0.000000,True

Granted it's $30 dollars, but you have to understand that almost all Free to Play games end up having some kind of cash shop advantage for those with the big wallet. This $30 price tag avoids any means of pay to win element as Neowiz will have enough $$ to sustain this game. The $15/month premium membership sounds suspicious, but it is not; it allows those who have the premium membership to receive cosmetics such as pet & mount armor, auction house tax reduction, and more (its labeled in the founder packs in the DLC steam tab). The combat is fluid, but as of now those who play berserker are locked to action combat and all other classes are locked to tab target. This game can be boring as a solo person (as like all the others MMOs), but there are a ton of guilds looking for recruits to join their roster. As for the Faction locks and Character Creation locks, you have to understand this is an MMORPG with sieges and World PvP. If there is a faction imbalance, this game would discourage those playing the less populated faction to quit or reroll to the popular faction; Neowiz is trying their best to resolve this issue from happening; so everyone playing the game can play with and against equal amounts of people. As a closing note, you have to understand this is an early access version for Bless Online, so the game will have bugs (but nothing game breaking). In fact, as I am writing this review, the game is offline while Neowiz is taking care a bug with the mailbox.

FOR STARTERS: I know how you all feel, when I saw all that bad reviws and all the youtube videos how bad the game is I wanted to refound the game myself,BUT I WILL NOT BE A SHEEP and follow blindly!!!!

 I spent 150€ for the game,and I had no expectation.

*In the game realy is nothing pay to win so far.
 
At the moment I am lvl 36 and I am realy enjoing the game, people gave it shit because they were expecting a WOW killer like allways (everyone who sed that they wherent expecting that are lying),and the game is avrage.When the game came out on 28.5. it came out for EU at 21:00 so I just downloaded the game and went to bed (because I knew that it will be lag and servers overflowed),when I wake up I normaly started the game and start playing.I had no FPS problems No Lag problems,no quest problems nothing realy, I have a Geforce 980 GTX I run it at 50 FPS on medium setings. The only time it lags for 1s or 2 because you pres L and it popes up the pet system.

*For 30€ you will get a lot of play time,everything else is a waist of money.(THE GAME IS NOT PAY TO WIN!) I WILL NOT refound the game,because the game is not that broken or unplayable like a lot of streamers say or the negetive reviwes on steam! 

*The skill system is very very hard to master,and for me that is fun! so it realy has a steap learning curve.


I WOULD GIVE THE GAME 5/10 overall, its not realy that bad, and the game will get better over time,I am sure of that.

The game is OLD it runs on an OLD engine,sou you cant expect perfection!
People that where born in year 1989 and older know how we played games back in the days :D with Lineage and Lineage 2 :D we have more tolerance if and when something doesnt work or has problems,we belive in fixing them not just flameing and leaving,for that we have the 1995 and UP generations :D

30 Hours in i can happily say that Bless is alot of fun and enjoyable if you like that Old school MMO experience.
The story is great, The combat is fluid and there is alot of learning curve to it.  Crafting and Mount and Pet progression is not easy at all and has some depth to it. 

Yes there are optimization problems  ( not big of a deal once you are out of the city)  and some other problems which do not affect the gameplay majorly , so I am pretty confident in the devs ( They do listen alot )  in fixing them over time .

1: Never played MMO game in their life or have minimal experience
2:Veteran WoW players expecting a World of Warcraft 2 experience

But I have to say their communication as of this week has been amazing, and whomever is making that happen needs a raise. I am so happy they followed through with their cash shop promises and outlined their plans going forward and are addressing concerns so eloquently. 

They gave ample compensation for the downtime experienced for the two day early start, their apologies for their short comings all seemed thought out and sincere. I personally didn't run into any loading screen issues or glitches unlike many of my fellow Imperial players~ I've also had a chance to participate in so much open world pvp even though I'm not max level.

I think I've gotten close to a third of my level 36 exp from gathering alone! I appreciate the set up so much and that certain materials don't 'phase' out. So things that would require floor still take wheat whether they are for apprentice recipes or professional. The recipes just get more complicated. 

I'm enjoying the pets and mounts so much! And there are so many parties being set up for people that want to focus on life skills for the party buffs. I dunno, they've added so many things that I've enjoyed, as I've played all the versions of the game. I thought the initial version was going to always be my favorite, but NeoWiz, you've impressed me I think you're stealing my heart with this one. Especially if some of the nifty things from version 1 make a come back with the third type of companion. 

I really love all the aspects that make socializing and grouping important whether it's pvp, crafting, gathering, finding that perfect pet, elites, guilds, they all have worthy benefits! So even if you're a solo player, it never hurts to join a random buff party where everyone wants to also be antisocial while still getting group benefits! 

For the people worrying about 'censoring' etc, it's honestly not that bad, I've played all the versions like I said, and literally instead of going in to sex scenes you now end up seeing the aftermath, so you literally missed nothing relevant to the story since the point is still conveyed. X slept with Y, and whatever. 

The main con is that yeah, there is no end game or organized pvp THIS SECOND, but I'm happy about because there needs to be some adjustments to the damage numbers and some of the ways the heals work. I feel like in its present state so many people would be getting cheesed, and that's not what queued pvp should be about. I appreciate that the first 'seasons' of the pvp tiers aren't going to taint the experimental stage of the Bless' system for people.

A lot of people complain that the game has come out so many times why are there all these problems, and I honestly think they aren't paying attention to all the changes that are being put in and how many unbalanced and potentionally unbalanced things they've restricted and gotten rid of. A lot of things that people are complaining about not having, like teleporting to dungeons, in my mind takes away from the open world pvp aspects since most of the pvp happens there for lower levels. 

Anyway, back to happy shit, I'm enjoying the game. I love playing with people and I'm enjoying playing by myself. AND WHY THE FUCK IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT THE STORY?! WHAT THE HECK! I could talk about some of these characters for HOURS. I enjoy the storylines so much in comparison to a lot of other mmos I've played. Like it's not FFXIV or FFXI but holy hell do I love how much these asshole npcs murder each other. And then there are surprise sweet moments that make my heart happy, like this zombie that came back from the dead due to magical fluctations in the area, and ends up accidentally saving his daughter that he had never really met because of how long ago he died! And then you have to help with that whole situation and.. ah.. I like it. A lot of people complain about how pointless side quests are, but WHAT?! WHAT?! I have learned so much lore from these side quests. And while yes there are some obvious twists that I saw coming, there were a LOT that I did not! Seeing these npcs so passionate about changing their fate and trying to make a better tomorrow for their off-spring even if it costs their lives, is great. 

The characters are developing, even through side quests. Some npcs are just unredeemable assholes, others are saints, they have motivations and even with some of the 'bad translations' (I'm immune okay, I played this game with google translate translations this is like new york times best seller list comparison okay?) I'm still so invested in the story which has not happened for a lot of mmos I've played over the last... 6 years. 

I don't feel like skipping the storyline MOST of the time, and I feel like for those of you who aren't rushing to get to 45, since you have time before the end game stuff comes, since they said they'll be adding it in starting 2 weeks from now, you have time to enjoy the story! Learn what you're fighting for! Both sides are doing SUPER shadey shit to each other, and the level of large scale manipulation going on makes my heart happy. 'If I wanted a story I'd read a book', well that's nice, but I don't get to personally stab the antagonists in the books in the face repeatedly and leave them to die, now do I? And I read a lot, I love reading. 100 books a year. But more books need to up their story game, 

Bless is scratching so many of my itches. And I'm excited to see what the future is going to hold, because everything is fixable, except for devs being p2w sell outs. NeoWiz, I'm trusting in you, Add some bunny skins, and I'll buy them all! 

(I bought the Deluxe (middle) pack and not the top one because I have some expensives going on right now and I didn't save properly ahead of time! So instead of dipping into my savings I opted to just get the second pack. Anyway, see you all in game!)

I couldn't just sit by and watch all the ""naysayers,"" ruin what is essentially a fair to good game--I'm going to attempt to stray from using words like, crybabies, 12-year old’s, etc. Because even though that's pretty much what it boils down to everyone is allowed to have an opinion...even if they are based on knee jerk reactions, false accusations and fallacy.

Now that that is out of the way. To the ""naysayers:"" I feel for you, I really do. I'm a little envious to be honest that you all obviously did not suffer through the crap shoot that was the Diablo 3 launch. This coming from an industry juggernaut like Blizzard, was unexpected and frustrating. Sure, there were some login issues with Bless, along with server lag and the like. But at least players could actually login and create a character--NOT ALL as I understand it--but it was enough to overload the servers, causing Neowiz to create 3 extra in total on the spot? I'd say that was admirable on the devs part, but maybe I'm just a blind sheep that is easy to please. Point being, there were plenty of other games out there where no one could play at all. Bless was not one of them. I could point out many other launches that have went far more south than this one, but I believe most likeminded individuals, other than myself have already done so; so, no need to beat a dead horse.

The game isn't perfect. The launch wasn't perfect. It still isnt perfect. Nothing is perfect. But at its core is a game I find fun, and does not deserve the backlash it has got from players and ""YouTube"" personalities of the like. Sure, you can blame it on the fact that the game is 5? 8 years old? Some are claiming. Which is true and some of these issues should have been ironed out. But I'm not going to sit here and pretend I know what goes into localizing and developing a game for the overseas market either. But I'd say this is the only complaint that has any credibility what so ever.

There is also--form what I hear--a lack of endgame; such as features that were supposed to be in the game, but are not. I have no way of knowing because I haven't gotten there yet. But I think the real point that needs to be brought up in regards to this is: This was the head start. The game never officially launched until today...well yesterday as I'm finishing this. WoW didn't have an actual ""endgame"" until months after release. The dev's are promising it to use in a shorter amount of time than that.

There was dupe thing...that wasn’t good. Dupes are bad and I hope Neowiz takes the proper action on this one. That ones on you devs, can't argue with the critics there.

There's probably some other details I could go over. But, I’m not here to convince any naysayer to give the game a shot. There's no changing how I feel, so I wouldn’t expect to change anyone else’s opinion. But this is strictly here for those who have not tried the game.

All in all, it’s a good game.

WOW was the worst launch that I ever experience and yet today its the biggest MMO. Most negative comments on here and on you tube are judging the game by its launch, makes me feel that most of those people dont have a lot of experience with launchs. 

 There are several things that i do like about this game. The combat for me is unique with the stances and chains, and that is quite fun and very deep to be honest. There is no action combat here however, but its still a fun tab target mmo. There is a lot of unique mobs, and most of all them can be tamed. So far the dungeons are fun and the pvp looks like it will be good as the combat is very fast. Pve is fun and if you die from pvp there isnt much to lose

  This isnt a perfect game however, they really need to optimize the game better as I am having to play in low setting but most pvp games i do anyway to be competetive. It was a rough launch, with many early bugs that hampered peeps to log in but the servers were overloaded by so many people trying the game.",True,1527742402,1527742402,True,1,16,0.520598,True

1. People who don't understand what ""Early Access"" means.
2. People that don't understand every single MMO has issues in the beginning.
3. People that don't like MMO games.

Bless Online is a theme park quest based PvP focused MMO game with an amazing pet/mount system.
The combat is not action combat, but the combo system makes it extremely engaging, fast paced, and fun.  The animations are impactful and really well done.
The world is standard fantasy MMO fare and the dungeons start easy, but gradually get more difficult as you level.
The PvP is some of the best I've experienced in an MMO.

It's pretty sad there are so many people hating on this game for release week issues.
If you're an MMO gamer that's been looking for something new you can either buy it now, if you're not a moron who expects an early access game to be perfect on day one, or wait a few months and buy it then.  

Bottom line, the game is fun.

I have had a very nice time in this game leveling up and PvP.

Only complaint is the acion mode restriction honestly which to my knowledge will be activated in a upcoming patch this month. but the devs have been very active in squishing recent bugs and dealing with exploits and even given compensation. It shows that they are listening and taking suggestions seriously yet with a grain of salt.

My suggestion is allow the action buttons that appear to also be clickable so add more flexability to encounters and PvP. and have a better way to obtain higher level taming scrolls for those that didnt go into the enchanting proffestion.

The game while advertised is mostly a PvP game, but based on the JP and KR counterparts of content its really a PvX type of game with Raids coming and daily dungeons where Bis gear is obtained and yet crafted. but getting said recipe would probably involve going into said dungeon or raid.

Otherwise there really insnt much to complain about so early on into this version of the games life. Now if this were 3 months after the fact, then yes there would be a problem, but its not.

Neowiz has been fast to respond to issues and things are being addressed quickly. There's also channels to report other issues. Server queues on my server are better already and I expect the character creation to be unlocked soon. The game performed well as soon as I started (1070TI/i5-4670) but the INI tweaks on Reddit have worked well to resolve minor issues I had with the camera, etc. The only lasting issue I have is a minor issue where you can't click on the combo UI which makes RMB camera operation on that part of the screen awkward. I can play fine until it's fixed, so that's fine.

0,51,3,1565,1565,76561198269451089,0,english,False,42397704,"First thing first, there are some serious rough edges.   That being said it is no where near as bad as the reviews would suggest.   The first day of early access was a disaster with frequent crashes and freezes.    After several emergency maintenances and an apology from the devs, the game is much more playable.



I'd describe the game as a moderately above average tab targeter.    Its combat is a bit interesting for a tab target mmorpg.   Your combos are linked requiring you to press r, t, or y after the opening ability to begin your desired combo with you continuing to press those 3 keys as you gain more varied combinations.    The graphics aren't black desert level but when compared to other mmorpgs currently on the oversaturated market, the graphics in Bless Online aren't bad by a long shot.  


Questing is more or less standard fair.   It has quests that are analogous to Tera's ""green"" quests where grinding a bunch of the same mobs completes hunter quests and achievements.


I've heard a lot of people complaining over a lack of end game but as I haven't reached max level I can't comment on it. 

The two primary complaints I have is bad optimization and a camera angle that gets plain weird as you adjust it.   The fps can get pretty bad at times even on a decent pc and the camera seems to zoom in and out in this bizarre crescent trajectory.

If the devs smooth out the rough edges in the coming week and resolve player complaints about end game, i'd recommend it for anyone wanting to try another tab target mmorpg.

I have had alot of lag in some places that after 3 days have gotten a ton better and is rare to happen now for me any where i have been so far.

There are issues still in game that were there from years ago that havent been fixed yet, but so far i havent had any issues with it yet.
If you are going to buy a Founders edition got for it, but i would buy the base game first and see if you are even going to like it first, play it for a couple days and if it hasnt run you off go for it. Alot of people have given this game a negative review becuase they were expecting a pollished 100% game form the start and it is early access for it. Not to mention also that the company that made the game is also running it without a publicher like all the other major mmos are doing, which means they are having to deal with fixing the lag and such, and so many other issues that the publisher usually takes care of.

(And we were compensated for that with $20 of in game currency) I've also had a solid connection since I started playing with no lag whatsoever, so I don't know where people are trying to connect from to experience any kind of lag. 

As for the game, it is a blast.


Combat is fluid, intuitive, and makes pvp really intense. The open world factions based (like WoW) pvp is always a good time. Can't wait for the upcoming pvp content in the next week or two. 

Sidequests are actually fun, but if you want to get down and dirty you can just start killing anything and automatically recieve a quest to kill that monster. (Pretty great honestly if you just wanna practice your skills and not worry about going to find a quest for a specific monster, you also can gain dungeon points doing these)

Pet system is awesome, hilarious, and adds quite a bit of depth to the game. There are a crazy amount of pets/mounts to tame. You can upgrade pets to gain different abilities, and the same goes with mounts. You use other pets as an ingredient, but it can be a little grindy (it is an mmo). 

Talents are really fun, and what you craft is actually valuable/worthwhile. (There is also a secret resource dungeon you can find randomly to aid in crafting (; )

Gear can be upgraded and infused, and talent upgrades allow you to shred even more noobs. It also looks great, and there aren't just a ton of reskins of similar items. There could be more sets, but what is there is very nice.

I just hope they add more content like they say they are going to, as I will be here for awhile.

Only complaint is nerf guardian, and add more stuff. (Classes, levels, end game content)

This isn't going to be a review of praise, nor will be it be a review of unmitigated nerd rage. Believe it or not, unlike other people this game has not ruined my life. I hope to give examples of what most people want to know going into this.

The game isn't perfect but is it the MMO anti-christ? Absolutely not. The game itself is good. When I say good, I mean good. Not incredible, not the greatest MMO in the past decade, it's good. I'm also not saying that the way things launched is excusable, because I'm aware it's not.

Let me get the cons out of the way first, so anyone who's actually interested in this game can get a real idea of what they can expect to notice immediately. I plan to be as objective as possible with the cons, listing things that aren't opinion, but just blatantly obvious. I'm not going to list the combat either because there are plenty of people who enjoy tab-target combat, like myself. I grew up with this type of combat, and while I appreciate action combat and what it's done to revolutionize the MMO genre, I still feel there's room for a classic experience.

FPS Performance - You can expect 30FPS in most situations. Spezia (the first large city) runs terribly. Everything else runs decently. The optimization is hugely limited to the engine and its old-ass code. Aside from the general performance, opening windows in the UI cause micro-stutters (something that actually can be addressed).

The server stability currently is fairly rough but is far better than it was on day one. Day one was inexcusable. A huge miscalculation by Neowiz and everyone knows this, including them.

Translation - It's pretty rough, but if you have a brain and the ability to use common sense, it's almost a non-issue. I say almost because the skill descriptions are absolutely inexcusable. If anything needed to be translated accurately it was the skills and their descriptions.

UI - cannot be modified in any real way and we don't really know if it ever will be modifiable. It's not too large, but also not preferable for some people (including myself). Just something to keep in mind.

There are assorted other bugs that will very likely be fixed in the near future. Some of the worst have already been addressed. None of the remaining bugs ruin the user experience, with the exception of queue times (though that's not really a bug).

Now with that out of the way, I want to tell you that if this game looks interesting to you from the trailers and videos, and what I've said about the current glaring issues the game has don't really bother you, then try it. It's a video game. I suspect you'll live another day if you don't enjoy it. If that's not the case and Bless gives you a sudden aneurysm then I apologize in advance.

Here's some of the things that I personally enjoy about the game, because maybe the things I enjoy, you may enjoy also.

The gameplay feels tight. It's comfortable and familiar. It does what you expect tab target combat to do, but with a little bit of extra umph. This is mostly because of the skill system and how essentially every skill you have can be changed a certain way to suit your preference. There's obviously going to be a meta for each class, but with Neowiz being the publisher, we can expect changes and balances more frequently than we're all likely used to in other Western-published Eastern MMOs with the exception of a few.

There's no pay-to-win. Anyone who says there is, is jaded and uninformed. Pay-to-win isn't using a cash shop currency to teleport around the map more conveniently. That's convenience. You can still travel around the world freely. Pay-to-win is when I can open the cash shop and blatantly purchase an item that gives me a clear statistical advantage over another player which directly affects the other player's gameplay experience (for example being able to buy accessories with extra stats, or items that prevent failing upon upgrade of an item). Someone's ability to teleport to a dungeon faster than your wyvern flight travels, doesn't create an imbalance between players. For the love of God, stop whining. I assume you're adults.

The world is massive and genuinely pretty fun to explore. Climbing mountains to skip through a long pathway saving you some hefty time, is satisfying. The lighting and attention to detail in the textures (armour, landscapes, buildings) and overall world models are clearly created with a lot of care. I find myself taking a lot of screenshots.

The game is heavily PvP oriented, and includes fighting over territories, PvP battlegrounds, open world faction versus faction PvP, etc. There's a whole lot to do for those who love competing with other players face to face.

The auction house is regulated the same type of way Black Desert's is, which I feel is a plus. It prevents massive inflation and economy control by more powerful players and guilds.

 I TRIED to give this game a chance, this game already has a bad reputation from the first two attempts and you would think when you are giving basically a 3rd chance you would HIT the ball rolling with ZERO issues. 

1) No Hell in way you should have someone be a founder and release the game with all the content not even released. As LONG as this game has been out before the release of it again I expected more releasement without delays. 

2) The SAME DUPE issue in the other client that was addressed was NEVER FIXED IN THIS ONE? So pretty much the market is screwed at the start now because people are going to abuse an exploit that should of been fixed before released. They KNEW about this issue, they had ALL the time in the world to fix this issue.

3) I'm upset for the simple fact I gave them the benefit of the doubt and they basically pulled a ""No Mans Sky"" Hell I wouldn't even call it that because even with NMS they actually released the content they didn't put in the game from the start...

What we got is a Non optimised game , that doesn't allow you to play with friends due to character lock on server huge queues of 3 to 4 hours . When you pick a server your also locked with your founder stuff so you can't switch to go join your friends either.

The optimization is also a little spotty at the moment, but this is something that will likely be fixed later.  
 
The positives about the game.  It is fun, the combat is a little different at first and the UI can be a little overwhelming, but once you dive in and understand the game the system is actually enjoyable and makes you consider each combat decision carefully.  The race and character diversity and customization is also very deep, not going to say the deepest of any MMO, but definately in the top 10. The game itself is a pretty large world, and the tutorial quests along the way give you insight about how to move forward and progress.  Not to mention there are TONS of side quests to pick up along the main journey, and the story of the game is actually alright.  It isn't groundbreaking, but its not unbearable either.

Kurzfassung:
Schlecht:
-holpriger Start (nur ein Server, in den ersten 2 Tagen massive Lags, überfüllte temporär gesperrte Server, viele Wartungen)
-Action-Combat-System nur beim Berserker bisher vorhanden, alle anderen müssen erstmal noch Tab'en
-keine Deutsche Übersetzung
-man kann nicht direkt Handeln, sondern nur über das Auktionshaus
-ein zu extremer DmG-nerf

Gut:
-Ausgewogene Questmischungen
-Performance wurde erheblich nach den 2 Tagen verbessert incl. Entschädigung in Form von Ingame Währung für alle Frühstarter)
-Gegenstände kann man kostenlos innerhalb des Accounts den Charakteren per Post versenden
-das unglaublich riesige Petsystem
-soweit ich bisher mitbekommen habe: nette Klassenbalance im PvP (Berserker ausgenommen Grund siehe oben bei Schlecht)
-relativ komplexes Skillsystem
-Channelwechsel ohne Ladebild mit 1 Minute Cooldown um erneut zu wechseln
-bisher kein Pay 2 Win Content entdeckt
-Community hilft sich aktiv gegenseitig


Um erstmal die vielen negativen Reviews zu erklären: (bitte ließt euch alles bis zu Ende, ich finde nämlich trotzdem das es das Spiel verdient gekauft und gespielt zu werden)

Der Start war ziemlich holprig und es war leider ein großer Fehler mit nur jeweils einem Server für EU und NA zu beginnen, da diese binnen 2-3 Stunden überfüllt waren. Daraufhin kamen nach ca 3-4 Stunden 3 weitere Server jeweils für beide Regionen dazu. Leider mussten Neowiz dann die Startserver zum Charaktererstellen für anderthalb Tage sperren, weil sie zu übervoll waren, was natürlich dazu führte, dass viele auf anderen Servern ohne ihren Founderbonus (wenn Deluxe oder Colecter bereits eingelöst waren) neustarten um mit Freunden/ Gilde / ect. zusammenspielen zu können, die nicht früher starten konnten wegen Arbeit oder Downloadzeit. Außerdem ist es nicht wie auf Steam versprochen auf Deutsch (lediglich Videosequenzen haben deutsche Untertitel) und nur der Berserker hat bisher das Action-Combat-System, aber ich hoffe sehr, dass Neowiz es wie versprochen die Tage nachliefert und patcht.
Der zweite Tag war leider auch nicht wirklich besser da die Server den halben Tag durch extreme Lags/Delays unspielbar waren. Es kamen allgemein auch häufig kurzfristige Wartungen und Patches um u.a. neue Server aufzuspielen oder Probleme zu beseitigen oder vor kurzem die für viele schlechte Performance erheblich zu verbessern.
Desweiterem kam vor kurzem ein Update mit einer zu extremen Damage reduzieren, bei der Neowiz definitv nochmal nachbessern muss.


So und nun zu den Dingen warum ich dennoch dieses Spiel empfehle und tatsächlich wirklich gerne spiele:

Es war denke mal allgemein bekannt, dasss Bless nicht neu ist, da es schon in 3 anderen Ländern als Alpha/Beta(evtl. auch normal?) ect. rauskam und dort wohl nicht wirklich Erfolg hatte. (Daten ect. sind mir jetzt persönlich egal, da ich das Westliche Bless davon unabhängig sehe und die anderen Versionen selber nicht kenne/nie gespielt habe) Diejenigen mit denen ich bis jetzt zusammen spiele und das allgemeine jetzige Klima im Offenem Chat ist recht positiv. Es wird sich gerne und viel geholfen untereinander und wenn gefragt wird wie jeder das Spiel so findet sind die meisten Antworten positiv und nur sehr wenige negative dabei, die denke mal leider auch alle hier negativ bewertet haben ohne Neowiz die Chance zu geben bzw. abzuwarten die Fehler auszubügeln. Denn vieles haben sie tatsächlich schon behoben, wie zum Beispiel die Performance, die Lags und einige neue Server (es sind jetzt 7 für EU). Vielleicht liegt es an meinem Alter, dass ich nicht gleich an die Decke gehe, wenn etwas nicht sofort perfekt ist, aber ich sehe noch alles sehr entspannt und genieße das Spiel, trotz seiner bisherigen Fehler.

Das Questen macht, sofern man Englisch kann, recht viel Spaß. Es ist für Leute, die viele MMORPGs gespielt haben natürlich nichts neues dabei, aber ich finde die Mischungen der Quest gut. Mal Reden und hin und herlaufen, dann mal Sammeln, mal Eskortieren, mal Mobs töten... das übliche halt. Ab level 30 erwartet einen von der anderen Fraktion PvP-Aktion auch beim Questen. Nein, es gibt keine PvE Server. Wer PvP nicht mag, sollte also es entweder antesten oder es lassen. Das Kampfsystem ist, da nur der Berserker das eigentliche besitzt nicht so wirklich flüssig, aber ich kam bisher trotzdem mit dem Tab-System zurecht und warte ab, bis Neowiz das für alle Klassen nachliefert. Es gibt mehrere Möglichkeiten zusätzlich zur Mainquest (die man wirklich machen muss um Gebiete freizuschalten) machen kann: Dungeons, Hunting Quests (Monster jagen in 3 Stufen; geben nicht nur exp sondern auch Verzauberungsmaterial für das Equip, dass man für egal welches Level nutzen kann also auch Endgear; also besser aufbewahren); später ab lv 30 PvP gibt auch exp; Neben- und Guidequests. Daneben kann man noch Berufe lernen und sollte sein Sammeln und Taming unbedingt wann immer möglich aufleveln nebenbei, oder wer es mag natürlich hauptsächlich.

Man kann extrem viele Monster zum Reitpet oder Begleiter tamen. Es wird also nicht zum Cashshop-Element, lediglich kosmetische Skins für Pets. Die Rollen, die man zum Tamen benötigt kann man entweder selber herstellen, bekommt sie von Quests oder Levelbelohnungen oder kauft sie von anderen Spielern, die diese hergestellt haben.

Die Skillung der Charaktere erfolgt mit Levelauftieg, allerdings muss man sich dann selbst zusammen stellen welche Stance (Skillreihe) man sich alles aktiv in die Leiste ziehen möchte und welche einzelskills man nutzen möchte. Dann muss man sich um Passive Skillung über extra Punkte kümmern sowie der Aufbesserung der einzelnen Skills. Es gibt also viele, viele Möglichkeiten, einen eigenen Spielstil zu entwickeln. Bisher war auch die Community immer hilfreich untereinander und wird nicht zu müde selbst die 500ste wiederholte Frage erneut zu beantworten. Da es alles gemischte Server sind findet man natürlich auch alle möglichen Sprachen wieder, was ich persönlich schön finde.

Da mir jetzt erstmal nichts weiter einfällt und ich erstmal noch weiterspielen möchte bevor ich noch mehr des Spiels bewerte, werde ich dann lediglich spätere ""updates"" von diesem Review vornehmen, da ich Bless wirklich gerne spiele und noch nicht bei Maxlevel 45 angekommen bin (die Neben- und Huntingquests sind zu verlockend für mich). Ich hoffe trotzdem, dass ich Unentschlossenen ihre Entscheidung ob sie Bless kaufen und anfangen sollten erleichtern konnte egal ob sie sich nun für oder gegen das Spiel entscheiden.

As for class diversity, it's there. For melee dps lovers there's Berserker, which is a late bloomer. For ranged there's Ranger, which has a few problems that need to be addressed but can do well in pvp if unnoticed and can pull off a fully charged snipe. Mages have good mobility, damage, and decent defense options making them great at pvp and solo pve. Tanks get Guardian. Which has very high defense, is nigh unkillable, and can 1 combo anyone in pvp. Needs to be addressed. Lastly healers can choose Paladin. Which has high defense but low damage. Paladin is the only option for healer at the moment.

All in all, pve is balanced well with every class having a role and doing it well. Pvp needs some work. Guardian is just too powerful.

The Graphics look good on character modles but everything els looks dogshit atleast the horses move straight and not fucking side ways like in skyrim base game lol outside that vegitation looks like an old ps2 games the textures and fields look like developers copy and pasted a flat surface and added abunch of random shit all around the map and then droped in groups of mobs on said map visually i dont mind the mobs but moving on 


2.) Sound 
i personally had to turn the music off after like 1 hour of listening to it, it was rather dull and retarded with a mix of ok and what the fuck all in the same mix outside that voice actors were not paid enough for this game and it shows with the voice actors sounding like that dude from start trek....who brakes before every other word.. combat sounds are fucking spot on they sound just like a wiffle bat hitting a fucking tree they nailed this

3.)Loading screens
so we all have seen them and fuck do they exist in this game we start off with this games mini game called the login simulator where the user fights to get into this game over and over as he fights Rngesus for the right to enter the game called bliss and if you dont do this multiple times to make RNGesus happy well you cant get in, outside of that the games pretty good on the loading screens alot of that has to do with the fact there is literally nothing in the game hell by now frame rate may be fixed because of all the refunds lol aka players leaving = ok experience... lol 


4.)Combat 
where to begin.... ANY range class by right out performs melee class in pvp and id imagine in pve as well mainly because of the lack of gap closers they can just kite the fuck out of them till they die and since most of the melee users skill force them to sit fucking skill that zippy little mage on crack can now run circles around ur dumb ass spaming nuke skills btw he can move and cast at same time so now you see where the developers favored  range types. Now pve content is where this game somewhat shines it is fun and i know previous reviews i watched on youtube said combat was too difficult and that it was impossable to solo well boys thats not the issue now lol you can solo a whole fucking dungeon by urself its that easy boys !

5.)Taming Pokemom bless edition!
so all you fuck boys who like to catch poor mobs and be like look at my fucking dank meme gotta catch them all NERD
yes that 10 foot tall rock giant from ark is here you can catch that motherfucker and ride him just like in ark! HELL even wyverns are tamable and able to be flown around like a crack head or so they say but with the games state i see somone flying out of boundrys and ending up in dot hack personally the abillity to tame ur own mounts and pets is a unique feature that i personally enjoy id stay and play this just to fucking catch them all 


6.)Exp Gain 
Feels like a fucking korean grind game lol like top fucking kek... anyway honestly its not that bad burst dungeons and  main story Q and you can hit lvl 20 with ease 


                                                                 OVERALL RATING
                                                      on a scale of 1 to fucking 10 i give this game a 5 

mainly because the game shows promise and with it being early access you cant really be judge mental on the retard syndrome that comes with under paying staff. ITS not bdo and its not guild wars 2 its kinda steals alot of things from other mmos and trys its best to make them work while at this moment combat is garbage and so is other things its a ok game but thats all it is OK but i do recommend supporting the game mainly to support my campain to catch all the fucking pokemon in this game thanks and hope it helps",True,1527736481,1527736481,True,0,1,0.000000,True

The devs have already done a TON to fix the disaster that was launch day. Yes, the skill translations are still absolutely terrible, but apparently they trusted the translations to a third-party localization company and they did a shit job of it. Here's some things that the devs have already improved a lot on:

- I'm getting literally double the FPS today in non-town areas than on the first day. Can you really expect to have 60 FPS in the main town on the first day, when literally the entire server is sitting in one spot at the same time? I'm pretty sure WoW's Lagforge was the same
- The annoying title screen bug has been fixed
- Server queues for all servers are down to 0 today
- No more quest lag, it's been fixed
- And most importantly: The devs have apologized profusely and offered founders pack purchasers $20 worth of in-game currency. And by the way, if you look at the cash shop closely, you'll notice that Lumena buys convenience items such as teleports and inventory expansions and NOT power increasing items.

People calling this game a ""cash grab"", ""pay-to-win bullshit"", etc. haven't even given the devs a chance here. They recovered incredibly well from an enormous first day that was hyped up a shitload by big Twitch streamers.

Now, I'm only level 30 writing this review, so I can't speak to endgame content. But I think Steam purchasers have been burned so many times they're unwilling to put any faith in an early access title at this point. The devs have so far done everything right to help fix some honest first day mistakes and problems. I think the game still deserves a chance.",True,1527736466,1527736466,True,0,2,0.000000,True

0,95,2,4412,4412,76561198050855617,0,english,False,42396630,"The steam release of Bless Online has been out for a few days now, and it's had a couple of issues. Servers were over populated, kept crashing, and bugs left and right. These are issues that many MMO's suffer from in the first few days, but now those problems are pretty much over. Most of the negative reviews were based on long queue times and poor preformance. I will attempt to adress some things that people who are looking to buy are considering.

1. The game is in Early Access. This means the game is incomplete and has many issues. That being said, there are plenty of things to do in game. There are many quests and dungeons, leveling up to 45, over 660 creatures to tame into mounts or pets, dueling, open world PvP, and non-combat skill leveling. The game is beautiful on just about all video settings, but they are still working on optimization. There are a few bugs that the development team is working hard to fix, and so far Neowiz ""the company"" has been listening to the community and acting on it. Expect to run into a few issues, but overall the game is fun with more content coming out and much to look forward too.

2. The company is listening to the community. This is something that not a ton of companies do, and so far i'm impressed. The development team is listening to suggestions, fixing bugs as they pop up, and the company itself is trying really hard to keep the community happy. When there was a problem they compensated the players, when a duplication issue occured they fixed the problem and rolled back the server, when specific servers got too crowded they locked them so players would spread out betwen all the active servers. 

3. The game is estimated to be in Early Access for about six months. Through these six months they plan on releasing two classes that aren't ready yet, the assassin and mystic, they also plan on adding more dungeons, eventually increasing the level cap when more content is available, fixing many issues and bugs that pop up, possibly adding a couple more races to choose from, and improving the new combat system they put in place.

4. The game was designed around an open world PvP system where two opposing factions are constantly at war. This game is open world field PvP, which means anywhere is a PvP zone. However, most areas are protected by a faction for players under level 30. After that there items that can be obtained in game to temporarily prevent yourself from being in PvP. 

5. The world is beautiful. Bless is completely open world with no loading screens unless you teleport long distances or enter private instances. The only private instances so far are dungeons and a few quests that require a different setting. That means you can walk from one side of the map to the other without being in a loading screen, and there is much to explore. The game has pretty good graphics and model quality which makes the world amazing, but brings me to my sixth point.

6. The game is computer intesive. This game is using some pretty high graphic settings, so the minimum PC requirements are quite high. Many people have been complaining about not being able to run the game, but a lot of them don't meet system requirements in all specs or they try to run the game at max settings with a cheap computer. It is important to note that even if you have the best graphics card, a crappy CPU will prevent you from utilizing any of it. Make sure that all parts of your computer are at the same level or better than the minimum requirements. As i've said before, all video settings still look beautiful. 

This is most important to note: I will say this again, the game is in Early Access. There is a lot to do, but it still requires much more content. If you are looking for a full title release then I would suggest waiting the six months until they release the full game. If you are getting impatient or want to help and experience  the development, now is the time to join. This game is in a ""soft launch"" which means that all of your character data will NOT be wiped when the game comes to the end of Early Access. 

If you have any questions or concerns, look at the official forums where many people are debating about hot topics such as Pay2Win and the current state of the game. Form your own opinion and see if you like it! https://bless-source.com/",True,1527736339,1527736339,True,0,0,0.476190,True

Due to the numerous problems with the optimization of the client, as well as translation issues with the game, I am giving this ""mmo""a hard pass.  
There are game elements issues as well, stopping it from being ""fun"".  

The supposed avoidance of pay to win mechanics always skirts the edge of pay to win no matter how they try.  Winning could mean achieving a higher level with more rewards than others in an mmo, faster, so that you have an advantage. The cash shop in this game ticks that box.

This stinks to me of a company buying the rights to a pretty game in a new market, specfically for the purpose of a cash grab before it inevitably fails.

There are a few other steam games that seem like early access attempts to grab as much cash as possible with dlc and microtransactions in an unfinished game, and then the ""devs"" abandon it.  This game is now on that list for me.

The issues this game has will not be solved through this ""early access"" without massive changes that I am unsure this company is even capable of.  The scope of the amount of programming changes they can make will remain to be seen,  though not by me :)

Questing : Boring and level gaps where you have to grind X# of mobs to fill exp in order to move to next quest chain. And grind the very same solo dungeon seemingly endlessly. But hey theres cool dungeon traps.  (Besides the game itself being a trap.)

Premium bonus : Your founders pack has junk that only lasts 30 days, including the skins for mounts.

Gathering: Besides there being maybe 4 graphics between what nodes look like you also have to buy harvesting tools which expire per harvest (like GW2) and it takes too long (Maybe helped by better tools though, still annoying)

Character Creation : Very fun.

Classes : Limited, as of right now there are only 4 playable with warlock and mystic being locked. Bummer.

Combat: About as fun as tab targeting the wrong mob that instantly respawns and pressing 1, r, r, t, 1, y, y, t. while strafing so you don't get murdered by other things that instantly respawn. (Controller not supported)

Skill tree: Holy crap! Convoluted and unforgiving. While also not really giving you a whole lot of variety, especially at low levels. Nothing is ""New"" its just recycled abilities from most the classes you'd find in a game like WoW, which is standard in most mmo's; however...having a limited action bar makes everything rely on combos which each ability gets ""leveled"" with gems you earn from leveling and each ability seems to have a limited amount of combo sets. You'll probably just use what you start with, level that and not even touch anything else because it will be too expensive to experiment.",True,1527736113,1527736135,False,6,132,0.635655,True

I've been a part of several ""new"" MMO's launching from over seas and comparatively this one has gone pretty good. yes, there were server issues like every other launch, yes there are optimization issues like every other launch, and yes there are even mass amounts of crybabies that are just blindsided that things aren't perfect like every other launch.

all in all, Neowiz has done a pretty good job at being up front and pro-active about problems. head start was 2 days ago and there has already been a patch to fix bugs with some classes and a crippling bug causing several people to be unable to actually start up the game.

Common negative topics:
-A lot of people are irritated and upset about a lot of end game content that is released in the other versions of the game around the world not being included in our version such as arenas, sieges, and some high-end dungeons. Personally while a lot of the content that was held back were definitely items that drew me to this game in the first place, however, i don't think its surprising or a bad idea to bring in content in stages to help with longevity as well as server stability with an extremely volatile player base.
-The plan to launch one server at a time was (i'll agree) a terrible idea, i realize that they had no way of knowing exactly how much interest they would have in this game at launch but starting with one server was incredibly naive given NA's history of MMO launches as well as the incredibly active discord and social media channels devoted to Bless. As for the stability, that's an issue  that will get fixed with less fluctuations in population and will always be a problem in every game that underestimates its incoming amount of players.


I absolutely attribute the majority of the negative reviews Bless has received to MMO player base at large, I've seen this exact same reaction every single time a new MMO comes out due to various reasons such as being over-hyped before it comes out, communities pump up its member about this ""amazing MMO that's coming out"" ""its doing it differently"" "" its going to be the greatest MMO we've ever seen"" and then when it gets  here, its a slightly different variation of games we've all played before, they do some things better, they do some things worse, and perhaps add some new features and a unique original story line. other players just like to troll and bash on everything they can.

1- Let me start first off by saying i got the collectors addition on the 28th. Yep paid $150 USD for this game.
2- Optimization is trash. 
3- The game is running DX9 that is an extreamly old driver.
4- The servers crash every 15 to 20 minutes.
5- I had to make over 15 characters because i kept getting locked out of NA servers because of overcrowding.
6- I made my main XP bosted character on Tanara got to level 12 and got diconnected. Came back to see that i was put in a que with over 4,000 people before me........
7- Translation is just shit.
8- Servers half the time are locked out. Most servers were full for the last two days.
9- Game that has been in developent for over 3 years core game is so bad i can't even... i just can't... I was so hopful and it's so bad

I remember hearing about this game way back when I was playing Tera all the time. When I found out about it was coming out on Steam I became hyped. I was hoping for another game like Tera with its great looks and outstanding action combat. I started the game and I was a little upset with not being able to load past the Bless screen. I would exit a few time and restart the game. After a few attempts I was able to get in. I found the character creation was similar to other high end MMO's, so I was thinking this was great I found a Tera replacement. After playing the game for 8 hours on three different days, I found myself wanting to play another game. Just so everyone that reads this knows I don't get bored easy, I still play Skyrim. :D 
As Steam says, This game cannot be refuned. I know why now. I'm not calling the game horrible, its just not for me. I kinda want 60 fps most of the time, action combat, and a fast and responsive UI. This game would be great 5 years ago, but I guess I have come to expect more. My rig is about 4 years old now.

I then Created my character and while doing that I somehow managed to get my characters bottom jaw bone and teeth and all to be outside of the skin of the chin.

Upon finishing character creation I go into the game and almost instantly cannot figure out what the hell is going on with the tutorial stuff I killed goblin dude and used potion before I had accepted the quest to do so and was stuck there for around 5 min before I figured out you had to run all the way back to the start of the tutorial to get the goblin to respawn.

The rediculously bad UI and extremely laggy menu's IE open any window game freezes for 3 to 8 seconds before the window opens.

After having finished the Tutorial I take my beserker out for a spin testing it out, which proved to be kind of a pain with really low fps so I dropped the settings down notch by notch and the frames pretty much stayed the same 15 or less and all it did was make it to where nothing loaded until you were on top of it and buildings were pretty much dark spots on the ground where they were supposed to be, which makes the game very unplayable in low settings, then after about 15 min or so of playing the game and trying to make sense of the menu's and such I notice that my hotbar is completely gone, so I spend the next 10 min going through the menu's trying to see if I had somehow pressed a button that made the hotbar go away, this was not the case, I ened up resorting to trying to relog to see if it came back and to my surprise it did.  Upon playing a bit longer I get to first dungeon and almost instantly my hotbar does its pattented vanishing act while in the dungeon, I go through the dungeon all while hoping that I have enough potions or whatever else I need on the hotbar that is invisible for the duration of the dungeon ((if you run out while hotbar is mia you have to open your inventory and manually use potions from there)take in mind you have some realy bad lag when opening menu's).

I finish the dungeon and having recieved equipment for character classes not even implemented in the game which I found to be a bit strange, I continued my bland journey in this Potato.  I found it to be very easy to find random paths up onto the mountains around the landscape.. which upon breaking into those areas which shouldnt be accessable from the ground, to my wonderment there was nothing but baren landscape devoid of any and all things just alot of nothing.

After playing a while longer I made it to another Dungeon and no sooner than I step inside my hotbars do their magic trick and vanish again... which is a pretty big pain in the ass seeing as to how you have to relog to fix the issue.

Thus I did some research and come to find out that the character classes that were locked out would eventually be playable IE no decernable date for that.  There was no end game content as in non existant.  I wasnt the only person having the seriously bad lag issues.  90% of the help chat channel was people talking about how powerful their pc was and the issues with the lag.  The overly broken economy due the latency issues and Marketplace bug that allowed people to duplicate items which ruins the marketplace (personally had to open marketplace 5 different times to get it to actually load right).  

I then Promptly refunded the game because alot of the things that were said to be in the game were not there at all, so with this being said I would not recommend this Potato to anyone.

I like the game in general, but there are still a lot of things that could use some work.

I bought the two day head start because I was enthousiastic about the game, after having done so I recomended my friends not to buy it during the headstart, the game often got stuck while connecting to servers, we had a day of immense lagg and crashes occured often, it was nothing smooth. After the public released all things above were fixed (atleast for me) but I believe it has for most people. The game has a refreshing combat system for a MMO, the graphics are nice, what was a hugedeal for a lot of people was the cashshop, I can safely say as of now it has nothing P2W. I like the autotravel, like the way you can tame pets (and lots of them). Up untill now I like playing it a lot.

Yet there's also room for improvements in my opinion, when you are in a HUB city the sheer amount of players can cause for a little lagg, this has been improved already, and for me its far from gamebreaking. Translations could use some improvements, generally its okay but sometimes the wording is a bit off, help chat can usually help you with it. I personally dont like we cant trade stuff, altough there has been added a trade option which is as of now not available but we might see it in the future.

first off the horrible lag and disconnecting plus not being able to log into the game after restarting it over and over again was a terrible experience.

secondly even though i liked the idea of the skill combos the long animation times made me get killed many times over being unable to move and use abilities without the ability to stop and animation on some abilities it makes for a horrid time trying to stay alive.

One should expect a little latency or fps drops at times, but that is to be expected on any MMO release, and the devs are working on it very regularly.

There is quite a bit to do in-game, and different players tackle them in different manners. Some just rush to lvl 45, and some just take it easy and enjoy the ride. 

Among the things to do is Pet and Mount taming, of which the scrolls can be obtained from either enchanting (Main Crafting Class) or buying them from players through the Auction House. I like the fact that there is a lot of variety in mounts and pets, and not the usual similar monsters running around everywhere. 

At the moment, the only thing that bothers me in-game would be the server locks, which deny players from joining their friends/guilds on a specific server due to them being full. And also that there is pvp just outside dungeons, which means that the opposing faction can kill you while you wait for your party at the dungeon entrance (That being lvl 30+, at the 3rd dungeon in-game). 

I would overall Rate the game in this manner:

Graphics: 8 - I mean, this game may be a little old even though it has just been released in EU/NA, but the graphics are still quite decent if you ask me, and that also depends on the player himself. I don't really mind about graphics in general.

Music: 8 - In my opinion the music is very well made.

Cinematics: 9 - Most cinematics are very fun to watch, and are also very well made. Although earlier on they were a little buggy, but it should be fixed now.

Content: 7 - At the moment I am only level 40, so I cannot really judge end-game content, but until level 40, I can say that it is pretty fun, especially if you play with a group of friends. There is a decent amount of dungeons, lots of mines and plants to gather, similar to WoW in the open world. Also the taming is quite entertaining, if you have the scrolls to use.

Gameplay/Controls: 8 - I have heard many people complain about the combat system in this game, although I cannot seem to agree with them. I have played several MMO's, and everyone is entitled to have a different opinion. I think that the controls are pretty fluent, and the combat skills are very dependant on how good you are, due to combat and switching trees mid fight. I think it is interesting and a good change. Although further on in the future, there should be an update coming to the combat system, which many players seem to be anticipating.

Conclusion: 8/10

Overall, I would recommend this game, even though the minimum price for purchasing it is like 30$. I would just like to remind you that this is early access, and a few ups and downs are to be expected. If you do not wish to buy it yet, that is understandable, as not everyone wants to buy into a game with mixed reviews. But if you are looking for a different MMO that is fun to play, I would recommend you trying it. Don't listen to other people with 5-10 hours of gameplay. I have played almost through all early access with no sleep, and I do find the game enjoyable until now. Of course, if this changes, I will update my review accordingly.

I didn't get any of that brand new, awesome, RPG feel.

The music is wonderful to listen to, even just in the background.
The voice acting isn't terrible, not great but not terrible. I've come across a lot worse voice acting but some are rather good in Bless.
The combat system is tab targeting, but with the fancy combo system it feels dynamic and is a lot of fun and the different builds lets you play how you feel is best.

The character creation is very nice, it's not too overly complicated but has enough options to make sure your character is your very own.
The in-game shop is for cosmetics and minor boosts, no pay-to-win!
If you group up you get small bonuses, so it really pays to play with friends.
The abilities are fun, feel great and are just awesome and makes you feel bad ass.

0,105,3,3405,3405,76561198020921585,0,english,False,42395195,"Ugh where do I begin, this game had an extremely rough start, but I think made up for it in the end. 

Launch day consisted of extremely full servers (nearly 2 hours wait time) followed by down servers for emergency maintenance. In short, the servers would come back up, it would instantly get full, you would wait for 2 hours to get on the server and the server would go down for maintenance again. It was extremely frustrating. 

So your 2 day head start (if you got the deluxe package like I did), was really a 1-1.5 day start. Additionally nothing was ever mentioned about the founders packs not only being character locked, but server locked too. That was a sad discovery to most.

One final thing, still affecting the game today, and one of the most frustrating is the load screen. There is an annoying bug that doesn't allow you to pick your character or see the server list. You frequently have to restart the game 4-5 maybe even 20 times for it to randomly work. There are ""fixes"" but yet it still happens occasionally. 

Ok, so the TLDR of the negatives. Servers got ROCKED on launch, the game was pretty unstable and it was constantly going down for maintenance. Now, why did I mark this as recommend. 

The devs are looking out for the community. On original launch, they planned on only launching two servers, one NA and one EU. On launch we actually got three for NA (I don't play EU and never checked, I assume they also had three). During the first emergency maintance they stood up another server and fixed some of the population issue, once that started to get rocked, they stood up another. Being an IT guy, I know it's not an easy task to do that and it was very impressive the short amount of time they did it and the quick response time of the devs.

Second, the game has drastically got better since the two days of launch. A lot of the recognized bugs have been fixed and better optimized and the servers are way more stable. There has only been one SCHEDULED maintenance period and that was for the non founders pack members to join. Two hour maintenance and no issues. 

Finally, and this is what got me to actually recommend the game. Anyone who bought a founders pack because of the issues, the team provided an extra 2450 lumens. The devs knew they messed up, listened to the community and provided a response. It was a surprise they did it and was much welcomed. 

Final thoughts, the game still has a lot to be fixed. After its now third or forth launch I would have hoped all the bugs were gone, but it still seems some remain. I am heavily enjoying the combat system, the dungeons and the pvp. Although I am not yet max level and got to end game content, the game is relatively fun and has peaked my interest. 

I hope the devs continue to make improvements and expand the game.

The first two hours of owning this game was trying to fix the resolution bug, and then it was several hours trying to get past the spash screen. After finally getting into the game, it became even more than apparent that I had just wasted my time.

The game plays like a free-to-play game, and the payment model is rather off putting. 
This ""buy-to-play"" game is free in other regions where it has been released for some time. There are still free-to-play elements in the game such as the micro-transactions (bag space, boosters, travels etc...) and in addition to that they've added a premium subscription at $14.99 a month. 

Google Translate was likley used which made understanding skills more rough than it should have been. 

Classes are race locked, but the character creation is nice (way more than what this game needs, and the only compliment I will give it.) 

Leveling is too fast (note that I used no boosters until level 30 or so and mostly stuck to quests,) and max level is only 45. The level cap is too low as is, and all of the end game content as advertised was either bugged, or missing from the game entirely. Most players hit max level in just two days.

Leveling isn't exactly fluid either; be advised that there is one gap between your level and the quests around 11-13, but thereafter if you do all the side quests, then you will easily out-level dungeons that are geared to your level. 

Combat is so very dissapointing. They advertised this as action based combat, but it's currently not - the advertised combat system was ripped out, and now you have this hollow/static boring combat with a camera that makes no sense. The videos are a lie.

Want to teleport to a dungeon? That's going to cost you money. Yes, it's a petty complaint but being that the game is huge and empty, it's a pain to run everywhere. It's like a vendor putting a huge mark-up on water, and turning the heat on in a concert hall in the middle of summer.

Gear and weapon variety - there is none!  It seems to be one type of green to drop outside of dungeons with a chance to be blue (non-set peices of one flavor per class,) and one dungeon set per class. 

There are ways to enhance gear, but nothing too in-depth. The skins are very generic and bland - my bet is that the reason for this is that they'll release several ""costumes"" for the cash shop per month at ridiculous prices.

The mailbox and market UI will seldom load in (they are web-based,) and if and when they do, the buttons are generally non-responsive. I once got lucky and got to list a few things, only to discover the restrictions on how much or how little you can list an item for, and that you can only sell 10 things at a time. You may as well just vendor everything. 

I will say that the cash shop is fully functional! I'm sure that was a top priority. 

There is NO player trading! This might explain why the DEVS DIDN'T FIX DUPING WHICH HAS BEEN A KNOWN ISSUE SINCE RELEASING THE GAME IN OTHER REGIONS. 

Outside of crafting reagents and repairs there is NOTHING to spend your in-game earned gold on. There is literally no reason to go out and grind, and again, nothing to do end game.

Bag restrictions/space - you get very little, and will have to cash shop the rest. The cost ends up being around an actual dollar per slot. Your inventory will fill up relatively quick being that it is so small.

Crafting is a huge let down. It's a ""system"" that is so shallow it feels like just an idea someone scribbled onto a napkin one afternoon while he/she was out to lunch.

Speaking of huge jokes, outside of towns, the map is pretty big, and there are literally no assets anywhere - it's so painfully empty. 

More technical issues:

If you have to change the game's resolution, don't. The game will lock/bug you out, and you will end up having to delete the .INI file, and then checking the files through Steam to re-generate it. The launcher settings, and the settings from your graphics programs don't seem to cut it. 

Most settings in general are missing or limited. To play the game and make it visually tolerable you will have to edit the .INI settings. Again, the game is DX9 and capped at 60 FPS.

My thought is, that  If the .INI tweaks are improving the game so much, and it's such common knowledge, surely the devs knew about it, but were too lazy to fix. This speaks volumes regarding the quality of work you can expect to see from them. I get that PC gaming is different than console, but players shouldn't have to edit game files of any kind.

But If that weren't enough, be prepared to brave various log-in issues, and if you are lucky enough to get past the spash screen, expect random FPS drops, and semi-frequent crashing while in game.

An added note: 

The devs offered everyone a refund that wanted it due to being mislead before launch...I've petioned Steam over 9 times, and they won't refund.

It might fail so hard that all future developers think long and hard about not brining a premium quality product to the table. While I'm having fun myself, at it's current price point, Bless definitely has a buyer beware tag on it.

I've been around the MMORPG genre since Ultima Online back in 1998. I've seen pretty much every major mmo launch and particapted in almost every major MMO beta that has existed. Bless is definitely not the worst I've seen in that regard, however, that's like saying you are not the smelliest person in the room. You still stink, so it's not really a compliment.

Things like constant disconnects, splash screen error, translation screw ups, happen in a lot of mmo releases(even those that have technically ""been around a while""). That's not a pass as I feel a lot of these issues could have been circumvented with a proper testing group. You could argue that is what the current playerbase is (and that's a valid point since it's ""early access"") supposed to be doing since the game hasn't offically released (at least in this region).

You can definitely see a lot of extremely novice mistakes that could have easily been remedied with a proper internal testing of the game. Letting your emissaries have a proper experience to give you some kind of feedback that wasn't a blantant scripted event.

People are not demanding mass refunds because they are overreacting. While I'm not experiencing a lot of the same issues others are having, it's enough complaints that they are valid issues that need addressed. I honestly think this mass influx of refunds could be a blessing in disquise (no pun intended) to wake up developers working on future mmo's to step up you game. People are using Bless as an example that they are no longer willing to just except half ass effort while sitting there smiling like everything is going to be ok.

Bless could turn things around, but I don't think anyone really expected this to be the next big thing. It's always been more of a filler game while waiting for an upcoming expansion or a way to hold you over until something else comes out. The game will find it's playerbase and probably turn out to be ok if the devs make some kind of attempt to show a pulse and resolve issues.

As said, in it's current state, it does not warrant the price tag it's being offered and some might not even be willing to pick  it up for free at this point. Whether you enjoy it or hate it. 

I'll reverse my review if things start to change for the better. The ball is in the devs court on whether that happens or not.

Here's a few points why:

- Most issues have been fixed within the first 2 days of early access.
- Performance has been boosted significantly.
- Servers perfoming to their best.
- Splashscreen issue has been fixed.

The combat:
It's... well, different but different in a good way. They did a good job on changing the normal tab-targeting and added great action combat for the berserker class, but since the other classes still have the ""old"" combat i can see how it get's boring for people who are used to bdo or tera.
The combo system is something i highly like since i've always been annoyed by having 30abilities on the screen at the same time. The combos are somewhat customizable and add a ""rythmic"" feeling to the combat. You can switch between 2 stances which each have a total of 3 skills with each skill having 3 combo options, aswell as your non-combo skills.
Overall it gives a good variaty so it doesn't get booring if you're just grinding for hours and hours.
One difference that i strongly like is that the animations actually make sense where the skill deals damage when the animation hits the enemy, since some lock you in place you'll have to adapt to situations and can't just faceroll like in other mmos.
All in all a good combat system imo.

Questing:
It's like in every other mmo tbh. Simple questing like we all know it, same boring stuff with a decent story though.

The PvP

The open world pvp is something I really like but isn't broken in a way where you can camp starter areas or significant grinding spots. The combat works great for pvp and the balancing is still being tweaked but already decent to a point where you can say all classes have a chance to compete.

Giving the developers props to how they listened to their community in the last 2 days and unlike others stick to their vision of how the game should be with tweaks like trading being available, ect. but still leaving the open world pvp in where you are bascially forced to participate

I don't experience any issues now thankfully.

So for the actual game and why I recommend it:
The story is regular RPG stuff but I've been quite immersed because of the interesting characters and dialogue screens.
The world is huge and beautiful with so many different and unique creatures from what I've seen
The combat is super fun and mobile. This is definitely a PvP game and relies more on mechanics than most of todays RPGs

At the end of the day after you grind and grind you come to find out the main aspect of the game taming requires the skill enchanting to make the scrolls because as of right now there is no way for you to get those scrolls. To make those scrolls it requirs too much stone than what there is ingame. when you mine a stone node you get 1 stone and the nodes are not that common.

Num geral, minha avaliação é a de que o jogo vale a pena ser comprado e jogado SIM!

Em número, eu diria que esse jogo merece um 6 numa escala de 0 a 10. (Considerando que eu daria 10 para Guild Wars 2 por exemplo)

Entrando em detalhes.

Os problemas de LAG, um dos principais pontos que muitos jogadores reclamaram e se utilizaram após pouquíssmo tempo de jogo como uma razão para criticar o produto das piores formas possíveis. Eu acho que o problema do LAG existe sim, mas está sendo trabalhado, em 3 dias de jogo a melhora foi imensurável, hoje na data do lançamento oficial o jogo, em minha opínião, está OK, jogável, o desempenho ainda tem muito o que melhorar e os desenvolvedores podem trabalhar bastante nessa área, mas já está um produto OK por ser B2P e não P2W.

A questão do P2W ou B2P. Pra mim o jogo é B2P nesse momento sim, por mais que existam facilitadores exclusivos com o buff premium, todo o resto do jogo pode ser alcançado por dentro dele mesmo (assim como acontece em jogos consagrados como Guild Wars 2 e Archeage). Logo o jogo não se torna desbalanceado por permitir que todo e qualquer jogador, pagando premium ou não tenham acesso a toda a gama de itens e recursos do jogo. Ainda assim acho válido a menção, que gastar dinherio no jogo facilita sim que certas metas sejam alcançadas, mas não existem impedimentos para quem não paga.

A questão da inovação e gráficos. Desde que o jogo seja imersivo o suficiente para se passarem horas sem que o jogador perceba e faça com que o jogador queira mais, creio que para mim essas são questões secundárias, e dos MMOs que testei nos últimos anos, Bless me trouxe essa sensação de imersão, não existiu uma estagnação que me fizesse querer sair do jogo porque já estava cansado de fazer a mesma coisa ou não tinha sensação de avançar (detalhe, ainda não cheguei no end game, mas já foi anunciado que o end game esta sendo trabalhado e já vais er bastante ampliado no prazo de até 2 semanas). Logo por mais que se diga que não são gráficos ou inovações de 2018, isso não configura um problema para o jogo, em minha opinião.

A mecânica de combate é bastante intuitiva e fácil de pegar o básico, outro ponto que acho positivo, desde que exista a possibilidade complexificar ela, a medida que se vai masterizando tudo.

Difatti ero al punto di fare il refund e mettere una recensione negativa.

Tuttavia...non mi sento ancora di bocciare a pieno un gioco che è stato rilasciato 2 giorni fa ed è ancora in EA e vi spiegherò i motivi (ripeto è solo una mia opinione)

Tralasciando il fatto del combat/gameplay che è abbastanza soggettivo, dunque può piacere come non piacere e tralasciando il fatto che io ho una patata al posto del pc (quindi non posso giudicare i cali di FPS, vanno gia male di loro lol)
posso dire che:

1) Si, non è stato uno dei migliori start, ma quale gioco al day one è perfetto?
2) Il team di Bless, per quanto impreparato o sprovvisto inizialmente, è riuscito a prendere in tempo i problemi che si sono venuti a creare e hanno fixato e stanno tutt'ora cercando di sistemare e migliorare la stablità del gioco e tutti i disguidi inerenti ad esso, ancora oggi lo hanno dimostrato, portando vari fix tempestivi per quanto riguarda i server e la stablità.
3) E' vero, ci sono dei problemi di fondo come la mancanza di content end game non rilasciati, ma fortunatamente hanno avvisato che li introdurranno nell'arco di due settimane, quindi guys take your time, nessuno vi obbliga a rushare.
4) Il gioco in se non è poi così male, non sarà attualmente il miglior MMO uscito, ma secondo me bisogna ancora esplorarlo per bene e vedere come si evolverà e come ovviamente andrà a migliorarsi (in peggio non può andare) nel futuro.
5) A quanto pare la componente P2W ATTUALMENTE è INESISTENTE. e questo la potrebbe dir lunga su tante cose.
6) Per scusarsi dei vari problemi il team di Bless ha regalato 2400+ lumena (20 euro circa?) a tutti coloro che avevano acquistato i vari founder pack. Quante compagnie avrebbero fatto lo stesso? Non è quello che uno si aspettava magari, ma QUANDO è GRATIS è BELLO quindi +1!.


Morale della favola: Nulla è perfetto, ci potranno sempre essere imprevisti, l'importante è come si reagisce ad essi.


Consiglio Bless Online?:
 1) Si, se hai pazienza (per via che è in EA) e cerchi un gioco nuovo da esplorare e condividere con gli amici, da prendere senza impegno INIZIALMENTE.
2) No, se non sei in grado di accettare problemi/disguidi vari in un gioco che è in continuo aggiornamento/miglioramento e pretendi che tutto sia perfetto.

Non mi sono dilungato per quanto riguarda il gameplay ed altro, perchè è puramente una cosa soggettiva, come dicevo poche righe più sopra.

In tal caso, se non siete sicuri di acquistarlo potete vedere eventuali gameplay su twitch, youtube o se siete temerari e curiosi prendere il gioco base a 29,99€.

Sperando per il meglio e che tutti i vari problemi si sistemino da...Un player come tanti :)

A game should be able to capture your attention and justify the purchase in the first hour of playing, even when it is an Early Access title. With it's sub-par voicing and it's poorly optimized gameplay, along with a somewhat counter intuitive UI, this game failed to do that. Add ontop a toxic community to start with in the help-chat of the servers.

I am sorely disappointed by it, even after having high hopes for a new MMO. 

It does bring some interesting ideas to the table, the auto-run being an appreciated accessibility option, and the chain-links add more of a dynamic flair to the combat. But bells and whistles are not enough to justify this.

What isn't ok, is the lack of talk from the devs, no talk about their future plans or responding to our concers. 
They have a discord in which there are tons of people looking for someone to talk to, but there's no one. 
They said it was going to be optimized before hitting the west, that didn't happen. 
The game keeps crashing, I keep getting a white screen and it freezes every fight. I made it to lvl 36 and i'm done.
Don't waste your money on it until they fix these things (If they ever.) 

I'm sad because I am leaving my guild and friends that I made behind, but it's worth it because they are also leaving the game and we'll go back to playing other things. 

Also, it feels like a mobile MMO with the ""Auto walk"" feature. I know it's meant to be there for our longer trips, but the game looks like a phone game. I had max grahpics and the textures were flat. Fps was shit even after I changed the limit in the code from true to false. 

If you want to spend your money on it, go ahead. Just don't go in thinking this is going to solve the problem us gamers are facing in this modern age. Your fun is only going to last so long and then you'll see why people left it.

I will give the following caveats with this recommendation as is defintely in an Early Access state in terms of localization:

- Understand the game is being self published meaning the team working on it is literally ""working on it"" and has limited resources for this port/fewer available than they had with the 3rd party published regions. 

- Do not go in expecting  a 1 to 1 comparison with previously released versions in other regions as it is largely being reworked and translations need to be done to bring over content that was added to the other regions while this was being worked on.

This is NOT an EA, its an Alpha/Beta stage. 

I also want to add, that the fix for the splash screen getting stuck isn't working. If I don't jump in right away I have to restart completely. Steam and Bless aren't properly communicating either. I had to use my local files just to start the launcher. Steam says that it needs to download a patch - but Bless isn't properly responding.

Action-Combat mode was specifically advertised prior to launch, but the only class that actually has it is Berserker. Assassin gear is dropping in dungeons - but its not playable, wtf? 

To seal the deal on all of these issues if that wasn't enough.. Who ever was incharge of translations should probably lose their job. The tutorial isn't even very understandable. I can't even say the word ""mage"" in-game. WTF?! I wrote - ""press the F button"" AND I COULDN""T EVEN SAY BUTT

You don't get off that easy NEOWIZ.

There are many, many, reasons i would like to refund this game.  Firstly, i have ""4.7 hours"" logged in this game which is actually 2.4 hours because the initial 2.3 hours was spent stuck behind an endless loading screen and constant restarts during this games release.  Once I was finally able to get into the game, the server instability became unbearable after only two hours.  The translations to English in this game make it extremely hard to understand and track quests and play, that coupled with the lack of actual Tutorial cause this game to be overly-frustrating.  Finally; the game an MMO, has already had its in-game economy destroyed by an ""Item Dupe"" glitch which is caused by the server-lag/instability and now many of the in-game features have been rendered inoperable, ie: Crafting/Smithing/Gathering/Selling in-game-items.  

The graphics of this game, supposed to be revolutionary, in reality they are using DX9 which is causing even those with beastly computers and GTX 1080's to have low-frame-rate and an experience that is not smooth or graphically enhancing on max settings all the way down to 3 ""standard visual settings"".  

The character creation is nothing revolutionary, IMO there are many other MMO's out there with more options and revolutionary customization than this. 

The game is plagued by horrible server instability (which is not new to new release MMO's with high volume) but this server instability is so bad that you can't even open the map, your inventory, or character progression screens without a 4-8 second delay; and do i have to mention again, an ITEM DUPLICATION GLITCH, which has destroyed the market.

I paid 69.99 for this game, and another very large upset is the fact that this game has been operating so poorly (after 2 days of release)  that the original listings for the game's Delux, Standard, and Collectors edition have been significantly reduced in price and have been ""removed"" and re-listed, negating all of the negative press which was being received in Steam Reviews so people cannot receive an accurate review of the game thus far.",True,1527721357,1527721357,False,1,8,0.499452,True

If you weren't expecting a bumpy ride, you haven't been paying attention to MMO releases over the last decade, no matter whether the game has been out somewhere else for some period of time.  You also haven't been listening to communications from the devs, nor do you understand the reason why an MMO in the process of improvement and iteration would put itself up as an Early Access game, even if it has been out for years.

There are going to be issues.  Not everything will be fixed or changed instantly.  Certain priorities (server stability, dupe exploits) come before others.

An investment into something in Early Access is always a trust exercise.  Will they listen to feedback?  Will they deliver on promises?  Is this a cash grab?  No matter what, if you are going to do this, you will have to accept what it's going to be:  iterative growth over a tangible period of time, with all the bumps that go with overhauling systems.

So the action combat isn't fully implemented for any classes but Berserker (at release).  That probably means it didn't feel quite right and they are trying to iron out some kinks.  This is still a game where you use abilities on targets for some classes, especially Mage.  Or as a Paladin, you are casting heals on targets, not just dropping AoEs that pulse heal.  What if the detection for what you are targeting with the crosshair isn't perfect, and two players/mobs you are trying to target jitter from one to the other?  Or you have a player targeted in OWPvP and he runs behind a mob.  Does your target change to the mob as you track him, ruining your next spell cast and pulling a mob unnecessarily?

Things aren't always as straightforward as people want to think, and it's going to take time to flesh out these updates.  I'm fine admitting that Bless has flaws.  However, I think the game has good bones and I'm satisfied with how on top of things the devs seem after the first couple days from the early release.  I'm invested in what the game could be, and I'm happy enough with what the game is to enjoy the ride, even if it doesn't pan out.

If you are expecting a fully polished experience, your head is in the wrong place, and your expectations won't be met by Bless yet.  And if you are building up your expectations based on marketing hype, one day someone is going to sell you the shirt on your own back.

Come in expecting some bumps, expect to have to do some research/playing around with things to figure your best way through the experience, and I think you'll come out ahead.",True,1527719850,1527719850,True,0,2,0.523810,True

The game also doesn't seem too bad. I mean, in this MMO draught, no one is really waiting for the game that sweeps us off of our feet, but just something to burn some time on. (I JUST WANT SOMETHING WITH A REAL HEALER ROLE, DANG IT, WHY IS EVERYONE TRYING TO PHASE THAT OUT?) So I could keep going, I guess. But why?

There's no end-game content. But okay, games have pulled that before.

Kay. Multiple features or systems I expected are also missing. But okay, some of them I don't mind the absence of (eh, action combat can be fun, but I do prefer tab target style). But so MANY things being different than expectations has me raising an eye... I very much prefer when companies are straight shooters, even if the news is bad.

Okay, so, where I really start to fall apart is the effort put into the game. The translation has us all either cocking eyebrows or squinting really hard at the screen, like staring at it might make it eventually make sense.

As the title states, I have never played Bless in its MANY versions..  And for that I think Im better for it..  WIth coming in to any new (to me) MMO I don't see all the things I've seen before so I can judge it first hand.  

So far I am enjoying the game..  Reminds me of Tera, but better in parts..  Obviously DX9, and UE3 are old systems and the game could use optimization because of it.   It would run so much smoother with DX12..  With the Reddit tweaks it runs better (you can't function without the FOV fix).  Some of the systems are dated a bit, crafting and gathering(as far as gathering the items you gather on the ground is very much Tera with the shiny glow), but they are a tried an true method that works.   I will leave it at this, a article I read about this game stated, it's not ground breaking and it doesnt have the shiny new lustre that other MMO's that are coming out have, but does it need to?  It scratches the itch, and it is fun to play and the devs seems to care, so that's a start.  Updates will tell the story.

There are definitely some issues with it, but MMOs never start out good on launch day so I wasn't surprised by the flaws. Fortunately, Neowiz has actually been listening to the community so far and even released a patch today. At the time of posting this review, they fixed some of the issues with the chat filter. Not all of them, mind you, but they did fix a lot of them. Healing is a little weak right now, potions and Paladin heals are currently not that useful, but they've stated that this is an issue that they're aware of and will fix it. The game can get pretty laggy at times with the low fps, but in my experience it does smooth out.

The combat was satisfying to me (at least on Paladin) and there is a nice amount of weight behind each attack. For example, the 'basic' combo will sound like a solid hit, but nothing earth-shattering, whereas the bigger skills have more weight behind them. The tactics system is fun for me, I can start out in a cc stance and quickly switch over to protection stance, the stance change itself heals me or provides other quick buffs, rewarding me for switching my style.

This game isn't the next great MMO, but it is enjoyable and so far is not p2w at all. In my opinion, if people can get over their disappointment at this very shaky launch, I think they can find a lot of enjoyment in this game.

The combat system is fun, atleast for me. For detailed information i cant say much, because my english isn't good enough to present it in terms it deserves. It is different and you have to get to know it

After the day two fixes and the ini change i have 30-60 fps on ultra with my 1080 Ti. Most issuses where in my opinion through server capacity and login problems.

Im just going to say this take a chill pill folks... most of you are old enough to remember what Diablo 3's release day was like so you should not be surprised. 

Bless online is a game created in Korea-failed, taken to Russia - failed, then brought to Japan - still running, and finally, its here in the US and EU. Gonna say it flat out.. they should have spent more time on translations and fleshing out the quest system... They dropped the ball on this badly. Im guessing they used an auto translate program to save money... bad choice and its hard for them to deny it, because if you do the research yourself, the only way to screw it up as bad as they did is because the translations are wrong. The tutorial for setting up your second stance is a perfect example of this. 

Now am i going to slam the game for these two things? nope. Once i figured things out and went into it I flew.. its is awesome. I love the combat.. I love the combo system. Switching betrween stances on the fly is pretty sweet. The tab targetting is a pain in the butt, however I manually choose my targets anyway so i only tested it for a few minutes to figure out it was junk. 

The mount and pet taming sytem is so amazingly simple.  and you learn it early.. not like most games where you have to wait until a higher level req. and end up slowly running through half the game (WoW for example). Mounts and pets have stamina.. kind of a let down, however they gain level, can be upgraded/improved, and you can recover their stamina by not using them(not leveling) or giving them specific food that cooks can create. This applies to both pets and mounts. Now I am not sure if you can gain benefits from the pets, but You can from the mounts. that is level locked but this isnt surprising. if they gave you everything at the gate it wouldnt be fun.

The graphics are pretty sweet. The land is beautiful to look at and the cities.. I made a loli midget with squirrel ears... she was soo cute. The wife loved her.. anyway i ran that starting story until lvl 9 and when I got off the Air ship and into the town.. well iI wont spoil it but it was worth it.

Simply put there have been changes in the quests and as they continue to work on things the game will flesh itself out... Its worth looking into I think. Its just different enough to make it enjoyable for a while. The guild system is very nice. 

is it a long runner? Well, that depends. Player patience is pretty well inderstood to be severely lacking, so that will damage it. For those who look past the simple issues and find the fixes that us others have found, it should become standardized here soon. I think itll be worth sticking around. Endgame is an unknown to me currently, but I will continue for a while and see where it leads. Hope others dont jump to conclusions because of short sightedness and give the game a try, give it some time.

We were even provided compensation for the server issues over the past 2 days, and I couldn't be more confident with the company. 

The game has a lot of potential. Beautiful world and graphics, interesting storyline and lore, in-depth character creation, crafting and taming features, fluid combat and much more! There is a lot of content on its way soon that we'll get to test out, and everything will continue to be improved upon as time goes on with the help of the playerbase. 
Another key factor about Bless, is that unlike most eastern MMORPGs, Bless is being self-published by the developer themselves. So rather than going through a middle-man like we're used to with western publishers, player-feedback for Bless goes straight to the developer (Neowiz) - which allows for better communication and faster progress. 

If you're interested in a fun, open world Faction vs Faction PvPvE game, and are interested in participating in the development process, give Bless a try. Just do so with patience, and the understanding that this game has been undergoing major rework from its original state since last year. 
However if you don't feel comfortable participating in an Early Access game, I recommend checking back on the game's progress from time to time as it will constantly be changing. I also recommend speaking with players on the Bless-Source community forum, as many people there have had years of experience with the game through playing in other regions.

Taming. You can tame just about anything and either ride them, fly on them, or have them for pets. Want a spawn of Satan as a pet? Done. Want that random turtle as a pet? Done.

Mounts have ""energy"" and once its used up you cant use it again until it gains a little bit of energy back. 


Honestly, Bless Online is a decent MMO. Of course it has problems, but that goes for every MMO. Its launch was a bit bumpy, ill have to agree with people on that but it wasnt that bad. couldve been much MUCH worse. It has potential so don't write it off TOO soon.

Let's go over the game from my eyes after about 45 hours of spending time in the world of Bless.

Graphics are slightly outdated but not in a bad way. I personally think they are beautiful for an older game.

Combat is a little weird to get use to as they left out the crosshair action mode on all classes but one. Currently it's this weird awkward combat trying to be action and tab target at once. Action combat is one of the main things I prefer these days in an MMO. This is really up to each person and what they seek in an MMO and if they prefer a more tab target style or fast paced action. Just the Berserker has the action mode combat right now and it plays quite nicely so I am ok with be patient for the other classes to have this implemented.

Questing is your typical MMO questing. Kill 10 rats, escort some poor lost and scared person, kill 80 orcs, run chores for people, pick some poop up. All that normal questing we are use to. Nothing special. Nothing new. I actually prefer this style of questing as it's pleasing to me to pick up a handful of missions and knock them out and move to the next little area.

Crafting is there and pretty simple but worth doing. There honestly isn't much to say about it. Gathering is about the same. 

Taming is fun! You can tame pretty much anything that isn't a humanoid. You can also level your pet and some will have beneficial stats and you can enhance and upgrade them as well. The same goes for your mounted companion. Oddly, both mount and pet can wear costumes that change what they are so my little hammy up there can be a cat. Weird, right? I won't ask questions.

Cash shop is fine for now. Nothing has overly alarmed me. Cosmetics, mount cosmetics, pet cosmetics, quality of life items like skill reset scroll, teleport scroll, appearance change, character slot, inventory slot, and of the sort.

Guilds need to be leveled in order to gradually accept more members. If you're in a large guild it will take time to get everyone in but if you run a small community it might not be a huge deal for you.

Performance wise the game seems to be having some issues and it isn't a constant problem as it comes and goes for me maybe once or twice a play session but isn't a huge deal breaker. I have also seen you can edit your game file to fix graphics a little better than the options given in game that should help. 

PvP is open world when you hit around level 30 and start seeing the other faction. That is a big deal breaker for some people so please note that. 

I know Bless is getting a lot of heat right now and while it's fair to be concerned I feel like the team really does care. They have done several maintenances per day and patches to fix things. They have compensated players with a healthy amount cash shop currency and do seem to be trying to get the game to a place their players can be happy. 

While I am not trying to defend this game in anyway it was stated that it isn't release and this is a early access period. I think if you are okay with playing an MMO while it's constantly being worked on and improved to the point they can switch it over to full release then $30 is a fair price. I personally paid $70 for a founder's pack and am enjoying the game but would like to stress the point to please not buy this game yet unless you are 100% okay with playing it in an unfinished state. With all that said I am enjoying this game and intend to play for quite a while.

The battle system is very fun, a good enough variety to make it different than just 1,2,3,4 repeat. Not quite as exciting as dragons dogma combat, but much better than a typical MMO. Some of the texts need work. A few spelling and grammar errors here and there but nothing that a person of average intelligence shouldn't be able to figure out, but the voice dialogue is pretty good.

 Ihr gebt dem spiel gar keine chance besser zu werden. Heute muss wohl alles direkt am anfang perfekt. Ich hofe das es trotz dem ganzen hate überlebt und ich noch einige zeit daran spaß haben kann

Mich hat das spiel positiv überrascht, ich hatte aber auch keine so große erwartungen.
Nach dem ich die Trailer und Vidios gesehen hatte dachte ich erst na ja sieht das langweilig aus,
doch dan am Headstrart wollte ich Bless eine chance geben. Die Garfik ist besser als in den meisten mmorpg ( Nur BOD finde ich besser).
Das Kampfsystem (Tab Targeting) ist interessant  zwar ein wenig Gewöhnungsbedürftig mit vielen möglichkeiten.
Die Quests sind nicht schlecht hauptsächlich so wie in anderen mmos. Das Farming und Crafting ist jetzt auch nichts neues, was ich aber gut finde ist das man alle monster als Mount oder Pet zähmen kann.
Gut das spiel hatt einige problemme beim start die Performenc bricht gelegentlich ein und die server leggen manschmal  und es startet nicht immer. Doch es hatt mich nicht davon abghalten es weiter zu spielen irgendwie hat es mir es angentan.

First off, people complaining of no end game, and a bad release clearly did not pay attention to any of the previous press releases Neowiz was doing. I went into this expecting a buggy not fully completed game with some end game dungeons and some pvp. I did not expect a full release and they shouldn't have either. 

It was clearly stated that the game was going to be EA with content updates every month and big releases every 3 months up until a full release after 1 year - 1 year 6 months. **If you expected this game to be anything else, you didn't read very well.** Neowiz clearly has stated the content that would be avail in EA: Dungeons, PVP, Taming. The only thing that I didn't expect was the no action combat system, which was a disappointment but I'd rather they release a great action system when it's ready rather than a meh one as they stated it was not completely up to their standards.

Pros:
- Decent Cutscenes and Voice acting
- Story is better than most others I've seen
- Combat feels heavy and engaging, the new system has made me feel like my skills actually hit hard and the new combo system is very good
- Graphics are pretty(Regarding FPS issues, after the INI fixes I have not been lagging at all)
- Character Customization is very detailed and it definitely took up a fair amount of time to get the right look
- Cash shop is not pay to win and the currency exchange seems to be fair (DP and Honor to Lumena)
- Dungeons are fun and the party buff system is quite nice
(AS of this I am level 32 mage and have not engaged in too much PvP)
Cons:
- You will need to tweak INI yourself as in game you cannot uncap your FPS etc...
- Balance is definitely an issue from what I hear at end game
- Translation issues ( This will be addressed most likely soon and honestly isn't too much of a big deal for me)
- Needs a more straight forward guide system to certain systems

With all that being said, I believe Bless Online will continue to grow for the better when they start releasing more content, implement the new system of action combat, and continue to improve the game over the course to release.

I reccomend this to anyone looking towards the future of Bless and not to people looking for a full experience at this moment. If you don't like the game, you can refund and that is perfectly fine. However, in the future months to come, please look to Bless and potentially think about coming back when the game gets more developed.",True,1527714751,1527714751,True,0,0,0.000000,True

They got way more customers then they expected which is a great thing, so the servers were overloaded and they have been addressing that. You absolutely have to do some changes to the .ini to make it great and playable which is odd especially for someone unused to that sort of thing like myself, but the community have provided easy to follow guides on how to do this and its all been smooth sailing since. 

The game itself is great looking, especially since its running on DX9 which is a bit behind the times but looks great nonetheless and doesnt bother me and shouldnt be a deciding factor. 

With the .ini fixes, the game runs smoothly and I get 80+ FPS on max settings on a 4 year old system in all the major areas.

It's inbetween for me, first off the launch was terrible.
Could not play on the first day, and it still has issues with the Spash screen, 
*Witch forces you to restart until you finally get past it takes 3-5 restarts if you are unlucky*

The game looks great, and has voice acting in it more then I expected.
But skills are badly explained and you have to figgure it out by trail and error, not giving you any real feedback about what the skill does can be really anoying for new players.
Also you as far as I know you can't rearagne the skills how you desire.

Gathering is a pain, if you want to craft and gather your own mats. you better get ready to spend days looking for the mats you need as for each matirial node on the map you only get 1 unit, *You find iron you get 1* same for all the other mats I found so far in the game, this needs to be reworked, Else crafting will become a pain. 
(atleast give us 3 mats per matirial node)

Combat right now is rather repeditive as you will most likley use the same skill combo all the time, press 1 then pres two times, to compete the combo. you can do difrent onces but it does not feel any difrent.

I think this game has great potantial, but it needs some fixes. I suggest you wait a while before buying this game to see

0,130,5,5371,5371,76561198035755409,2,spanish,False,42391526,"[b]TL;DR: El juego tiene cosas que mejorar, y ha tenido un comienzo duro, pero es entretenido, está mejorando y parece que los desarrolladores escuchan y tienen ganas de que salga bien.[/b]

El juego no está tan mal como muchos dicen. ¿El rendimiento es pésimo en ocasiones? Sí, pero puede ser minimizado mediante un par de cambios en los archivos de configuración (logrando hasta más 100 fps sin reducir la calidad gráfica, ya que son cosas como hacer que el motor use más de un núcleo de la CPU), que no lleva más de 2 minutos hacer, y además los desarrolladores ya están trabajando en resolverlo, siendo esta su máxima prioridad solo por detrás de solucionar el bug del duplicado de objetos. Otros errores como el problema de la pantalla de carga que ocurría muchas veces, ya han sido solucionados.

Veo también que muchos se quejan de la falta de clases o contenido, incluyendo el end-game, pero esto es algo que ya se sabía. Por algo el juego está en Acceso Anticipado, ya que quieren ir metiendo las cosas de forma escalonada (sabemos que pretenden empezar a introducir cosas como el PvP de 15vs15 y más mazmorras de nivel alto en una o dos semanas, con más cosas a la vuelta de la esquina) para no encontrarse con mil bugs de golpe. Quien se queja de esto no se había informado bien, puesto que los desarrolladores han sido sinceros en ese sentido. Aún y así, se han disculpado por la decepción que estos jugadores se han llevado. Mientras tanto hay bastante por hacer si uno se lo toma con calma: una historia más o menos decente (para ser un MMO), artesanía, recolección, incluso puedes domar casi cualquier criatura o montruo que veas por ahí y tenerlo como montura, mascota, o compañero de aventuras. O liarte a tortas con quien veas por ahí y que sea de la otra facción.

Otro punto a tener en cuenta es los problemas con los servidores que ha habido este par de días que los 'Founders' hemos podido jugar por adelantado. Es cierto, ha habido lag y mantenimiento, pero ahora mismo los servidores van perfectos, y se han ido abriendo más cada día para poder reducir las colas. Aún y así, debido a las molestias ocasionadas y que en parte han sido su culpa por falta de previsión (podrían haber abierto las compras para reservas de cara a tener una idea más aproximada del número de jugadores que iba a haber), se nos ha compensado con el equivalente a 17,29€ en monedas de juego (2450 lumena).

En cuanto al P2W (Pay to Win), si alguno se lo pregunta, no hay nada similar. Lo que hay a la venta actualmente no son más que cosméticos (skins y kit de cambio de aspecto, por ejemplo) y consumibles tipo +20% exp (que no es que haga falta, se sube de nivel super fácil). Y todo se puede conseguir jugando, también, ya que se puede cambiar diariamente moneda de las actividades por cierta cantidad de lumena, que es la moneda de la tienda (pero no al revés, si a alguien le preocupa). Los desarrolladores ya han dicho que quieren evitar el P2W y pretenden monetizar el juego solo con skins guays y cosas así. Sé que en el Black Desert dijeron lo mismo en su momento y luego cambió, pero aquí por ahora, por lo que están haciendo, da la sensación de que están siendo honestos.

Respecto a las mecánicas, y más allá de lo que ya he comentado de poder domar criaturas y tal, el combate por ejemplo es decente. Sí, la cámara de acción todavía no está habilitada para todas las clases (aunque lo estará), pero aún y así está bastante bien. Si habéis jugado al Tera es bastante similar en su sistema de combos, y parece tener bastante personalización en cuanto a habilidades (mejorando de un modo u otro las que más te interesan) y pasivas a elegir (que hay ""unas cuantas"").

Y qué decir del sistema de creación de personaje. Puedes cambiar prácticamente todo lo que quieras del mismo, y tener el personaje tal y como lo habías imaginado (podría decir que va a la par al del Black Desert). Además hay bastantes opciones en peinados, maquillaje y pinturas, tatuajes, cicatrices y marcas, etc. Y si eres de los que no se les da bien crear a su personaje, tienes una gran variedad de modelos ya hechos donde elegir, pudiendo elegir uno de ellos al completo, o mezclar cuerpo y cabeza como desees.

Resumiendo, si queréis probarlo y estáis dispuestos a tener la paciencia que todo juego en Acceso Anticipado requiere para ver cómo van añadiendo más cosas y puliendo todo poco a poco, es un juego recomendable hoy por hoy.

Bless Online Pros:
1. Amazing graphics that make you feel like you are apart of the game.
2. Fast combat that is nowhere close to boring.
3. Pet/mount taming system!
4. Great character creation.
5. Perfect soundtrack.
6. Pretty interesting storyline.
7. Certain alliances lock depending on if there is to much of it (keeping things balanced)

Bless Online Cons:
1. Lack of optimization.
2. FPS lock
3. Race/class lock
4. Weird translation
5. Servers lock when full

---Information About Pros/Cons---
Okay I want to start out and say the graphics in this game are great! So great you might run into some FPS problems if you don't have a high end PC, even then it caps you at 62 FPS which there is a fix for! I went from 62 FPS to 300+ with max graphics. The combat feels slow at low levels but when you are starting to level up and actually get chain skills the combat speeds up a lot there is so much different things you can do in combat from jumping/dodging/running/kiting/hiding etc. Let's not forget you can tame your own mount & your own pet, granted it does take a little bit of skill pressing that space bar perfectly fast enough so the monster doesn't kill you. The character creation is great tbh I feel like it's better than BDO. They do have a thing where if there is to many union or to many Heiron a player cannot pick that alliance so it's great for keeping the population balanced! Now some classes are race/class locked like your big furry can't be a magic caster (mainly due to lore) I listed it as a con but tbh it could be either if you like the lore in the games you play. 
Overall the game is a great game, it brings a lot of new things to the table. Is it the savior of the MMORPG genre? Who know? No one knows the future.

-Duplication bug that existed in the previous version of the game
-Machine translated english despite saying they were almost finished before launch
-Free2Play microtransaction in a Buy2Play game
-Poor skill balance 
-Everyone have insane damage output which trivialize the game's content

1. The Graphics are on par with archage or other games of the time.

2. Has a extinsive character creation I spent well over an hour creating my character with all the sliders and different options. 

3. They finally fixed the splash screen issue that was plaguing the first two days so far on the third day as I write this review I havnt had to restart my computer. 

4. You can solo most dungeons I can with a ranger just got to take it slow "" and not get stuck on a wall while kitting""

Cons.

1. No action combat except for beserk , feels like playing twister on my keyboard while playing a ranger.

2. The lumina is bound to the character not to the account so if you claim it and switch to a different toon you can't use buy anything in cash shop. ( I have looked on the discussions and they said that they are looking ""into it"" ) I realy hope they are because that is a big killer for some people. 

3. Costs lumina to res if you dont want to run back, and to teleport back if you alrdy used your teleport stone.

4. Some of the items in the cash shop are so expensive you might as well avoid it all togeather.

5. This is more so because it is on UR3 but most MMO's build thier game engines to handle heavy populations. Some people had to optimise their game so it could be playable in some cases and did some ini work.

6. In my opinion the story is bland feels generic some people may like it but it just ant my cup of tea.  

7. As of this review the higher players are complaining about no endgame content (well if you can max lv in two days then this MMO is a little to easy then).

8. They nerfed the dps for all the classes in the June 1st update making the game slow and almost unplayable in some cases 

Overall

It needs severe debugging, a couple of patches, a lot of polish and to provide to content that they said they were. In the state that it is in and how MMO players are and what we are used to playing I would give it a few months before buying, or atleast wait untill it goes on sale or F2P.",False,1527711112,1527887027,False,0,1,0.448276,True

These same people have commended Neowiz for their transparency and now act as though the community hasn't been mislead. The content was assumed to be there and Neowiz purposely left it out of its showcase knowing that it wasn't. You can't commend a company for its openness and excuse them for not stating that content will be missing, to be rolled out at a later date, that they held off from saying such proves their unreliability.
Further still, the only real change to NA version is the combat system which. True action combat is missing (and by that I mean Tera or even BnS style type targeting), item duping is a known issue on every other region and surprise - it's on NA too. You can say this'll be fixed, but the only way to remove such items now would be a wipe, and since that's not happening the economy is already screwed and it's only day 2. There was a 6 page summary on how to do it, so for those saying it's not wide spread, it really is.

I'm more disappointed with the communities divisiveness, people attacking others for stating facts, because neutrality only exists in the absence of objectivity to some people.

Just because this is a early access doesn't excuse all of the flaws the game has when they've had 6-7 years to perfect the game. It's a cash grab of the worst kind, they couldn't even deliver a game to then turn it into P2W after a few months like other Korean MMOs we've had Westernised. I'm not sure what mode of lie I prefer more.

Performance:
First off, the game lags like an old grandma in open world, no matter how good your system's hardware is. Needless to say, there are many optimization tweaks floating around the internet that improve the game, but sacrifice its looks for better performance. In dungeons, the solo experience has been largely well for myself, with my framerate hitting upwards of 120 fps stable.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is quite fun, being a hybrid of action mmos and traditional mmos. The biggest issue, is that the implementation of action combat is not in the game for all classes, and currently only the berserker class has the option of action combat. That being said, the prospect of action combat with the other classes is going to be amazing and fantastic, provided the release comes in a timely manner.

The game has standard dungeons, a typical gearing system with durability, and a player economy minus trading. Gear is primarily obtained through dungeons (so far via my leveling experience) and open world mobs tend to drop gear as well as uncommon drops. Most early game dungeons can be soloed for experience, but later dungeons require a team. Speaking on the dungeon experience, there is NO auto matchmaker to find parties for dungeons. This by far is the biggest gameplay con.

Community:
So far the new community has been helpful, though the highly restrictive chat filter seems to take the fun out of the social aspect.

Overall Experience:
Overall, I'd have to say that the game feels as if its in its infancy. Compared to more polished and seasoned games such as Black Desert, WoW, and FFXIV, the game claims its own identity role being a hybrid action-tab target MMO. If the developers keep up with the updates, content, and fix the performance issues on higher end machines, the game could be a stunning and wonderful to play within 6 months. However, hope alone is not often a selling point for MMOs and only time will tell. Will the devs pull a FFXIV and rise the game to glory? Or will they pull a TERA Online and forsake the community for years to come whilst using them as a cash cow?

So far, the game is a solid 5.5/10 in my book. Just enough to get an upvote rather than a downvote.

So far it does not seem pay to win, they do offer a premium membership feature though it seems okay. Currently it is lacking action combat, has a very agressive chat filter and is a little bit rough on telling you how to do certain things.

After an hour of opening and closing the game just to get to server select, when it finally let me in, the server my friends were on had character creation disabled. 

So I made one on another server, only to discover for seemingly no reason, the race I wanted to be could not also be the class I wanted to be.

When I finally got in the game proper... it's just... okay? 
The combat isn't unique. It's just showing you what your rotation is instead of having all the abilities on the bar.
The world is boring. It doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done by every other Asian MMO.
The dialogue and voice acting is bad. At some point you'd think the english voice actors would've had the integrity to mention that people don't talk like that. But hey, money is money amirite.

Millet oyuncu yok diye ağlar mmorpg lerde, siz bu oyunun dolu olması dolayısıyle patladığından şikayet ediyorsunuz.

Bilgisi olmayanlara oyunun hype lanıp neden olumsuz inceleme yağmuruna tutulduğunu özetleyeyim,    Oyuna 2 gün erken başlamak için paket satın alanlar bu 2 günlük avantajı elde edemediler çünkü girişte ve oyun içerisinde dize sorun yaşadılar.  Oyun içerisinde şehirlerde özellikle (yüklemede) kaynaklanan bir problem var, yani senin 1080 kart kullanman yahut  950m kullanmadn değildi  sorun ve servera yüklenmenin de neticesiyle serverlar partladı giriş bile yapamadı oyuncular 1/20 gibi komik bir rakam çıktı ortaya.

Gtx 760 Kartı olan arkadaşım da abi sorunsuz bir şekilde oynuyorum sadece fps drop oluyor ve bu da her mmorpg başlangıcında olmuştur dedi.  Aynı şekilde  970 kartı olan arkadaşım da   Yoğunluk geçtiği vakit (Gece 2 den sonra)  Bölgeye göre  60-150 fps arası değiştiğini söylüyor.   Sistem gereksinimleri minimum gereksinimlerini bile karşılamayan yine işlemci, ekran kartı olarak bir tık altında olan yakın arkadaşımla şuan beraber hala oynamaktayız düşük ayarlarda gayet sıkıntısız oyunu oynuyor.

Perhaps it was too much to ask for to check the game for bugs and exploits before launching it in NA/EU. I was very understanding when it came to server lag and optimizations which were and still are an issue in this game and honestly I can live with the lag and disconnects.  
The thing that made me quit and attempt a refund is that THERE IS A DUPLICATION ITEM EXPLOIT.
I would've continued to play the game or at least attempt, although about 90% of the time I've been online has been stuck on loading screen I had hope that these issues can be solved and the game can be fun.
However, today I learned and saw videos of people duplicating items. This destroys the economy of the game completely and I'm frankly disappointed because Neowiz knew about this glitch in the JP version and still didn't do anything about it.

It's frankly a scam to claim that the game has been reworked and launch it with an exploit that destroys the economy of the game. For somebody like me who loves building on materials and in-game currency and playing the market of the game, this makes the game completely SH*T.

Honestly. Do not buy. The only way to fix the economy of the game right now is to wipe the game but even at that there is a long list of stuff that are not working and need to be fixed.

1) The game looks like a mobile game that was developed for PC. When you target an NPC the green aura is so poorly made that you can count the little boxes. 
2) The translations are terrible. It's hard to understand what your skills do it's as if I'm playing a Japanese version of the game with an English patch.
3) Optimization has to be done. Even after the recent patch/fix the fps drops and the game freezes when you open any window.
4) The market window is completely ridiculous it looks as if you pulled a browser in the game looks so out of place...
5) The combat system is far from being action combat it's more like spamming a button and hoping that your skill will go off in the next 2 seconds. There is a delay when you try to cast a skill/combo.
6) The crafting system is unclear, there are no explanations whatsoever.
7) After playing for a while I still couldn't find the ""Wheat"" for the gathering quest like seriously... 
8) The Party Matching System does not work or if it does hell how am I supposed to know when I've found a party?
9) Guessing is 90% of the game
10) Apparently, there is no end-game released for NA, leveling is super easy and once you reach 45 there is absolutely nothing for you to do other than ganking the enemy faction which could be fun but then again ...
11) Cannot create characters in the servers where my friends are thus I can't play with them

The list can go on and to be honest but I don't feel like wasting my time anymore. I gave it a try and I'm greatly disappointed. 
If you have the game I suggest you get a refund if you don't, don't buy it.

[i]Dejo en claro que esta es mi opinión. Trato de ser lo más objetiva e imparcial que pueda ser.

Es sólo un lanzamiento previo que pude durar 3 , 6 meses o más.

1º.- Gráficos/Optimización: yo soy de la vieja escuela, a los que le importa más jugar que preocuparse por buenos gráficos, obviamente si los tienen es un plus. Los del Bless no son lo mejor de lo mejor, pero tiene unos gráficos muy aceptables. No es comparable a otros juegos como BDO (al que he jugado) . Sobre la optimización no puedo opinar, mi ordenador tiene más de 3 años y el juego me va muy fluido, sin bajones extraños de fps, al menos por el momento.. No es una maquina bestial, pero va bien.

Puntuación Personal: 7/10

2º.- Combate/Action Combat: Tratan de crear un sistema nuevo de combate a partir de combos, al principio es algo lioso pero te acabas acostumbrando. Aunque por lo que se ve no se han alejado mucho del estilo clasico, lo que si le han dado algo dinamismo con lo de los combos. Por desgracia deshabilitaron el AC para algunas clases, bueno, para todas a excepción del Berserker. Neowiz dejó en claro en su momento este cambio, y dijo que más adelante se podría volver a incluir en el resto de clases. Asi que no le veo tanto problema a eso.

También tienen que hacer unos arreglos generales con los Stats de las clases. Al parecer el daño que se realiza y recibe es mayor que las curas medias que pueden hacer los Paladines. Por lo tanto esta desbalanceado un poco el juego, por suerte ya han dicho que se pondrán con ello.

Puntuación Personal: 9/10

Hay más cosas que opinar pero por desgracia, me he dedicado más a farmear y a sacar equipo que a subir de nivel XD. Así que no puedo opinar por el contenido End Game, aunque parece ser que no hay mucho. Más que nada porque el contenido se irá añadiendo conforme pase el tiempo en la Early Access. Ya que esa es su finalidad. 

Ahora, sobre los problemas que se dieron los 2 primeros dias, he aqui mi opinión.

Primer Día: Como es habitual, el juego inició para mi sin problema alguno. Eso si, sólo 1 server o 2, al comienzo. Mala idea. Se llenaron los servers en un momento. no tardaron mucho en añadir otros servidores, un par de horas quizas, tras uno o dos mantenimientos. 

Como dije el primer dia hubieron varios mantenimientos para incluir server, mejorar el rendimiento, y evitar el lag. hubo colas en los servers de hasta 2000 personas. Y se empezó a notar un fallo en algunos, que hacia que te estancaras en el logo de Bless al abrir el cliente.

Según mi opinión, un inicio de juego como otro cualquiera.

[b]Segundo Dia:[/b] El inicio fue normal, en este momento empecé a notar el fallo de estancarse en el logo, hasta media tarde en que se comenzó a notar un fuerte delay en las acciones comunes del juego. Loot, Compra y Venta, Aceptación de Misiones, etc. A excepción del lag y del problema del login, no noté nada más. Tardaron en reaccionar pero en cuanto lo hicieron no tardaron mucho en corregirlo.

Tercer Día: Fallos comunes y por fin aplicaron un parche para corregir el fallo del login. Por el resto ninguna novedad.

Según mi opinión y experiencia es un inicio normal como otro cualquiera. Habrá que dar tiempo para que se arreglen muchos errores que se han mencionado durante estos dias. Añadir nuevo contenido y además buscar soluciones para los problemas de optimización que algunas personas tiene. Peor inicio tuvo el FFXIV y a dia de hoy es uno de los mejores MMORPG que hay en el mercado.

I am usually the guy sticking up for poor MMO launches but this is by far and away the worst MMO launch ive been part of. And ive been playing these things for 15 years. I can handle the low response servers from to many players logging in but this game is jkust fundementally broken.

- Translation is poor for western release
- Games performance is by far the worst ive ever experienced ( no i should not be editing ini files for my 1080ti to run the game or setting my graphical settings to low)
- Native resolution has to be set before you enter game
- Splash screen loading bug that means you can not get in for 80% of the time you try
- Action combat removed from nearly all classes
- UI can not be rescaled at all
- diabolical interface
- Telegraphed combat locks you in place

Spent over an hour fighting with the infinite splash loading screen
Finally get to the server list to queue
Servers immediately go down for maintenance for an hour
Came back and queued up for the server my friends are on
Walked my dog
Made dinner
Watch a few episodes of DBZ 
2.5 hours go by, finally <1000 in queue
Tanara server is unavailable, you have been disconnected
Back to 2000+ in queue
Go to another server to save appearances for my characters
Go to sleep

Early Access Day 2: 
Still getting the infinite splash loading screen
Try multiple times to get through
Character creation on Tanara no longer available
Decide to make some more appearances for characters and wait to see if I can play on the same server as my friends
Constantly get disconnected within 30s of getting to the server screen/character creation screen so I can't even do that
Finally get in on another server so I can at least try playing the game I paid for
Laggy, jittery gameplay 
Need to follow some reddit post guide on tweaking a bunch of settings in the ini files to get the game to run better because apparently the reddit game development team of random posters on the internet are better than this game's developers

In sum:

Couldn't get on in time to make a character on the server with my friends because of an infinite loading screen bug
Character creation on that server is now locked indefinitely
Couldn't even make a character on another server because I get disconnected within 30s of loading up the game for half of the next day

There are alot of things that did not work for the 2 day head start, and for the price it is VERY understandable why people are upset. I would be too. People could not log in at all for the 2-day head start (My sister being one of them) So I reserved names she and my friends wanted until they could join. 
With that being said, I had none of the issues these people have experienced except for the server disconnects for mainantence and some FPS issues. 

This game has failed before. Yes, the company should have had the 2 day headstart in the bag. No excuses, beta or alpha it doesn't matter. It feels like where it failed, they left it there and finally are dusting it off for another go-at-it.

Graphically, it feels behind.
 The characters don't really feel alive, it's your typical asian MMO. The characters are stiff and it's hard to fall into the mood of whats going on (Like if npcs are dying, there are other NPCs standing around and talking calmly.) Much like Tera.
The animal/furry races have long ears but they don't shift. It's like wearing a headband with ears. There is no idle animation, just your character breathing and staring blankly.
The world itself, is kind of bland similar to Dragons Dogma. Look at Guild Wars 2 and Black Desert then come back to Bless; simple things need to be added like foliage, just an overhaul of retextures and animations.
The text and word translation isn't 100%
Some of the walk/run character movement is very ridged.

Cash-Shop/Ingame Currency:
There is a character bound limit to when you purchase the ingame currency (Lumena I think it's called.) But it will be changed to account bound.
The combat, I'm indifferent to. It's tab targeting and you can combo but it feels clunky and there is a half second delay to skills sometimes. The UI cannot be scaled (Yet) to be made smaller or move anything around. The camera angles are strange. 
Character creator is good, better than some MMO's but is lacking in some options. (Most asian MMO's ignore different races like black, asian *ironically*) **Except Black Desert**. 
In Bless, They all look like dolls/ statues or mannequins. 

There really is no ""help"" function for new players yet because at a certain level, your story questing seems to stop but picks back up 2 levels later and black desert is like that which can be very confusing and off putting. 
As far as I can tell there is no real endgame yet. Much like GW2.
All these things can be fixed and improved, these are elements to MMO's I care about.

It's not the end.

There are beautiful aspects of this game. You can literally see the potential. When you create your character and enter the game, the opening scene is something dramatic depending on your starter race and faction; It does draw you in. You can literally just about tame and ride anything ingame.

The company wants to make this game better, and giving helpful feedback is the way it goes.

I like playing early access, the game is simple for now. Slower paced. I think for everyone really curious about this game even looking through negative reviews wait several months for more to come out.
There are people playing Bless right now and loving it. I do recommend this game, but for later. I will support this game now because I want to see it succeed. 
There is alot of positivity ingame.
People are recruiting for dungeons/ guilds/ pvp and pve questing and helping each other. It is alive and kicking, very bruised but still going.

I'm not saying ignore the negative reviews but there are more people supporting this game still than the negative. Generally, one negative review can shatter a persons opinion and outweighs the positive. There are ALOT of negative reviews and there is a video on youtube about why you should not play Bless and I do recommend watching it.

In my opinion this is a bad launch but certainly not the worst in MMO history. 
I do enjoy so far what this game offers.
I have been apart in terrible launches and this is a walk in the park as far as that goes.
It's early access and people forget what it means. I have hope for this game and look forward to the future of it.

0,142,3,348,348,76561198013811183,0,english,False,42389018,"It's sad to say I will be returning this game. I had some hopes for it to keep me occupied in the MMO scene but alas it failed. The game feels like it should of been ported to my cell phone rather than an outright computer game. The optimization is terrible even with my higher end computer. I still had framerate stutters with the graphics turned super low and the game itself isn't a marvel to look at. The saving grace for this game was supposed to be it's revamped combat system but all they did was make this pseudo action, tab target, and combo system which was indeed different. 

Pros:
The new-ish combat system- Really this is the only thing i'd take away from this game as being half positive. Key word, half, as it will also be in my cons list. It was entertaining as a Warrior to use the big axe and switch between single target and AoE combos but the initial key placement for those combos were the keys R, T, and Y which felt a bit off but whatever. I use an orbweaver and can rebind those to fit better. 

Story?- Kind of? As a thundercat I thought it was cool that you were a noname warrior who worked it way up within a matter of seconds only to have it stripped away due to your origins. I'll leave it as vague as that since I don't want to spoil it for people who want to play the game. Afterwards you head into the open lower level city and do quest after quest with Don Chico <-- Loved the name btw and his blacksmith friend Morte. The blacksmith is a badass and the story seemed like it was going in an interesting direction but I can't comment much further as the rest of the game made me simply not want to play it.

Cons: 

Poor Optimization- By god I thought in 2018 game creators would get this right. It felt like playing PubG or early Rust all over again with the random framerate stutters and the random graphical lag in fights. The game is a simple port from it's Japanese counterpart which had the same problem so for me it doesn't look like they've done anything to help the issue.

Poor Graphics- This one doesn't affect me as much as I care more about gameplay and story (Shit I played SWTOR for a long time because of the story and the graphics are terrible) but they are trying to sell a fantasy world that looks like . EVERY... OTHER...FANTASY...WORLD. Not to mention a poor representation of them as well. Running through the beginner city (I forgot the name) felt like going through a Ps2 title game and that's pushing it.

Taming system/Mount system - I thought I was going to have a bit of fun with the whole getting my own pets and mount thing. Lord was I surprised when found this random and not so fun mini game I had tot play in order to get these. Space bar, space bar, space bar. Hit the green area with your spacebar! Fun, no? No. Again this felt like dated and boring so after taming a bee and a wolf I was quite done with it. Now onto the mount system or should I say the Energy system for it. Get rid of it. It's pointless and doesn't belong as i'm sure you'll be able to purchase that feed both in game and on your online marketplace. It doesn't matter, it ruins the games pace early on.

The combat system- Oh yes this one goes here as well. Remember how I said I liked it because it was different? Yeah that's the only  thing I liked about it. It was rushed because they had to redo the system before launch which left it clunky. The resposne time for the keys you have to use from the time you press them to the time they are initiated is delayed and makes the whole thing feel off. They could of done something great here but chose to do...whatever this is.

Auto pathing- The bane of my goddamn existence when it comes to MMO's and it REALLY sold me that this should of been a mobile mmo. Why? It makes your playerbase lazy and doesn't encourage exploration, not that you gave them much to be wow'd  by in terms of exploration anyway. Felt like I was playing a poorly optimized Lineage 2 with worse graphics.

I want the ability to make my own action bar and put thogether skills and skill chains to how I see fit.

Also the tooltips for the skills are so bad.  You cant tell how much a skills is going to cost ur resource pool like it literally says 15% + 32 mana OK let me bust out the calaculator to see if I have enough to pull off this skill chain.  The are very vague as well almost like they didnt even try like they had the intern do the day before launch at 2am.

the optimizations is poor but honestly i can live with that but i cant get over the terrible combat system.  which honestly doesnt seem bad at first until u reach about level 10-13 when you have to start doing the hunt quest to get the exp for the next main quest and u have to kill the same monster 60-74 times and realize ive just been hitting the same 3 buttons for the last 2 hrs it really starts to sink in.

My rig is a Digital Storms Vanquish 7- level 2
6 core 3.2 ghz with 8 ram and 1060 gtx 
i didnt have any issues running at all

The combat is as you should know by now, Tab targeting however it has procs for combos which i found be really cool
character creation was decent and had allot options although i didnt spend to much time playing with them
Questing is very simple and nothing worth saying positive or negitive about although the main story line is pretty good and i found the voice acting better then what i was especting.
the armors and weapons i have manage unlock as of this time were not really stylish to me but were not recolors apon recolors although i did get a dark version of my starter gear at some point
the maps were ok and the enemys were actually to be feared i die a few times there also some good attack animations

the world looks pretty low grade like even the basic tarrain was not very good i look pass it sense its just the tarrain but it was very unimersive this of course can be fixed over time as the devs work out the graphics and optimize the game

Is it a terriable game? Eh. Its nothing special. There isn't anything ground breaking or anything like that. The game does have its posititves, few as they are. So let break down the pros and cons.

PROS:
- It is fun. I played it for about 2.5 -ish hours (started late and I was tired) and I did enjoy my time. 
- you can tame pretty much everything as a pet or mount
- not p2w. Some will argue that the xp potions in the shop are but you can get the same bonuses from pets for free. 
- graphics aren't groundbreaking but they are nice. 
-pvp is open world beftween factions. There is also an arena option (not in game yet) for pvp as well. To the best of my understanding you can't pvp people in the same faction as you. 


CONS:
- Lot of performance issues. Mostly first day release growing pains but damn it is still annoying. With that said I still wouldn't give the devs a pass on that since this game has been out for years in other regions and they are still having those issue. Easy fix is turn settings down as low as they can go. Still looks passable.
         - screen skips, bad fps in towns, delays when trying to bring up menus, translation issues, graphical glitches, etc.
- Tutorial takes forever. 
- Camera is absolute shit. Most MMOS you move the mouse and the camera moves with you (BDO for example). In this game you need to hold RMB the entire time.

Subjective:
 -combat feels clunky. It is tab targeting. Pure and simple. This hybrid nonsense others are claiming is bull. Wit the exception of the berserker class I am told. Also the way the combo system works takes some getting used to and is not very responsive. Dodging doesnt exsist. If you are used to action style combat this will take some getting used to.

I have combat as subjective because there are others who say it is great and works fine. So I am chalking this oone up to me just not being used to this style. 

Overall the game has potential. The devs are scrambling to fix these issues (working on perofrmance right now with the other issues I mentioned also on the agenda after performance). I would not say the game is worth its current price but definitley keep an eye on this one in the coming weeks. Despite these issues, I did enjoy my time in game.

Bless has all of the standard bells and whistles of any modern MMO, but gives the player a huge amount of choice in their ability to build their character (both stylistically and skill-wise). Character creation is one of the most intuitive and nitty-gritty I've seen with a wide variety of presets and the ability to change just about anything. The skill tree is broken up into ""tactics"" and tactics contain chains of skills that the player can choose from when initiating an attack. The player can only have a set amount of tactics equipped at a time, so choose carefully for the situation you think you'll be in! In additon to tactics, players are granted stand-alone skills that enhance their abilities and create a further sense of customization. Even still, you're able to choose a tree or two of passives that will enhance your characters gameplay. This is such a refreshing change from MMOs that allow players to equip ALL of the skills ALL of the time and PvP is basically just a face-roll fest on the keyboard. Bless combat requires skill, choice, foresight and a bit of luck.

Obviously the game isn't completely done, and a lot of early access reviews are fairly harsh in their critique.

Also, if you didn't know this... this is not the commerical release :^) you guys are crapping allover a really, really great game.

Here are the pros within the game:
- Good character creation.
- Great story (I play Hieron, so I can't say for Union).
- Diverse community (no one is sticking to one race/class).
- Beautiful European style cities/towns.
- Armor/weapons look badass!
- Professions actually seem good and are easy to get into (also, everyone can gather).
- Taming system (if you can't own a creature as a pet, you can ride it as a mount).
- Very large map (would probably take hours to walk across the whole thing).
- Tactics and abilities are quite detailed, you can build into certain trees if you want, while staying away from others (I haven't placed any points in and still nuke things as a Paladin).
- You can get cash shop currency just by playing the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- Dungeons are soloable.
- You get perks from being in a PARTY! WHAT!
- Hunt Quest system allows for easy leveling, and is a perfect test setting for new moves.
- Main story quests and misc quests are interesting, and don't usually have kill requirements.
- PvPvE FOCUS! FINALLY!

Here are the cons within the game:
- Some dumb translations, biggest example was in the tutorial.
- Some cinematics voice acting doesn't come in until the dialogue has already passed... I am sure this is just a bug.
- Faction and Help chat are full of flamers that hate on the game... but are still playing it???
- Not every race can be every class :(

I just refunded... and let me tell you why...
(Note: I read the apology letter from the Exec Producer, was touched, but not convinced)

1. Artifical Economy - Why are you capping min and max price ranges on items in the AH? I feel like this is a laaaaazzzy way of trying to stop botters and cheaters. Like come on now...

2. Web browser AH - Why is the auction house a damn browser?!!?

3. No end game content  - self explanatory, although the executive producer did mention something in his apology letter about all the real stuff will come in 1-2weeks?? well maybe you shouldnt have launched yet. Getting pushed back is better than this fiasco right now.

4. Feeling like a MOBILE MMO GAME - So i played ""Crusaders of Light"" and it feel Bless online gave me the that exact feeling. except with better 2012 pc graphics.  Auto run to quests that auto run to you an area. then you are given a vague mistranslated detail on how to complete your quest.  

5. Pay to win - Right now there is some pay for convenience aspect of the game going on such as using RL money to buy gems that give you teleportation to certain dungeons, etc. Nothing major but this just opens the door for more P2W stuff.

6. Delay in combat - To be honest, I really like the combat.  It was fun trying to combo these spells together into creative spell chains.  BUT it was so clunky and felt delaaaaayeeeedddd... Whenever I would hit my stance conversion and try to cast a follow up spell, often the game was running so poorly that I would miss the follow up spell.  I would constanly spam and check for a confirmation but nope. I would just miss the spell completely.  Basically what I'm saying is the combat is NOT VERY SMOOTH. 

7. Translation - What can I say... anything in the english language that has ""ag"" is censored.  You can say the most vulgar things, but you cannot say words like ""again"", ""bag"", ""lag"".  You cannot even type Neowiz out because it is censored.  Some of the spell translations are off too, so sometimes you just have to guess at what you are doing.

8. Not so rewarding grinding - Anything that isn't combat related is boring as HELLLL!!!

It is also engaging and doesn't revolve around spamming hotkeys in a certain rotation like other MMORPGs. I don't have the best PC (5+ years old) but with a few tweaks I managed to get the game running very smoothly in most areas in game so the FPS issues people are complaining about can be solved and I am sure eventually will be addressed by the developers thanks to the feedback.

This game doesn't deserve the hate and bad reviews from people not competent enough to actually give them. I think that a lot of people hating are simply afraid of all the players their current games are losing to Bless. Considering the sheer number of reviews in such a short time and the strain the servers have been under only shows just how many people are interested and playing. All I can say is don't let other people think for you and try it for yourselves.

I really wish I didn't have to choose whether I recommend or don't recommend this game, because it's based on what you, as a consumer can bare with. 

The game is definitely not perfect in any sense, As a newcomer to all of the hype surrounding Bless coming to NA, I didn't know what was promised and what wasn't. I didn't have any expectations coming into this game.

Here are the positives, The map is gorgeous, the aesthetic is absolutely lovely. It reminds me of the old MMORPGs that I used to play, with all the concepts being fairly similar. I like that It's not pay to win (at the time that I'm writing this). Honestly, I'm enjoying the game, but there are problems.

TRANSLATIONS: Many people complain about the translations. It says 2Level instead of Level 2 (Just saying, in your inventory, when you are looking at equip requirements for items, yes it says Level 11 or whatever). One of the bigger problems is that the developers didn't proofread the translations for the quests. The story scripts and dialogue seem to be fine (4 hours in game) but some of the quests (I've seen two so far) are hard to interpret. The first one many people complain about is ""Combat Poison"" when it should be ""Combat Stance or Combat Poise"". I got through that one without any trouble because I already looked through my skills menu, and i knew what Title Skill the quest was referring to.

PERFORMANCE: This one is really convoluted. Personally, I run the game just fine (I share the recommended settings for this game (i7-core GTX-1070, 16GB RAM) at 60fps+ in Fullscreen 1920x1080. At some points, however, I did have to lower the settings to improve performance in some areas. It didn't really affect the experience too much, just that while walking through a popular city, my framerate may have been choppy and below 60 frames. 

SUMMARY: If you don't think you can run the game, don't buy it, unless you are actually satisfied with a slideshow. It's going to be really hard for the devs to optimize performance, as they already released the full game and the storage space is masssive!!!. If you haven't talked to Non-English Immigrants before, and you don't like trying to interpret/decipher what they are talking about, don't play this game.

Honestly, I think people overreact sometimes, but hey, maybe the hype really skewed people's expectations for this version of Blessed. I really enjoy the gameplay and how the game looks (besides the fact that I can't move the camera upwards and I'm looking at the ground all the time). I see the potential, and I encourage people to stay optimistic. Who knows? Maybe we do see some improvements in the future.",True,1527701876,1527702264,True,1,0,0.000000,True

The game worth it but if you are just impatient and expecting perfections from the immediate start, wait few weeks because Early Access is intended for fixing issues and bugs while reworking the game and improving it.

Já joguei vários jogos em EA e já vi muitos bem piores que igual está sendo o do bless.
Jogo não está 100% claro que não o jogo não teve sequer um beta para testa ou faz o stress test.
O jogo está com um fps bem baixo Para UE3 e até quem tem PC's extremamente potentes estão percebendo isso, ele está muito mal otimizado com a renderização bugada entre outros bugs. (Além da filas de 1 a 4 horas de espera).

Sie(Neo) haben das Spiel teilweise aus Japanischer Sicht verändert, größtenteils sind diese Änderungen verständlich oder positiv zu sehen. 

Der Start von Bless hatte ein paar Probleme, allerdings fand ich den Start für ein riesiges AAA-MMORPG sehr gut und habe bei Releases von AION, WOW, ESO, Archeage und anderen MMORPGs schon schlimmeres erlebt. Dafür das, Bless noch (erst eine Woche) im Early Access ist, habe ich keine Disconnects, kaum Bugs oder andere Anfangsprobleme. Jede Quest, Dungeon bisher funktioniert und hing ich fest oder fiel ich durch die Map.

 Das beim Release eines AAA-MMORPG die Server nicht reichen, überfüllt sind und sich Warteschlangen bilden, ist normal (war bei jedem Spiel so). Außerdem hoffe ich dass Neo nicht den Schreienden nachgibt und zu viele Server öffnet, die in 2 Monaten verwaist sind (aufgrund der Unfähigkeit der Spieler).

Wirklich viele Leute beschwerten sich über Performence oder grafische Probleme. Dies kann ich für mich nicht bestätigen. Auf meinen Desktop(14+) läuft Bless stabil auf hoher Grafik (4 von 5) auf 50-60 FPS. Grafisch kommt es zwar nicht an zB. ESO Erweiterungen ran, aber sieht ziemlich gut aus. Auf meinem schlechten Laptop(600€, 3 Jahre alt) kann ich Bless auf Grafikstufe 2 immerhin mit ca 25 FPS spielen.

Schade finde ich dass Sie die zweite Steuerungmethode rausgenommen haben, Deutsch noch nicht integriert ist(aber das soll ja noch im EA kommen) und kein Megaserversystem (wie in ESO) eingeführt wurde.

Performance:
Ich habe eine GTX 1060 und spiele auf den höchsten Grafikeinstellungen Ingame und bei mir Lagt nichts, ruckelt nichts, keine FPS drops und ich bin bis jetzt nur einmal vom Server geflogen, weil Server Wartung war und ich es wegen Zocken nicht mitbekommen/gelesen hab xD

Erklärung Ingame:
Das sich hier viele aufregen, dass Sie ja einfach so ins Game geworfen wurden und außer der Steuerung WASD nichts wirklich erklärt wurde.... im gleichen Satz aber sagen, dass Sie schon 10 oder 15 Jahre MMOs zocken <.<
Dann muss man doch einfach schon ein wenig Ahnung und Erfahrung darin haben.
Ich hab mich zimlich schnell in Bless zurecht gefunden und finde alles sehr übersichtlich.
Nur eine erklärung wo man die Founder Packs abholen/aktivieren kann, hätte ich persönlich gut gefunden. Weil ich da tatsächlich im Ingame Chat nachfragen musste.

Maintenance:
""Immer nur Wartungsarbeiten und Server weg und mimimi...""
Seit froh das sie was tun!! Ich selbst hab schon so viele MMOs gezockt, bei den die Wartungsarbeiten 5-6 Std wegen des behebens eines Bugs gedauert haben. Und danach war der Bug immer noch da und ca 4873 neue Fehler.
Bless steht hier noch ganz am Anfang bei uns. Was erwarten manche? Als wäre jedes andere Game der Welt Fehlerfrei released worden. Lasst den Leuten von Bless doch einfach mal etwas Zeit!


Ich seh in Bless sehr viel potenzial ganz groß zu werden.
Auch wenn Bless schon ein paar Jahre auf dem Buckel hat und Grafisch vielleicht nicht mehr so beeindruckend ist wie manch andere...
Es macht, zumindest in meinen Augen, vieles wesentlich besser als andere MMOs.

Oh where to start... I guess we’ll take it from the login screen:

-Game freezes on “BLESS” screen and won’t let you in (you play the RNG game before you even get inside the game lol)
-After the initial cluster f**k, they opened new servers to manage the numbers, but these are all founders edition ppl, that already used up the founder items which were CHARACTER BOUND!!! (another mistake by these idiots, had it been account bound, ppl would’ve managed the servers better). So essentially if they wanted to use those items they were locked into that server and no choice but to wait and keep login back
-Union faction was almost instantly full, forcing you to pick the other
-Translation of the skills, some of the items and even UI were garbage
-FPS in this is probably the worst that I have ever seen... optimization is nonexistent!! 
-1 Healing class in the game, with atrocious tool kit for healing... so bad that even they have realized it and said will “Balance”... god knows when 
-Dupe bug in auction house

0,7,1,4661,4661,76561198199387595,0,german,False,42387741,"Hi everyone,

I have read so many negative reviews and heard so much hate about the game on youtube. 
I feel people are overreacting by quite a large margin. 
I never was a fanboy of the game, but I was really looking towards trying it out a bit and see what it's all about.
So far I really like the game. But still, Neowiz should continue to take the community feedback seriously, as there are a few avoidable issues that need to be addressed. I think the biggest issue the game has is really terribad marketing and community management. I have never seen something as clumsy as that. They really invite haters, and the MMO-community consists of mostly those. 

I would not make a review at this point normally, because I would prefer to know more about the game yet, but as people with 1,6h of playtime started bashing the game just because of performance issues and a questionable translation, I thought with 10h I should voice my first impressions with you to level the playing field a bit.

My pro/con list:

Pro:
- I personally love the graphics. The cities are beautiful, as are the character details and the landscape. There are some washed out textures that need replacing in the future, but that is no issue whatsoever. 
- I love the combat. I come from Aion that comes with quite a complex tab-target combat which I also appreciated. However, I like it that quite a bit of the combat happens in the preparation phase of it by curating your skills and stances. That also makes it easier to grasp the combat quickly, as you don't have to bind like 40 skills to your keyboard, but still having (if I calculated correctly) about 19 skills on only 7 buttons. The combat needs a bit of polishing still, but the basis is quite fun! I however like tab-target combat and prefer it over action combat which I consider less strategic. I was playing mage, but berserker seems to have some action combat elements, too. Don't count on a pure action combat however. 
- I love the option to tame and that taming really gives you recognizable benefits.
- I have not yet experienced much of the dungeon/PVP endgame yet, but the mid-range dungeons are a bit easy but fun and relaxing. The PVP is superb however so far (I haven't had much chance to test that though, so...). 
-  Character progression: I love it to level up not only your character, but also choose passive skills, upgrade your active skills in different ways, gaining whole new stances with lots of new skills, leveling up your mounts, minions and companions as well. Very rewarding, diverse and, well, fun!

Neutral:
- Believe it or not, but as for me I had no performance issues whatsoever even in extremely crowded situations. I haven't measured my FPS, but I have not witnessed any (!) stuttering; everthing was really smooth and crisp for me. I have a strong machine however: i7 8700K, GTX1080, 16GB-3166MHz, EVO860-SSD. I recognize however that there are still some issues to be addressed here.
- The story is not great, but better than most mmos I know. 
- The voice acting is not great either, but not terrible at all.
- I was afraid my ultrawide wouldn't work, but it does! With a small ini-fix the camera works well, too.

Con: 
- The english translation of the story is good, but the translation of the skills and quests is horrible. If you gave me a day and a korean dictionary I could do the translations better than that. Please, Neowiz, that is easy to fix!
- Everything seems a bit ""clean"" for my taste. The environment, character models (not however monsters) and environment might need a bit more life (like dirt, destroyed buildings, high bushes etc.). 
- The tutorial and introduction in the story aren't good. Please enhance that, that cannot be too difficult but it makes the start into the so much more enjoyable.

Temporary Cons:
- The servers are quite crowded and server management is not very good. How could they every think one server was enough? Bad planning that causes long queues. An additional issue is (interestingly) not lags but delays with certain activities in the game (like picking up things, changing armor sets...). 
- Log screen issue. Apparently fixed already however.

Overall however, I have been having a blast so far with the game, despite the problems I have encountered as well. 

Give the game a chance, I think you will not be sorry. However, you might wanna wait a few days, even weeks, so the launch problems are resolved.

The first day was quite rough but that's too be expected for a Early Access game (beta) IMO. I run a 1080ti and was getting very low fps on day one for the majority of the day, 5-15 fps in the city crowded with players all over.

I made it to level 20 here on day one.
Day two has been great so far I've got to level 40. I play a berserker and I enjoy the game, but I think they need to smooth out the Fps issues and other technical issues that people are having. But I would recommend this game to my friends but ensure they know it is In EAI and what that entails.

I decided to try the game out despite the known problems that the game was having in terms of lagg, fps and other issues.

The result of these problems was that I had to do some changing in INI files which took me some a few minutes. After this I logged on and was hit with another problem. I couldnt connect to the server and was stuck. I ended up having to reload the game about 15 times before getting in. This was a pain and I'm glad Neowiz is aware and are trying to fix this problem.

Despite the rough start, I went in with a good clean mentality. It's early access and they just launched. Fair enough they could've handled it better, but I will not let this cloud my judgement of the actual game.

I thought the game was very interesting and I felt invited to really try out this new experience. The combat was fun and felt new and the gameplay feels nice and balanced.

Overall I'm now 22 now and will defo keep enjoying my time.

Ofcourse, the game Isn't without faults. A few problems I have are ofcourse with some of the movement feeling a little wonky. I also dislike some keybind choices and the fact that I can't bind my mouse keys to any buttons. 

I thank the Bless Online Developers for all the hard work they're putting into the game and I  hope that people will come to realise that its just Early access and despite the problems they'll rethink their review.

Acqua sotto i ponti ne è passata davvero troppa e se state leggendo penserete: è valsa la pena aspettare tutto questo tempo?...
Ni... partiamo dal lancio... fatto male, anzi malissimo. Dall'annuncio dei founder's pack che sono quasi inutili e costosissimi alla penuria di video in-game e così via.
Ma.... davvero il gioco è stato ripensato e ripulito? allora prima com'era??? I requisiti hardware sono alti, altissimi e per cosa? Dov'è tutta questa grafica e velocità che possa giustificare un simile esborso hardware? Non ci siamo... devono ottimizzare il tutto ed alla svelta davvero. Per non parlare dei bug di questi due giorni di early access.... ma dico... lo hanno provato??? Non si poteva neppure loggare... imbarazzante, solo ora dovrebbero aver sistemato il problema... Va bhè dai il gioco non è bruttissimo, ma è davvero vecchia scuola e secondo me nel cercare di prendere il meglio dagli altri titoli riesce invece a prendere il peggio o quesi.
Ma nel 2018 perchè devo scegliere una fazione ad inizio gioco e poi non poter usere le razze dell'altra fazione???? Che senso ha fare come Aion??? Ma li le razze erano due; qui se ne ostentano 7 ma tre non le puoi toccare... almeno non liberamente.
La storia finora è passabile, ma nulla di nuovo davvero. La grafica è ben animata con PG che si impiantano in cancelletti, paletti e ... vabbhè bug vari, ma.... davvero serve ancora un combat system con la tabulazione? Cioè l'aggancio dei bersagli?? Ma non si sono vantati per due, dico due anni!!!! di aver sistemato la questione per il mercato occidentale.
Va bene non mi dilungo troppo perchè i tempi non sono maturi, ma allo stadio attuale...

grafica ed animazioni gradevoli... e basta.
varietà di razze... 
combat system divertente, ma...

vecchio stile che farà storcere il naso
musiche ripetitive e sottotono
ma... perchè non posso scegliere liberamente le razze???

I find the pieces that make it fun outweigh those that drag it down. If you're looking for an incredibly well polished UI/experience with perfect translations, this is NOT the game for you. 

Here are pros, cons, recommendations for the developers, and a discussion.

Pros:
- Fun combat, the combo system feels nice imo.
- Very fun PvP. A guild mate and I accidentally started a faction war in an open area last night and spent two hours laughing while we and the Union zergs kept going at it.
- Taming system is really fun. Nothing like riding a giant caterpillar into battle.
- Large world.
- Dungeons are fun.
- Mix between PvE and PvP is well done.
- Not P2W.
- Crafting and Gathering is a rather smooth experience.
- Regardless of what everyone else is saying, the devs are trying. They just issued a public apology for the rough start and have been very on top of fixing issues. That alone is a pro that most people don't give credit for. Yes, it's their job, but so many other Early Access games almost never make it to a full release and leave their product dead and unfixed. So props there.

Cons:
- Poor optimization (This can be EASILY fixed by editing an .ini file (the fixes are all over Reddit, it's not hard to find)
- Very poor translations. 
- Servers are somewhat unstable (supposed to be fixed during this maintenance).
- Market board is buggy. I would be more forgiving on this point if there were trading or another way to trade/sent items to friends and guild mates, but currently it involves:
   > one person posting an item on the market board for the minimum value allowed
   > a few minutes of waiting, 
   > the ""receiver"" trying to grab the item before someone else does (but the search doesn't always work, so it's means spamming to try and get the item to show up to even figure out if it's posted).
- Some parts of the game haven't been implemented yet (see Recommendations and Discussion).

Recommendations:
- Build on the guild experience. Add a guild chest, guild house, etc., more content for us to do as a group 
- Add way for us to help out other guild members with gear instead of trying to go to the market place at the same time and one of us trying to scoop up whatever the other just posted for as cheap as they can post it.
- Accelerate the addition of existing content. We have gear dropping for assassin/mystic, but don't have the classes. Also, we have dungeons for the current level cap that don't drop loot. Because of this, there's no incentive to do those dungeons. We also have slevel (for unlocking the last 2 skills/traits), content beyond level 45, and other pieces of the game that I would love to experience, but they are still unavailable.

Discussion:
As mentioned in the pros, the PvPvE balance is done well. It will only get better as content is added.
I am shocked that so much of the community dove into a game that is labelled as early access, bought a Founder's Pack to get a HEAD START in EARLY ACCESS (Early early access??) and are raging about the imperfections. Yes, the game has been released in 3 other regions, it should be at least more well optimized. But that also means we knew what bugs to expect. If they aren't fixed on the other regions, why would they bring us the game all polished and not bring it to the other regions first (where these players have been waiting)? 
Also, regarding the server issues, I personally feel as though they didn't expect some of the larger streamers to bring attention (and more people) to this game, causing queue times and full servers.
They are even being very lenient on refunds for people who are absolutely unsatisfiable. That's a great move by them honestly.

I have only had to sit in a queue once and it was only about 5 minutes or so. Optimization is the next priority-which is pretty fantastic.

1. Das Game is neu von einem noch sehr unbekannten entwicker die vielecht den ansturm auf das game unterschätz

2. Leute  fast euch doch mal selber am kopf und fragt euch..... gab es jemals ein game was von anfang an reibungslos
und ohne neustarts und server upgrades bzw patsches von statten gegangen ist? also das habe ich in meinen 20 jahren wo ich MMORPGs spiele noch nie...nie, nie, nieee  mals gesehen und ich habe schon viele games miterlebt. habe sogar schon schlimmeres erlebt.

3.Die was jetzt einfach los flamen und das game schlecht machen wollen haben keine ahnung! geht lieber raus spielen
und verkauft euren PC.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So jetzt zum Review

Im ganzen und großen ist es ein super game.Daumen Hoch
Wie jedes neues game hat auch dieses seine schwierigkeiten die massen unter die haube zu bringen . 
Aber welches game kann das schon von sich behaupten, bei start super zu laufen KEINER.
Die grafik is nicht die neuste, aber trozdem sehr schön anzusehen das währe für mich kein minuspunkt
die skills und ausführungen sind ebenfalls sehr schön . ein bisschen gewöhnungs bedürftig aber cool  is mal was anderes.
Und ja diese game würde ich mir wieder kaufen !!!!

Also liebe leute nicht so kritisch sein ,stellt euch vor ihr würdet ein game rausbringen was eigendlich ein super game ist.
Und dann nur weil ihr die massen unterschätzt die euer game spielen wollen und dann alles zusammen bricht.
seits doch froh das neue games kommen !

weil stellt euch mal  vor es würden keine neuen games mehr gemacht und rauskommen  was würdet ihr tuen ???
das kann ich euch sagen!!
nämlich raus gehen und leute treffen die euch anschauen und vl auch mal wohin einladen zum trinken gehen
oder sogar mit zu dir nach hause wollen!???  ba  voll doof oder.. is ja wie damal wo wir noch briefe mit
kugelschreiber (was auch immer das sein mag) geschrieben wurden und dann zufuß zu sonem gelben kasten geracht..
tz   kaum vorstellbar oder .....  lach


ich werde es weiter empfehlen !
ich werde es weiterhinn Zocken ,weil ich finde das es ein großartiges game ist.
ich geh jetzt wieder zocken vl  sehr ir mich ja mal ingame  :)

Mucha gente está puntuando negativamente este juego porque no han satisfecho sus ganas de jugar gratis o no han tenido la suficiente paciencia de dejarle al juego uno o dos meses de margen para que vaya estableciéndose y creando muy buenos resultados (que seguro llegarán).

I just want to say despite all the hate going on, I still love the game. I'm happy to see that they are atleast trying to fix all the bugs and disconnecting problems.  

     TIPS: Do not open the game from the desktop or the steam folder, open only from the steam app because the game 
     will keep disconnecting no matter what. Also, If you are experiencing the splash loading bug and get stuck there, If the 
     game dosnt launch within 5 seconds of seeing this splash, close the game rinse and repeat until you enter the 
     server/character creation then you should be good to play. For the FPS issue, I found this on reddit and I think it might 
     help people to gain a boost in FPS 
     https://www.reddit.com/r/Bless/comments/8mumqg/ultimate_list_of_config_ini_settings/

My biggest issue with the game is maybe the late game contains but I am very far of that point since I hate rushing video games. I take the time to read everything. However, I am confident that BLESS team will release more stuff a few weeks after the real launch such as pvp late game contain, daily special mission etc. I am a very patient person so that's why I dont mind the wait. Another issue that many people are mad at ( and they are totally right to be ) Is the fact that you might be lock from joining your friend on a specific server because its too full. 

In the end I would recommand this game for Non-Elitist gamers, those who just want to chill and not rush the game in 2 days, and for the people who can wait for the BlESS team to fix most bugs and optimisation issues.",True,1527699243,1527699243,True,0,1,0.502229,True

- No endgame content as of now, they cut content out of the original game for no apparent reason, even tho Assassin/Mystic were not released at launch, it could have been cool having them from day one.
- The english translation is bad and even the tutorial is affected.
- The ""west optimization"" that was promised is not here, this game is running on a DX9 Unreal 3 engine, which is super bad optimized and performs poor even on really good computers, not to mention that fact the game isn't even that impressive visual wise.

The Translation has some issues with ""You reached 2Level"" (is now fixed) but I'm sure they'll work on this since they still have 1 year for the rest to be done. 


Overall I can really say: I don't understand all the Negative Reviews out of frustration due to big playeramounts trying the game in it's current state. It's really not objective at all. If you're looking for a MMORPG with absolute outstanding Armor design, VERY FAIR INGAME SHOP (nowhere near p2w) and beautiful Dungeons/Ingame Design/Character Design-Creator/Story, bless is for you.

Tout d'abord j'ai appris la sortie du jeu il y a un mois à peine (gg la com), j'étais très hypé par la sortie d'un ""nouveau"" MMO jusqu'à ce que je me renseigne plus en profondeur, au début très jouasse (fan de cosmetic j'étais limite prêt à dépenser 150€) mais après m'être renseigné je suis resté sur la réserve. J'étais donc sur le point de d'acheter le jeu quand je l'ai obtenu miraculeusement dans un giveaway de dernière minute, et mon dieu que je suis pas déçu de pas l'avoir acheté (même si j'aurais refund). Et oui j'ai joué 2 heures mais ça m'a suffit largement pour m'avancer sur les points suivants.

Pourquoi?
_Le premier truc c'est la customisation des personnage, fournie mais loin d'être à la hauteur de ce qu'il se fait maintenant.
_Ensuite nom de dieu la traduction.. Des erreurs partout, les noms de sorts dans les quêtes qui sont pas les mêmes que le personnage etc.. passé 20 minutes à comprendre ce que la PREMIERE quête me demandait de faire, à savoir bidouiller je ne sais qu'elle sort qui en faite n'avait pas du tout le même nom, brefons.
_La Maniabilité me donne envie de me coller des giffles.
_Le système de combat pas du tout dynamique.
_L'OPTIMISATION.
_Les restrictions de créations de personnages et de choix de faction, compréhensible mais chiant, quand on sait que l'équilibrage n'est sans doute déjà plus le même avec les arrêts et refund.
_Le Cash shop ideux.
_Les exploit bug comme la duplication d'objets (mais je m'avance pas trop dessus j'y ai pas assité).

J'ai que ça en tête dans l'immédiat, mais je dois sûrement oublier une ou deux choses.
Pour résumer c'est un MMO tout ce qu'il y a de plus à la ramasse, rien d'innovant, j'ai l'impression qu'ils ont pris des petits trucs qui marchait sur un peu tout les MMO mais qu'ils les ont mal implantés.

Et qu'on ne me parle pas d'early acces, en sachant que le jeu est jouable depuis fin 2016 dans d'autres régions.

Positiv:

- Bless Online macht mir extrem viel spaß und darum sollte es doch bei einem Spiel gehen
- Es gibt viele möglichkeiten (crafting/taiming)
- Char erstellung ist sehr umfangreich und kein 0815 Müll
- Community auf meinem Server ist sehr hilfsbereit (ausgenommen sind natürlich die üblichen ""BDO ist besser"" und ""Just got my refund"" Spieler

Negativ:

- Loadscreen Bug (es dauert ewig bis du überhaupt ins Spiel kommst)
- FPS/Performance Probleme
- Keine Deutsche Übersetzung wie Angekündigt (das häkchen wurde nun auch bei ""Deutsch"" einfach entfernt)
- Content der Angekündigt wurde fehlt

Fazit:

Trotzdem gebe ich Bless Online eine chance , das Thema Loadscreen Bug kann mit einem Tool behoben werden - Gleiches gillt für FPS Probleme die mit ein paar änderungen in der .ini auch schnell erledigt sind.

Klar wurde das Spiel bereits released, wissen wir doch alle! Allerdings sollte man den Entwicklern trotzdem etwas Zeit geben die aktuellen Probleme zu beheben und nicht direkt Negativ geben :)

In a nutshell, I cannot in good conscious recommend that anyone pay money for this game in it's current state.   

HOWEVER, if you're the type of gamer who doesn't mind rolling the dice on a product in Early Access that may or may not reach its potential in the future, I do recommend giving it a chance simply based on the fact that I'm enjoying it so far and am able to look past its many flaws right now.

While the framerates have been FAR from unplayable for me, unlike most people claim them to be, they are pretty bad at times.  

The English translations are poorly done and need tons of cleanup.  

The voice acting is subpar and often feels out of place, at least it's there though. 
Bad or not though, there is a ton of it which is nice and still better than none at all.

The story so far is decent at least somewhat enjoyable.

The combat is extremely fun to me.  Many dont like it, but its unique enough to feel fresh in my opinion. 

The world looks great, character animations and skills are solid and character creation is amazing.

I am going to make this a positive review for the moment since I am enjoying myself and feel like my money hasn't been completely wasted YET.  This is subject to change though depending on what Neowiz does to improve things going forward.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME yet if you are not okay with bad performance, translations, bugs, log in issues and think you'll get frustrated waiting on fixes to roll in (if they ever do).

Give it a shot though if you dont mind major growing pains.

A lot of people are coming into the game with preconceived opinions that have been spread by people who have been criticising the game on social media platforms- mainly youtube. This is mainly due to the chain of failed launches in different regions. Consequently, this game has been the subject of controversy with people claiming that it's a cash-grab, that its optimisation is horrible, it's pay-to-win, etc. even before it has begun, and I feel like this has carried over into their reviews, as their opinions were already shaped before the game had even launched.

 Having played the game for a bit now, I feel like the amount of criticism it is receiving is unfair. It is by no means a perfect game, and it is not expected to be on launch. The change in their management for the Western release doesn't help at all in this regard, and the expectation for them to have overhauled everything in their game is not only unrealistic, but unfair. The game is a work in progress, regardless of the fact that it has been released beforehand. As we have no idea what's going on behind the scenes of the company, I feel that it is unfair to be comparing the game to its predecessors, claiming that ""oh, it hasn't changed at all!""- there is more that goes into making a game than simply coding it. Instead, we should base their merit on what is achieved following their release, whether they make significant, impactful progress, and if they take community suggestions into consideration. That being said, I'll go into what I believe is good and bad about the game, to help provide a more, relatively neutral perspective.

Before that, though, here are my specs: 
OS: Windows 10, 64-Bit
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690K CPU @ 3.50GHz (4 CPUs), ~3.5GHz
Memory: 16384MB RAM
Card name: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970


Let me preface this by saying I have personally had minimal optimisation issues. I launched past the title screen without issue, and the game is relatively FPS lag-free after it loads for the first time. In cities, where there are lots of people, it can get a bit hectic, but this was fixed on my end by reducing my graphics settings a bit. Later, I found the reddit .ini tweaks that allowed the game to utilise my computer's systems properly, and this allowed me to increase my graphics settings to maximum without any FPS drops outside of cities, and minor, barely noticeable FPS drops inside of cities that last for maximum ~3 seconds whilst textures load in. 

[b][u]Combat Pros [/u][/b]

-Solid combat system; feels enjoyable. As a fan of action RPGs, this combat system was pretty appealing to me. It flows relatively* decently and isn't boring at all. It's refreshing compared to the other MMOs that kinda just have you clicking or standing there pressing the same buttons for one skill. The combos allow for a lot of variety in how you play, and you can apply lots of different effects to enemies.

-Beginnings of action combat are in place. Only implemented in berserker for now, though. Basically lets you control your camera with mouse movements only, none of that right click + hold stuff. 

[b][u]Combat cons [/u][/b]

-*Combat system has some timing issues- you need to press a button to start a chain, then a different button to chain in other abilities. For example, a ranger presses 1>Y>Y to get a rapid fire combo going. 1 shoots the first shot, Y shoots a different ability, the second Y starts the flurry of arrows. The keys seem to not register for the first ~half a second after your previous command, so if you press 1, there is no issue, but if you press Y too quickly, it won't shoot. Same for the second Y press. This isn't an issue for most combos, because it's easily solved by button mashing, BUT if your ability is a hold ability, eg for archers, 1>R>R(Hold) to charge an arrow, it can be problematic because if you start holding too early, you stand there looking like a tool and you fail your combo. If the devs can fix this, the combat will 100% be amongst the most engaging of the MMO genre from my perspective. Keep in mind, I am an action RPG fan. 

-Action combat still in process of implementation for other classes, but it's coming soon ! 

-Optimising your skill trees as of now (you can upgrade each ability into one of two trees) is pretty risky, because the translations are not fully completed. In most cases, they're understandable, but sometimes you have no idea what is being changed about the ability. Personally, I just didn't upgrade anything besides my character stats and I've made it through the game fine. 

[b][u]General Gameplay Pros[/u][/b]

-Solid main storyline, nicely animated; I feel like this MMO is trying to world build quite a bit. Their story is not excellent, but it's not unengaging either. It's above adequate for an MMO.

-Open World PvP is pretty damn good; it's not always there, but every now and again you see a red name appear in a contested zone and if they don't notice you, it's just fun to hammer them in

-Most of the main storyline is protected, so a lot less PvP when levelling

-Some PvP areas are guarded by OP NPCs who will spank whoever hits you, so it's great to see it happen to someone

-Active world, there's quite a few players, significant amount of NPCs

-Pokemon is fun as hell, and it's rather addicting to catch every monster. Just satisfying.

-Aesthetic asf character design despite relatively dated engine. Anyone who says this game looks bad is exaggerating; it looks pretty damn good, especially when you consider that you can have a hundred players on the screen at once.

[b][u]General Gameplay Cons[/u][/b] 

-Really lacking explanations, you'll need to stick with the game for a bit to understand everything, or just ask people in the game. The wiki might as well be non-existent right now. Thankfully there's a help tab where you can ask other players for help. 

-Very strange censorship practices that should be fixed. There's some kind of spaghetti code going on with the system they're using to censor chat; as of now, words containing ""ag"" are infamously censored. Meaning you can't even say ""Mage"". Also can't say ""horse"" sometimes. Or anything with ""heck"" in it- so no ""check"". 

-No autoloot, rip my ""F"" key

-No p2p trading YET; the function is there but it's glitched. There is still the auction house, which is buggy at times- but this is solved by just reopening it.

[b][u]Shop/Membership Pros[/u][/b]

-Not P2W, no matter how you look at it; everything is convenience / cosmetic only. Getting membership for extra XP saves you a few hours from levelling to max- also gold is slow to earn even with membership, I feel the main way of getting big bucks in the game will be through auction housing, which isn't really affected too much by the membership/ This was a huge concern for many people, so it's good that the shop isn't causing any issues.

-Can earn lumena in game

-Can convert in-game tokens to lumena through an exchange system

Overall the game is really enjoyable in its current state. My biggest issues with it personally are the slightly delayed combat (which is actually a huge annoyance for me, since I want to use my damn charged skills), the weird translations, and the lack of detailed explanation. 

I can see all of these issues being fixed in the near future, and if NeoWiz really does manage to solve these problems, I can imagine the game as being a solid contendor in the MMO market in the future. Gameplay is fun and engaging for now despite these issues, so ultimately, the long term success of the game hinges on the company being proactive in improving the product they have. If they manage their resources well, Bless will definitely be a successful game.",True,1527698270,1527698498,True,7,50,0.576668,True

It's not earth shattering as far as mechanics go but the combat is fun, the character models are lovely, and levelling as been fairly smooth.  Also has a 'witcher' feel to the world which is fun.

The launch was a bit of a slog, but settled down quickly as they added more servers (which honestly I prefered instead of launching with hundreds all of which end up empty).

On a downside there's a slightly old fashioned feel to some of the mechanics.  Things like mob tagging, looting one thing at a time etc - all here. It's also not brilliantly optimised. Not to the level some people are complaining about but it's definitely a bit laggy when swapping channels or arriving in a new location.  Expect a few moments as the models and textures catch up.

0,210,1,303,303,76561197970723488,0,english,False,42386989,"Let's get the fact checking out of the way. Bless saw a original release in Korea back in 2011. We don't know how long it was in development but the average development cycle for games is 3-5 years.  It can be argued that Bless is a ten year old game, It runs on DirectX 9 so that alone tells you it's age. It failed in the Korean market, it failed in the Russian market and it failed in Japan.

Here we are with the North American release and the game is blowing up! It seems to be a very successful release right now. I cannot comprehend it. Are we so thirsty for a new MMO that we rush to anything that's called ""new"" like its a new flavor of ice-cream? Because this isn't at all new but it's being marketed as new...they want you to think it's a early access game. It's not!

Neowiz is lying to you. They lied about the NA veing a ""reborn"" version of Bless. We were told that Bless combat would be more action orientated like Black Deset Online. WHAT? Who thinks Bless combat is like BDO? Absolutely no one.

I won't get into the whole idea that we American's have a severe whale mentality when it comes to games. How we throw money at studios and developers left and right in the hope of satisfying some insatiable need for entertainment. Instead I will focus on the facts...and the fact is this game, Bless Online, does NOTHING NEW.

Seriously, there is nothing innovative or new in this game. If you were lucky enough to watch the various ""Emissaries"" play Bless on the Japanese Client/Servers...you would have seen a game very similar in playstyle to Everquest.You would have seen a very basic, bare bones hot-button smashing theme-park orientated MMO with zero style or flourish. Absolutely nothing sets this game apart from games from the 90s like Everquest or DAOC. In fact, speaking of these older games, they were done better. That's saying something!

Please stop throwing money at this project (I can't call it a game because it's more of a business excersize at this point as they keep rereleasing it trying to make money). We have to stop letting publishers and development teams treat us like idiots. The NA market wants a new MMO but Neowiz isn't providing us a new MMO, they're providing us with their 4th time recycled trash. Again, the NA market is full of people wanting a new MMO...but this isn't it. Look somewhere else.

The combat in Bless is garbage for lack of a better term. It was clearly created by people who do not understand what fun combat is. There are telegraphed mechanics in dungeons that require you to move out of the way in some fun mobile fashion...yet there is no such fun mobile movement in Bless. There's no dodge, there's no blocking, no teleporting, nothing, you just walk your slow character out of the red stuff in an incredibly boring fashion. (the ranger class can dodge, with a cool down of 35 seconds!)  

Beyond the combat: Bless online offers nothing entertaining as far as questing goes. You mosey from area to area and kills hordes of the same mobs with the same linear boring combos for hours. You kill things, you collect things, then you auto walk them back to turn them in, rinse and repeat a thousand times until your next boring lingear dungeon. Also, all the story quests are instanced and there's no way to do them with friends. Similarly, the first two dungeons are soloable. So, Bless does a terrible job of enticing you with fun content later by giving you a taste of what is to come early in the game. 

Also, as I'm sure you've heard, the translations are quite confusing on the skill tooltips for. This creates a feeling of just button smashing at first because you're not really sure what the debuffs are or even what your skills are doing. eventually you figure them out by trial and error. People in the game are saying that's part of what makes a game fun is figuring out what works, but that's not what is happening here. This challenge is based on a failure to translate the game into understandable english...if this is your type of challenge, play a different MMO in a language you don't understand.  

Gear:  Initially (for the first 30 levels, as far as I was willing to play) you do not find armor save for in dungeons, and even then, you rarely get drops that are for your class. Basically you get new gear by just buying it from each new dungeon merchant. Which takes the fun out of exploring and defeating mobs for a chance of better stuff. Normal mobs have a chance to drop a weapon that is class specific and you will find yourself getting a lot of weapons that aren't for you. And if you happen to be questing with your friends and they aren't close enough to bid on the item, there is no way to give it to them because there is no trading. (maybe they will add trading later, but this is just a minor annoyance anyway) 


Easily the worst MMO I've ever played. 
Most people are refunding or quitting because of the technical issues, but there are core game mechanics that are just unfixable without a complete redesign, these (listed above) suck the fun out of the game and create an experience that can be found, without having to spend 40 dollars, by rubbing fine grit sand paper all over your body until you have no skin left.

Personally kinda wish they made the game into 1 Mega Server. with 50 Channels.  = it be more fun that way.  Instead of opening new server. (just worried about future and health of servers on population both sides)

Been having blast so far level 33 Paladin.  Cant wait to see Action Combat how it play out.  Also looking forward to future classes, as well end game.  

The tame system is pretty awesome, being able to grab cool mobs like scorpions/lions/hyenas/demons/dragon to ride on, which have ability to get random skill.  Also get ""Pets"" which follow you around and give you abilities as well but dont fight for you, but its really cool to find a RARE pet... and have them follow you around and people want to know were you got it from.

Cash Shop seems little bit on expansive i think if they drop the price by 30% it should be just right. 

PvP is alot of fun,  but open world can get little bit zergy... but its alot of fun to fight other people in open world 1 on 1. or 2vs2.  Looking forward to try out the PVP Arenas/Raid PVPs.

Honestly once the game stabilizes i think this is a good game to pass time, till something better comes around.  The game is alot of fun, and interesting things to do.  

Also Lore/Story if you take your time to read/cut scenes you meet some interesting written characters, hopefully they fix their translations little bit.  But i love all main quests are fully voiced.

I would give this game is 8/10 and it has alot of potential to grow.

Hallo Steam-Community! Die schlechten Rezensionen bringen mich dazu meinen ersten Review zu schreiben.
Heutzutage verlassen sich viele Menschen auf die Rezensionen anderer Mitmenschen und lassen sich evtl. komplett in die Irre leiten.

Vorab eine kleine Auflistung von Fakten die unantastbar sind:
[list]
    [*]Dieses Spiel befindet sich im Early-Access und somit [b] MUSS JEDEM [/b]  bewusst sein, dass dieses Spiel noch nicht fertig entwickelt wurde und evtl. anfallende Probleme den Spielgenuss verschlechtern.
    [*]Man unterstützt die Entwicklung, wenn man bereit ist Geld für den Early Access zu bezahlen.
    [*]Man kann statt einen riesigen Shitstorm zu verursachen (der im Übrigen seltenst angebracht ist), sich in Foren zusammensetzen und Vorschläge in der BLESS Online Community ausarbeiten und zusammentragen (aber dazu muss das einfache PLEBS wohl zusammenarbeiten -> heutzutage will ja jeder alles sofort und möglichst einfach haben #ihrwiedertmichan)
[/list]


Da im MMO Bereich ""Word of Warcraft"" mit Abstand das erfolgreichste Spiel ist, wird es wohl für diejenigen die sich in diesem Metier versuchen wollen, es schwer haben. Dennoch habe ich mich entschlossen, so objektiv wie möglich an BLESS heranzuwagen. Es hat mich gefesselt und dies nicht gerade wenig. Das Kampfsystem ist großartig und fulminant. Grafisch ist es großartig. Es weist ein komplexes System auf was ich noch nicht richtig verstanden habe -> sowas treibt meine Neugierde nur noch weiter an!

Viele Rezensenten versuchen das Ganze auch darüber abzuwälzen, dass das Spiel eig. gar nicht ""neu"" ist, was theorethisch stimmt, da das Spiel im asiatischen Raum schon im Jahre 2012 veröffentlicht wurde aber praktisch durch gravierende Änferungen des Spiels (bspw. das Kampfsystem) hinfällig ist.
Nicht ohne Grund gibt es unter den Programmierern den wohlbekannten Spruch ""Never touch a running system !"". Aber anscheinend sind viele negative Rezensenten gefühlt plötzlich zu Programmierern geworden und können durch etliche Erfahrung solche Sachen beurteilen. Ich glaube eher weniger. Im Detail weiß niemand richtig was diese Probleme verursacht. Man vermutet nur. 

Während des Headstarts gab es einige Probleme, die den Spielgenuss negativ beeinflusst haben - wer diese leugnet wär auch echt ein [b] NARR [/b]:

[list]
    [*]Splash Screen
    [*]Perfomance Probleme (die ich persönlich nur in Städten habe)
    [*]Überlastung der Server 
[/list]

Ist ja nicht so als würde sich niemand drum kümmern, siehe jetzt zwei Stunden Wartungsarbeiten.

Trotz all den Problemen, die das Spiel aktuell hat, fesselt es mich und würde es wieder kaufen.

0,147,3,4774,4774,76561198012907628,0,english,False,42386812,"So I just want to start this off with saying, dont pay attention to most of these negative reviews. They are all honestly just crybabys because the game did not work flawlessly on its early access release date. I have seen MMO's bomb much worse than this on the first day. Yeah the game has problems with it, hence the ""Early Access"" title. But if you are not childish enough to just cry about all this and actually try to play the game, then in my opinion it is pretty fun. 

I am going to review a few notes, some being my own and some being stuff I have noticed others complaining about and my take on them. As a preface, I come from 3 years of Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) and might make reference back to that in my review.

1. ""LAG."" 
Yeah. Just yeah. There is definately lag for this game when 10's of thousands of people log in at the same time and put a strain on the system, moreso if your on one of the large servers that always say full. (I only assume that number played based on the amount of reviews and the fact the packs made the top 3 sales of steam for the day.)---Frame lag is also a thing I experience. Albiet not as intensly bad as everyone else says it is. My frames maybe drop down to about 30 but usually stay at a healthy 50-59. I figure because the game has not entirely been properly optimized yet for Western systems. In this case I dont see it taking too long to fix as Neowiz has shown pretty good PR so far. (Just going to keep Lag in 1 posting instead of making 5 seperate points on it.)

2. ""Getting stuck on splash screen."" 
I will not deny this is a problem that a few people I talk to even encounter. I had it effect me once during my first time playing. I think I managed to find an easy fix to it, I just go to my games files and run the launcher as Administrator. Never had the issue again after that point. From my understanding Neowiz knows this is an issue and is currently working on fixing it so I wont cry over spilt milk here. 

3. ""The NEW Combat System."" 
This will be an interesting one. Since for me this is an entirely new combat system than what I am used to with ESO's point and click style fighting. Sure it seemed a bit cumbersome to have to click your target to attack them but I picked up on the tab-target system pretty quickly. I also find it somewhat fun to have to pick and choose which combos you use for certain situations. (Playing a lot on the mage). Though the downside for me is I wish they could be customized in some way. Such as choosing what your combo actually is, rather than relying on their pre-made stuff. I do hope they change it later on also in a way so I can add mouse bindings for skills or potions and such, even certain keyboard shortcuts.

4. ""PvP."" 
I cant really say anything here. Havent had an instance of PvP yet but when I do I will be sure to update this.

5. ""Optimization.""
So I know the game is having optimization issues right now. But anybody that was following Bless for even a little bit or reading the forums and other things would know why the optimization is how it is right now. The game doesnt look as pretty as it does or have a crazy amount of NPC's in it because they purposely, temporarily, got rid of it all to make the game more stable for launch day. The only thing worse would be if people couldnt even play at all. Though to be fair, a lot of people are saying that citys and towns feel dead. I dont fell that at all because every town I go to is bustling with players to make them feel alive. I personally feel a lot better seeing groups of players travelling together through a town than an NPC on a set loop/path. Though not to worry as I am sure this will all be fixed in due time. 

6. ""Translations.""
I have noticed only a small handful of instances where translations were not spot on. The major one being your level-up diologue. But aside from all that I would say this is far from gamebreaking. If the community would be sensible then all your need to do is report these instances to Neowiz and they will fix them. Mind you the ENTIRE MMO had to be revamped for a whole different language. Of course there would be a hiccup here or there. If people argue otherwise then I would love to see them redo a game with a different language. 

7. ""Broken Quests.""
A lot of people are saying they appear to be stuck on quests because they 'break'. I can say I have no clue what they are talking about. I have a level 20 mage in the union and have never had a quest break on me. I failed 1 once, but it gave me an option to restart at the beginning. So yeah. Other then that the most broken thing I could say is there appears an issue where certain voiced diologue is not there but that doesnt really bother me as I like to read along with it anyway.

8. ""Public Relations.""
This is where Neowiz really shines. Out of every game I play, MMO or otherwise. Neowiz has had by far the best PR I have ever seen. They respond quick to issues, actually listen to the community, and work in our best interests. Hell! They lowered the price of their pre-order package and even adjusted it based on the community's voice about it! I have literally never seen this before. In all complete honesty I feel most of those negative reviewers or people complaining about the game are just picking on Neowiz because they can.

9. ""Classes."" 
This is probably my one negative criticism on them. I personally do not like the idea that classes are race locked. I would love to play any class with any race but that might just be because I was spoiled by ESO in this regard. Also with the point of the 3 classes that appear to be locked on everyone. If they could at least say something, unless I overlooked it, on when or how this will be unlocked then I would have something to look forward to. 

10. ""Side Notes.""
As I stated previously I have a level 20 Mage as a member of the Union. I have been wholly enjoying my experience in the game so far. I admit it was a rocky start because you have to get used to a whole new game and all new controls and systems for how they work. Though I have been playing through with a friend and we have actually been helping each other constantly. Its pretty fun. Ignoring all the issues with the game and taking a step back just to take in the game world, it looks gorgeous. When you are flying in the clouds looking over the countryside or an insanely huge castle it just looks amazing. 

I do wish that my friend and I could play together more, in the fact that a few places are instanced. I feel if you are in a group then it should let you into more stuff together. 

In my opinion a lot of negativity for this game is in itself, false advertising. Just people going over the top upset about something because they just want to be upset with something. I dont think I have seen a single critical argument or where somebody stand in the middle on this. Either people hate the game for 20+ reasons, most of them restatements to build up on their ""I hate the game"" point. Or people that preach the game is godsend. I certainly dont feel it is the best thing out there but it is something new and nice if you can get past the edges. 

For those that dont like the game here is a little statement from me. ""Dont buy it."" Its as simple as that. Dont waste your own money on a game you already have negative feelings about just to whine and cry like a child when it is not a polished piece of gold. 

For those that ARE interested in the game I would certainly say give it a try. It might be a bit pricy for most but I heard the standard edition releasing today will be cheaper as well as refundable if you dont like it. If I didnt like it then I certainly would have refunded it by now.

So this is my review on Bless Online. Its definately got a rocky start with all the issues it has but I see nothing but improvement from here. Here is hoping they are able to keep the game going strong for the years to come.",True,1527697661,1527697661,True,0,1,0.500000,True

I'll try to keep this as short as possible, since I have put in a fair bit of time into this game and I've seen the majority of what there is that they currently have to offer (more on this later).

The MMO community is starving, we've been extremely hungry for a new game to play since there's been absolutely nothing released these last few years.  That being said; all Bless Online needed to be was ""decent"", and I'm sure the game would maintain a decent sized player base in this lull of mmos.  Bless Online was self hyped beyond belief (minimal marketing on Neowiz's behalf) and granted a huge player-base.  All Neowiz needed to do was not be fucking lazy.  If you've done any sort of research on Bless, you would know that the game already failed THREE times.  It's certainly not looking good for the game in the West at the moment and here's why:

[list]
    [*] Horrifyingly bad optimization, no not server lag - I can forgive server lag because I understand what MMO launches are like.  But I'm talking about janky combat stances, micro stutters ingame, lack of fluidity in the UI/interface.  After playing Bless you'll really appreciate how smooth other games like GW2 and WoW are.
    [*] Lack of endgame content - Once you hit max level, there's literally nothing to do; no more progression, no promised open world PvP, no raids, no dungeons. 
    [*] Duping bug - Bless Online's market place is based off a fucking browser, yes, a FUCKING browser.  So it can be easily hacked, ddosed, exploited etc.  This was a KNOWN issue in the previous iterations of Bless and Neowiz has literally done piss all to remedy this.  This just shouts laziness or complete incompetence. 
[/list]

There's more but those are the primary 3 issues I'm sure you get the point.  Anyways I'd suggest anybody who's eyeing Bless to wait, wait for Neowiz to either deliever content and fix things or the game will die in a week.

Foram 90 reais muito bem gastos (tirando os benefícios in game que recebi). A empresa está se dedicando em resolver os problemas dos jogadores e está tentando melhorar a nossa experiência.

Provavelmente vocês não sabem metade da dificuldade que é fazer um jogo. É demorado, é trabalhoso, demanda muito esforço, e é muito ruim você reestabelecer um trabalho para trazê-lo de volta e já receber tantas opiniões negativas sendo que já está alertado (ACESSO ANTECIPADO) que o jogo contaria com problemas.

O gráfico não interfere na gameplay. Se você quer pagar um jogo apenas pelo gráfico, sinceramente, gaste seu dinheiro em outra coisa. Claro, não é um dos melhores proporcionados, mas é aceitável, mesmo para o ano de 2018. Tudo é englobado pelo resto do game.

Fora isto, o game está bem feito, alguns problemas ou outros mas serão resolvidos com o tempo, se tiver interessado em comprar, compre-o sabendo que estará participando da melhoria do jogo, o jogo está ""cru"", está sendo liberado um acesso antecipado para você ir acompanhando o desenvolvimento até o final, quando será realmente liberado.

É isto. Trilha sonora boa, gráficos ok, jogabilidade ok, e muita diversão a ser proporcionada.

The EXCUSE of it being early access is a LIE. This game has been out for YEARS in other regions and they improved/fixed none of the issues. In fact, they made it worse.

For starters I was so excited for Bless Online. I really tried to enjoy it. I really really tried. In the end, I ended up having to request a refund.

Bless Online is unplayable. From the crashes to the FPS issues and constant stuttering, it is infuriating trying to get out of the starting zone. This is if you can make it past the login/character select page without it freezing or having to close out multiple times and re-opening the game. 

Despite all the technical and horrible translation issues, the ""improved"" combat system is absolutely the worst. There is such a huge delay on the combo abilities that the combat seems slow, boring, and more of a chore than anything.

There is a lot of negativity surrounding Bless right now due to many launch issues: groups getting separated after overflowed servers were closed, difficulties getting past a loading screen, and very long queues on the more popular servers. These are frustrating issues, but I think once you get to actually play, it is a fun game with a lot of fun systems. The mount and pet taming is very fun as almost every animal and some monsters are tameable. The taming game is simple, but the ability to level up your pets/mounts and chase after specific skills is a feature that will keep you occupied for a while. The combat is tab targetting based and utilizes set combo chains. I haven't encountered a combat system like it in other games I've played. It is not as exhilirating as the action combat in BDO or as smooth as some other games, but the skills on my mage are fun and there seem to be a lot of new skills to unlock as you level. I'm only level 25 so my dungeon experience is lacking, but the level 22 dungeon is enjoyable and has some mechanics (easy ones, but mechanics nonetheless). I look forward to trying the higher level ones. I don't plan on pvping a ton, so I have no insight into that system. There is a cash shop, but so far it doesn't appear to have anything game breaking in it. I think it's intermediate between BDO's system where there are things you pretty much have to buy and GW2's system where it's pretty much all cosmetic. There also appears to be a system to convert dungeon and pvp tokens into store currency. 

 I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people who are fleeing from their main mmo for various reasons and were expecting this to be the next big mmo. Or people who thought it would be good to buy a $140 founder's pack on a game they knew very little about. It's not polished enough for that, and I do agree that it's not really fair to hide behind the ""early-access"" thing. BUT I am still having a blast. The game is not as broken as people say it is, it just may not live up to people's highest expectations. If you have an mmo you're playing now that you're super in to, this probably won't replace it.

Once I finally got in the poor translation made the game almost unplayable. It was very much a push a button and hopefully stumble across the right one.

Poor combat.
PvP is a mess, the game auto runs you to a target, quick swapping to another target is very awkward.

Cons
===
1. The translation/regionalisation is rough.  It seems Wiz have translated word for word without checking to see if what comes out is actually coherent and explains the story properly.  Also some tool tips etc are off or just plain wrong.  It is early access so I expect this to be polished up by full launch.  

2. Optimisation/performance can be dicey especially in cities on mediocre machines.  A lot of the issues however can be sorted out with a few .ini tweeks that are well documented from other clients.  I have done these and seen my FPS rise to 100+ but I will stress I have a self built VR beast.  Other with ""normal"" machines have seen big increases also.  

The FPS is atrificially capped in the .ini which is one of the issues that is fixed.  Also CPU and GPU resources are limited which is also addressed with the tweaks.  Hopefully Wiz makes some changes so these ""tweaks"" are no longer needed.

Pro's
===
1, BDO style character creation
2. Faction locking (server based) so you can't have characters on both sides on same server.
3. Great combat with ""Action"" mode being rolled out later
4. Gameplay is fantastic
5. Crafting is decent although I have posted suggestions on improvements
6. No where near P2W

Has there been an improvement?
Yes!

I played Bless on both the KR and JP servers. I can 100% say that the game has been improved. 
Just because the game has been improved, it doesn't make the game perfect. 
My first couple hours have been pretty skeptical. The combat felt weird. But it all started to grow on me. Now I think the combat is awesome besides it feeling a little clunky.

I believe Neowiz will continue to improve the game, they kept there word on no pay to win, so why should we not trust them when it comes to bugs and other issues? 

I too was at a point where I thought about refunding, but after hearing streamers talk, I dont want to anymore.
Neowiz will fix there game, they have no choice but to.
The game is also in early access, and yes you can argue that it isnt because its been released 3 other times. But believe it or not it is, they reworked on the game, so it IS in early access, atleast in NA/EU it is.

I have read so many negative comment's saying that they realize that this is an early access game but this has already been out in other market's. True this game has been out in 3 other market's and has failed in all 3 and that is the reason why they have rebuilt the combat system and mechanic's from the ground up and have decided to self publish the game. I am not paid or a fanboy of Bless online and this is the very first time I have played it and I can say that the launch issue's are nothing I have not seen before in other game's and are not as bad as some game's ive experienced as well. And the fixes that they have hatpatched in have been quick and show that they do care about their game's success so far. Is the game worth $30 YEP! is it worth $150 NOPE! (not without being super familiar with who the dev's are) I like to spend more when I can in a game where I know the dev's are good and have thier mind's and heart's are in the right place ie. Warframe.
1. Just go into the game with zero expectations and know that this game has barrowed mechanic's from other MMO's rather than do anything original other than it's combat system which is not as good as other games like BDO (but what game's combat mechanic's compare to BDO?).   
2. Know that this game is early access despite what other commenter's are saying. At the time of this review this version of the game is only two days old.
3. Buy the base game first and then upgrade later if you want to. I personally bought the $70 deluxe edition and honestly don't feel ripped off because I know that I will be playing for a long time to come as long as the dev's address the problems in the same manner as they have in the past couple of day's.
 I think that if you keep all of that in mind then this is a great alternative to what is out there now. This game has great potential but as it is with any other game the longevity of this game is up to the dev's communication and ability to produce more content.

Es ist klar, dass es Probleme gibt...aber bei Bless merkt man, dass die Entwickler aus ihren Fehlern nicht gelernt haben. 

Das Kampfsystem wurde für meinen Geschmack positiv überarbeitet ( habe die RU Version gespielt und das neue Rebuild Projekt in JP). Die Performance Ingame ist leider unterirdisch und nur durch ""fixes"" der Community einigermaßen erträglich.
Man startet das Game und mit Glück landet man direkt im Hauptmenü ( es besteht zur Zeit ein sehr nerviger Bug wo sich das Spiel bereits nach Start in einer Endlosschleife im Splash Screen verabschiedet). Wenn man Pech hat muss man das Game so lange neu starten bis es dann mal geklappt hat ( mein persönlicher Rekord liegt bei 26 mal in Folge). Dieses ist eines der bekannten Probleme und stößt schon sauer auf.
Hinzu kommt, dass nach gut einem Tag die Hauptserver für neue Spieler gesperrt wurden...sprich das Zocken mit Freunden fällt unter Umständen flach.
Ingame trifft man auf massive Performance Probleme, die auch guten Pcs maximal 20fps in Städten erlauben ( hier an große PvP Schlachten denken fällt aus).

Die Warteschlange kann bis zu 3 Std beanspruchen..hat man es dann mal geschafft kommt eine spontane Serverwartung....also wieder von vorne das Ganze...SplashScreen und Warteschlange ich komme.

Ich für meinen Teil gebe jedem Spiel eine Chance und berücksichtige auch jederzeit Early Access usw nur wenn man es so betrachtet wurde das Spiel schon mehrfach rausgebracht und die Fehler vermehren sich anstatt ausgedünnt zu werden.

Die aktuellen Reviews sprechen leider für sich und Valve hat netterweise ihre Refundpolitk angepassst und bisher fast jedem sein Founderspack erstattet wozu auch ich und meine Frau zählen ( 2x Collectors Editon ). 

Die Zukunft für Bless steht leider unter keinem guten Stern. Die Community hat versucht mit den Entwicklern zu sprechen aber eine direkte Antwort blieb bisher aus....

Wer sich selbst ein Bild machen möchte findet genug auf Reddit und Youtube ( große Youtuber zerfleischen das Spiel zur Zeit)...alternativ werft einen Blick auf Twitter #BlessOnline und lest die verzweiflten Hilferufe der Spieler.

Lange Zeit habe ich auf Bless gewartet und viel Hoffnung in dieses Spiel gesteckt von daher werde ich mir nach EA Start die normale 30€ Version zu legen und Ingame verfolgen was sich tut nur die 150€ Version ist definitiv besser bei McDonalds investiert!

I can't even say that i enjoyed the game that much due to all the glitches, poor translation, and combat system.  I bailed at just over two hours hoping to come back if the developers actually finish this game.  I do understand it is Early Access but that is not a free pass on amking a crappy game and having customers finance your slow development process.

Here is my list of gripes:

- Horrendous translation issues (I shouldn't have to Google how to play your broken game)
- Combat system is a bust and chaining fails more often than works. CQB will leave you standing there like an idiot while you get beat down.  Reviewers are stating that this gets ""better"" as you level but how is basic combat broken but advanced combat isn't?  I left the game at 12Level (see what I did there?) and it showed no signs of getting better.
- Early access was a poorly executed joke at best.
- Optimization is crap!  There are so many U3 games on the market that are amazing that there literally is no excuse for not having this game run well.  This is a dev team tragedy and a sign that they are lazy.  If this is the early acces of a game thats been in development for 7 years and deployed in three regions for almost three years, how are we to have any faith that they will ever fix these issues.  If you stick it out, you're a better gamer than me.  I honestly see this game as another DayZ!  Four years in ""Early Access"" is just shameful and Bless is following suit.  All of the problems NA/EU players are experiencing are echoes of what has been published through Russia and Korea reviews.  You'll know the end is near when they start merging servers because of low server pops.

Crafting is generic and straight to the point. Gathering could be better, at leas throw on some nodes on the minimap. Enemies should resapwn faster due to the amount of people murdering them for hunt quests. Either that, or do it like FFXIV where we can all attack the same enemy and get credit for it.
Having to fight to respawns in annoying.

Then you have that infinite splash screen problem...  Which requires multiple restarting of the game. 
Aside from that, the game is fine to me. Though that peace decalartion should definitely last longer, or make a version that is a permanent addition to your inventory so you don't have to deal with PVP nonsense.

For everyone reading reviews and ratings to decide if you want to play this game or not, I highly recommend you check the hours played by the players who have written the hateful reviews. 90% of the negative reviews are from people who have not even played the game because of the queue times at launch, or who have very little playtime. 



About the rumors of no endgame content:

So, a lot of players and emissaries have said that they believe endgame content will not be added until after head start is over in order to prevent people from getting further ahead. In my mind, this makes sense. As even endgame areas like Basel canyon and royal quests were not added yet.



Now as for my opinion on the game and content from playing JP,KR,RU and now NA:

The game is fun. If you're looking for a game that's going to blow your mind, this isn't it. The content is good and fun to do. It's a bit lackluster until 50 patch, but it's still enjoyable.



I'm not going sit here and defend the game, saying that nothing is wrong with it, because there is. The optimization could be a lot better, and the way they handled the servers launch was also done poorly, IMO.

0,97,1,3585,3585,76561198066120567,0,english,False,42386072,"I really really enjoy this game. If you are on the fence about buying this game I would wait a week or two and see how the Devs address some of the issues. With that said I will talk about the pros and cons and cons. 

Pros:
-The combat. i'm sure you are aware by now about the combat. It needs work but it is so fun.
-When it is smooth the game looks great (I will talk about the issues in the cons). 
-Leveling is refreshing and fun. I haven't played an MMO in a long time where I didn't get bored of levling. This game has me pushing to get max level. after almost 25 hours I am close but none of it has felt like a drag.
-Crafting and Taming - the crafting and taming in this game is fun. I find myself going out of the way to pick up more resources without feeling like it is a chore. The taming system is fairly unique and seems like a great chance of pace from farming low percent drop mounts in other games. 
-Open world pvp is a blast! even at level 30 I have run around with a group and pvp-ed. Yes they need to add more to pvp than just open world but from the taste of pvp this gives I am very hopeful. 
-Dungeons are fun. I have 1 dungeon that required a party but it was a blast. I am healing and it is very interactive and even at lower level if one of use messed up we had a chance to all die.

Things I don't understand why people are complaining about:
-No instant teleport to dungeon when using dungeon finder: I get why people are mad because in most other games it is instance, however I dont see why this is a big deal. Old school WoW did not teleport. A big part of the game is open world PvP so why would they limit that when you can teleport places to avoid it. I do think there should be some sort of teleport stone though once a few people are there. 
-Paying cash to revive instantly. Yes, you can pay cash to revive instantly OR you can just walk. which is what most other games just have. If people want to pay not to walk then fine by me but I don't understand complaining when most other games don't even have that option. 
- pay to play. I paid $40 and have alreayd logged 25 hours. I have paid full $60 game price for single player games and beaten stories in 8-10. If you don't have the money it is not their problem it is yours.

Cons:
-Optimization is the big one. There are plenty of reviews that go over this so I won't go into detail, however when the game does run well, it looks great. Personally I haven't had that much issue but that does not mean it is not a problem.
- The game has poor translations for things even as fundamental as skills and tutorials. That is a big issue and it took me a while to do a few of the begining quests because of this. 
- The misrepresentation of content on release. Now, for this hopefully we get a timeline soon (and i mean that for their sake of keeping people who are hopeful). The game was thought to be releasing with action combat but that is only allowed for one class at the moment. Along with this a good bit of the end game content including PvP rankings, arena, and battlegrounds is missing. That has been addressed with a hopeful addition 1-2 weeks after EA release (5/30) but still raises some concerns

With this all said, YES the cons are big ones. BUT they are not unaddressable. Many games on release have had optimization issues (yes i know its already been released in other regions). I am very optimistic about this game. It has great potential, however it is up to the Devs and how they react to the issues and community that will push it further. Like I said before, if you are on the fence, wait a couple weeks to see how it goes. Today on the game will only be $30 which is pretty cheap for a game, if you want to try it out.

Ich bin seit einiger Zeit gespannt auf dieses Spiel und habe mir voller Zuversicht das Deluxe Pack gekauft.
Als Klasse spiele ich zur Zeit ausschließlich die Berserkerin, daher beziehe ich mich nur auf Spielerfahrung mit ihr.

Pro:

- Eine wunderschöne Spielwelt
Gerade für Gleichgesinnte, die neuere Spiele wie BDO für völlig überfüllt halten, sind die freien Straßen der Städte und leicht begehbaren Häuser ein Segen.
Die Welt is farbenreich aber nicht comicbunt, die Charaktere haben einen ganz eigenen Stil und die Kostüme und Rüstungen sind wunderschön gestaltet

- das Kampfsystem
Die Mischung aus Action Cam und Tab Targeting ist einfach genau das, was ich wollte.
Keine 200 verschiedenen Tasten für eine Kombo, keine Fingerverrenkungen, einfach ein flüssiges Kampfgeschehen.
Und dazu noch überaus schnell, Mobgruppen gleich welcher Größe liegen nach wenigen Sekunden geübter Schlagfolgen.

- Pets und Mounts
Das Taming ist eine wahre Wonne. 9:10 Mobs, die man in der Welt antrifft, lassen sich zähmen, um entweder auf ihnen zu reiten oder sie als nützliche Pets mit vielen verschiedenen passiven Buffs mit sich zu nehmen.
Es ist natürlich noch zu früh um abzuschätzen, wie schwer es sein wird, ein besonders angepasstes Pet zu züchten, aber ich hoffe auf viele Stunden tamen und züchten zum perfekten Gefährten ;-))

- Cashshop
Ja der ist für mich ein positiver Aspekt.
In ihm sind ausschließlich kosmetische Anassungen und Items, die einem das Leveln und Farmen beschleunigen.
Für einige mag das zunächst wie P2W klingen, aber durch die winzigen Golddrops der Mobs und das eh schon extrem schnelle Leveln sind diese Items schlicht vollkommen überflüssig.
Die Premium Zeit, die man kaufen kann, gibt einem schon einige angenehme Vorteile, die sich vor allem im Pet- und Mount Züchten niederschlagen - aber solche Boni sind nunmal in beinah jedem Spiel vertreten und spart einem auch wieder nur Zeit.

- Das Interface
Ob es die Übersicht über die Skills ist, das einheitliche Systemmenü oder die einzelenen Funktionsmenüs - alles ist einheitlich gehalten und sehr übersichtlich.
Hier ist anzumerken, dass das Design nicht sonderlich hübsch, sondern sehr zweckmäßig ist.

Nun aber endlich zum Gemeckere^^

Con:

- die Performance
Ob es das ewige Warten in Warteschleifen ist, oder der vergeliche Versuch, überhaupt erst ins SPiel zu gelangen: wie ja überall zu lesen und hören ist, war der Start des Spiel grauenhaft.
Bis dato arbeitet Neowiz mit zahlreichen Wartungen an diesen Problemen.
Das ist nervig, und das kostete einen erheblichen Teil meiner gekauften frühen Spielzeit.
Hier hoffe ich auf ein Compensation, vielleicht in Form einiger Währung? ^^
Mittlerweile wird das Spiel immer stabiler, meine FPS lagen bei 40-60 und Verbindungsprobleme hatte ich kaum mehr.
Es wird...
Die Ini-Fixes und Anpassungen an die Grafikeinstellungen helfen über die Zeit. Danke dafür.

- Founder Items
Mir und vielen, mit denen ich im Chat darüber gesprochen habe, fehlen die Zusatzinhalte, die man für das jeweilige Founder Pack bekommen sollte.
Zwar waren sie in der Accountmail hinterlegt, nachdem ich sie eingesammelt hatte, verschawanden sie hinter einer unleserlichen Fehlermeldung und waren nie weider gesehen.
Hier ist Hilfe gefragt, ein entsprechendes Ticket wurde noch nicht beantwortet, was durch die zahlreichen Probleme natürlich klar ist.

- Übersetzungen und Voiceover
Sowohl die englische Sprachasgabe als auch die deutschen Untertitel sind extrem fehlerhaft.
Teilweise muss man in seiner eigenen Sprahe raten, was denn nun gemeint ist.
Tooltips bestehen teilweise zur Hälfte aus wahllosen Sonderzeichen, Sprachzeilen fehlen - hier bin ich wirklich enttäuscht, war doch gerae diese Portierung von Neowiz so stark angepriesen worden.

- fehlende Action Cam
Wie schon erwähnt spiele ich den Berserker, der gerade durch die Action Cam ein einziges Freudenpacket ist.
Alle anderen Klassen haben diesen Spielmodi allerdings noch gar nicht.
Es gab ein Stzatement von Neowiz, dass diese noch für alle anderen implementiert wertden soll, allerdings ohne Zeitangabe.
Sehr sehr schade.

Alles in Allem bereue ich den Kauf nicht.
Es sind viele Probleme da und Neowiz muss in den nächsten Tagen zeigen, dass sie ihre Spieler halten wollen.

Le Pvp :

je le trouve fort sympathique, il est accessible au lvl 30 dans les zones de conflit, il y a la popo anti Pvp qui est une popo cancert c'est vraiment gonflant.
Certaines classes sont un peu broken mais bon on fait avec.
Pour l'Hl, ils vont mettre au fur et à mesure les arènes, guerre de territoire, au début ça ne sert à rien et actuellement il n'est pas encore sortie pour le reste de la populace.

Vous voulez voir comment sont les premieres minutes de jeu :

But given that ""Bless"" has been an ongoing project since 2012 and released in 3 regions prior to Steam. There has to be some semblance of experience after all these years. Trust me, save your money and wait to see if they turn this game around first. ~60Million dollars was recently spent to launch the game in the west...

Promotion/Marketing- They advertised this game as local, optimized and new combat mechanism. Upon 2-days early (of early) release this is not the case by a long shot. They marketed to your hype and released none of it. Matter of fact they kept hushed about it and removed plenty of content already released in their other areas. I get the lenguage is in the works but the initial quests when a player logs in should be a clean presentation and not a half done job which google translate wouldve done better. Optimzation is just not there....you have to edit your own INI files if you want a semblance of performance out of that Unreal Engine 3/DX9....yeah, a dinosaur. New Combat! after many complained about the ""new"" combat beign removed (except for zerkers) to ""polish"" it more...this...this is not beign transparent after happily stealing DLC money. To make it clear, if they said it in advance, many wouldve been ok in waiting. 

Emmisary event-was used to get you hyped about the game and nearly nothing there is on this early release. Emmisaries were youtubers to try/represent or even help hype the game. Many of them already said there was no official form to give feedback to devs. Apparently some drama went down with them too. Needless to say some already requested refunds and not caring to discard their emissary status. 

Early 2day launch- Needless to say that it was a waste of time. One thing is to wait in queue, another is the launcher failing to connect to their servers and offer you a line-to-wait. Which causes severe closing and relaunch of said option. That's 2008ish issues. As of this post, its still iffy, believe it or not a user in reddit was able to make a quick relaunch of the app if it didnt connect to the servers instead of you sitting there on a staring picture simulation. 

Collectors Edition-Skin/items are all character bound. No way to move them, no way to given them to an alt. With the whole server fiasco and if you got friends trying to join, good luck. Your pack just got wasted. Am ok with character shop bound skins but not founders items for this reason. Also the Lumena in-game currency was character bound, they said to be a known issue while you couldnt use their shop if you wanted more. Problem here is, they never communicated whats a known issue and what isnt...see a trend? In game they warn you its non-refundable! yeah right, people got their money back. Nice try.

Servers- They continually open servers which will likely be empty in due time. Am no tech expert but Amazon servers were used for WoW Legion and was one of the smoothest launches ever seen. So while opening new ones are nice, it splits up pre-made guilds and your precious already burned Founders items. Poor planning and audience disconnect caused a big fail here. Planning of only 1 server vs Oceanic, south america, north america, carribean...get the point?

Roadmap- They have a vague one laid out. Most of it is the same from the 3 other regions. But as i said before they have been lacking in the transparency department while likely hiding under Steams ""Early Access"" policies to bide themselves some time. Therefore many of earlier region content was striped away. Here's the thing, when you meet a person and give that first handshake, that first introduction, it says alot about who you are. Neowiz...who are you becoming? 

Neowiz-Overall there have been games that pulled through and made it work. Do you know what they did differently? Open forums, discussions, podcasts, whatever to get in touch with that audience and show what your plans are with...transparency. Warframe and FF14 are to name a few here. You have been hearing feedback, yes, but still behind a closed door with ears covered until its loud enough to say ""i heard you"". Come out of that closet, face us more often and get that feedback and just talk...talk to your audience that may want to support you instead of yor emmisaries that are jumping ship. Also, lets say your afraid, you dont want to face an audience, then open a communication channel where your emissaries can leave proper feedback and something more direct you can respond to them with.

In short, i cant advise this game to anyone until further notice and hopefully by the time you (Neowiz) make a ""change"" its not too late because another competition or game will have our attention. At that point, what happens to you?
Should you prove to turn this around and do better, then ill update my review. Just no until then, moneys is better spent elsewhere when you couldve made this a beta to help you test instead of a non-refund early of early release lack of transparency you tried.

Original Post May 30th.
Edit and follow up 6/6

Hmmm where to start. I still would'nt suggest this game to any of my friends or anyone. Make your own informed decision for what $30-$150 is worth to you. 

Soon after this post above did we actually get a letter of apology about the state of the game's release. From there a few patches, that as i mentioned above, catered to whomever yells the loudest. Some of these changes are beign thrown way too casually with a full slider of dps nerf to full slider hp mob nerf.  Not to mention that each patch ""note"" doesnt include full disclosure still. For example, first two dungeons used to drop gear, guaranteed, each boss. Now it doesnt to match end level dungeons where you have RNG of a drop rate for RNG of it beign of your class. 

Events! Boy are they throwing events left and right. The last gather/crafting event is nice to push people to buy those inventory slots or alt-bank. Content is missing end game so these events are to distract you as best possible. I for one would like release of already made content from the other regions with performance improvement as promised. DX11 was actually asked of them and yet they werent sure about it. Further confirms as a vague roadmap as i mentioned above. 

Dupe items scandal. It was an actual issue on other regions client and fixed. It demonstrates a rolled back build, further showing that its the same earlier slate from other regions but with removed content. Not a full rework. FF14 went through a reboot phase that you can actually tell. As for those involved in the duping, few days ban and items were kept. So they say. 

Apparently they are listening to feeback through their Discord and with some emissaries. I fear the feedback is way too one sided and not properly compiled or prioritized in the right ways. Performance is still an issue where they guaranteed something would happen within 2 weeks. Perfomance has been the key main factor in all the regions. Performance,  performance, ~60 Million later, perfomance...They already stole your money (and mine) with lack of transparency. Whats a few ""please wait, more soon"" to make you more gullible?

Sometimes the wrong feedback is given by the wrong audience (twitter, reddit). The fault was in the devs team mostly for releasing a game where classs could 1-shot things. Now that adjustments make sense, no one understands or is taking the time to understand how combo/links system works. Its a fairly simple concept if peeps slow down, read, practice. But they seem addicted to preference already.

Latest news as of writing this is the collectors edition. They show to stand on their claim for a character bound and not account bound. This on its own is unnecessary to founders. Gold is account bound and am willing to bet that's an issue on the code, unintended. Yet the in-game dollar-currency, Lumina is not.",True,1527695396,1528293780,False,0,2,0.523810,True

The battle system is VERY fun and VERY rewarding for skilled players. I can't wait to try it out in serious PvP situations other than duels.

Hearing there is a lack of content once you hit 45, I'm not so concerned with this because Neowiz already has content pretty much ready to roll-out just need to wait a bit for it.

The biggest problems: Obvious... optimization issues. However we're in an era where all these tiny-shit companies are constantly releasing these games early and apparently we just have to deal with it. My tip not only for Neowiz, but for all dev companies, FINISH YOUR FUCKING GAMES, THEN SELL THEM! Isn't that how business is supposed to work? We pay good quality money for a FINAL PRODUCT.

0,103,10,5659,5659,76561198095934926,1,english,False,42385972,"First, all the flamers here on Steam, i have no words what happened to the Gamer community these days. It was pretty obvious that the game has some problems on Launch, Like every other game in the world too.

So does bless had a better launch/EA then most games?
-Hell Yes! In other games i couldnt even login the first few days when the game was out, on some games i couldnt even install or download the first days.

[h1]Bless Launch/EA 7 PM 28th May 2018[/h1]
[list]
    [*]I could download the game without problems, ofcourse it was a bit slow but at 9PM game was ready.
    [*]Yes there was a problem that you couldnt past ""Loading screen"", but if you inform yourself on Steam/Twitter/Reddit you would know how to fix it (run BlessLauncher.exe as administrator - change screen resolution in option file)
    [*]On EU the server worked fine, but then after a while you got a ""High ping""/""delay"" for looting monsters/completting quests. Is that ok? Yes it is. IN most games you would crashed/disconnected instead.
[/list]
[b]So to summ it up: the Bless Launch wasnt that bad as some crying kids describing it. - I could LOGIN, Create my Character and even play on the FIRST day of Launch, yes it was a bit laggy but total fine for a launch. [/b]

[b]Also im a bit shocked that the Gamer community these days Review a Game based on Server problems/performance.[/b]

Currently im enjoying Bless Online for me its the WoW/BDO/Aion Killer.
Yes i know the grafic are not the best, but they are fine.

[h1][b]Pros (+)[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]You can tame like everything to get a pet/mount
[*]The battle system in bless online is pretty awesome. Its not that fast then bdo and not that slow then FF, its a mix of tab target + action + combos. It reminds me a bit of Cabal Online. I like the battle system.
[*]The Character Creation is pretty damn awesome. You can change nearly everything, The Character Creation is similar to BDO's with less Face options, but Much more/Better Color opions. You can choose hair/eye/lipstick color bassed on Farbcode (HEX e.g[#ffdd99]) -> Bless is a Custom Maid/Waifu simulator :)
[*]No gender locks
[*]The idea haveing 2 big factions fighting agains each other was always nice. Shaiya had it, WoW had it and it was always hyped/loved/enjoyed by the players
[*]The Cashshop is one of the most fairest Cashshop i ever seen, its like Path of Exile. NO p2w! Only Fashion, Invslots and other convenience stuff
[*]Leveling/Progressing with dungeonds/quests are better for most people then just grinding mobs
[*]The Game is Casual friendly
[/list]

[h1][b]Cons (-)[/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]The Game is focused on 1 Main Character, most is charbound - someone like it someone not.  
[*]The localisation/translation is not completed/missing/wrong
[*]The game is not optimised for 60 FPS+
[/list]

[h1][b] So my conclusion:

If you are one of the players that like the oldschool holy-trinity MMOS (Tank,DD,Heal). you loveing the idea of Faction vs Faction, are not afraid of taming monsters and can enjoy games with 30-60fps - Then give it a try. Bless is for you :)

If you are one of the players that want to push their  ego with expensiv hardware and reach 144 FPS+ on your 144hz screen and doesnt like slow combat - Then bless is not for you. Then you can go back to WoW or other games :)

El juego me gusta, tiene graficos decentes, el sistema de combate es interesante, las clases si bien no aportan nada nuevo son divertidas, ya anunciaron futuras clases para un futuro cercano y de por si pareceria NO ser pay to win.

Lo positivo: Se que el juego es bastante bueno, parece divertido, lo poco que jugue me gusto y a pesar de la pesima optimizacion que tiene como casi todos los juegos cuando salen se que a futuro va a mejorar haciendo la aventura mucho mas agradable. Debo reconocer que de las 9 horas que tengo registradas con suerte jugue 3 debido al bug de la pantalla de carga pero lo poco que vi me gusto, necesita un poco de trabajo, el juego recien sale y me parecio algo injusto puntuarlo negativo en base a la pesima experiencia del DLC comprado ya que es un tema aparte. Me encanta la idea de que a nivel 30 se pueda pelear contra usuarios de otra faccion en casi cualquier lado.

Lo negativo es que pague el DLC para jugar 2 dias antes y NO PUDE jugar porque todo el tiempo se me trababa en la pantalla de carga por lo cual desperdicie mi dinero completamente, si se pudiese puntuar por separado le pondria la menor calificacion al DLC y una calificacion buena al juego. Ademas por lo que sale el DLC me parece un INSULTO que no pueda usar los items en todos mis personajes, solo con el que lo active, lo cual es ridiculo porque me das 2 skins de monturas para y 2450 monedas premium pero para 1 solo personaje cuando TRANQUILAMENTE podria ser para mi cuenta en general.

A futuro estare pendiente de actualizaciones y en base a eso actualizare mi review, le tengo fe al juego, no lo quiero asesinar desde el comienzo por un mal DLC, creo que TODOS deberiamos soportar algunas fallas al momento de salir por mas que no deberia suceder, me remito a la frase tipica: '' No lo justifico pero lo entiendo ''.

[b]Things to note before reading[/b]
- I decided not to play the other versions to spare myself spoiling any aspect of the game
- I have a large amount of patience
- I am aware of how most of the issues are being handled
- This game is in EA, not release

[b]Combat[/b]
Personally I feel that the combat, although a little awkward at times because of finger placement on the keyboard, is great. I understand that it isn't fully streamlined and the fluidity of combat could be a little better for all classes. (Personally I only play archer at the time of this review) The combat system definitely takes some getting used to as your are constantly using skills without auto-attacks, which is actually good in my opinion for the reason that you are always actively using skills. Likewise, stance swapping is a great combat mechanic as it not only allows you to change your skill set in the middle of battle, ultimately changing how you play, but the fact that it gives you buffs and that your required to swap stances if you want to continue attacks. Now the reason why this is beneficial is that it promotes dynamic playstyles and helps to improve your combat awareness because based on the skills you choose. Also, who doesn't want buffs. In terms of PvE, since you have the ability to move while casting/ executing MOST skills, some require you stand still, it makes dodging mobs easy while you continue to DPS them. Other than that, I have yet to go into combat with other players so I won't be reporting on that.

[b]Translation[/b]
I'm going to make this clear, translation is a thing that can be worked on for nearly any game that is ported, this isn't something you really need to worry about as there are many players in-game who will assist you in the help chat.

[b]PvP[/b]
Said I wouldn't report on it, but I can tell you that it needs reworking due to extremely high damage. 

[b]Server Stability[/b]
Okay yes, we all know that people are not playing because:
- Queue times 
- Splash bug
- Disconnects
- Character locks
- Etc.
Yes, I know. We all know. Now here's why it doesn't matter and what people should understand: 
- Queue times exist because people are trying to connect to x server. Now lets say z is the players connecting the server, the inflow of players, and y is the people disconnecting, the outflow. To explain, a queue accumulates because z can't connect to the server because there is no y. The inflow of players increases while the outflow rarely moves because of players afking in-game instead of logging out. Yes there should be an AFK timer as it would help resolve this issue.
- Splash bug. This is an authentication issue where too many request are being sent so a lot are being dropped, just try to reconnect and reload the game. It's being looked into so I wouldn't worry.
- Disconnects. Some are from server crashes that are emergency restarts, some are MA that people just don't realize. Sometimes the game does legitimately drop you, however, that is being looked into as well.
- Character locks. Some servers have character locks because the server is full and/ or over capacity. The locks aim to distribute the player base evenly across all servers. Eventually these locks will come off.
- Optimization will be improved on as the game goes on, like every other game

[b]Transparancy[/b]
Yes, there needs to be more.

I didn't follow any of the press release and I only saw this game when it showed up on steam on May 28. Some aspects seem dated, but the most trouble I run into—if ever—is getting the program to start (either because I was trying to switch the resolution or sometimes being stuck at the Bless screen before it hits the main menu) these issues have largely been taken care of since then (for me). The auto path is kind of funny as it often goes a roundabout way of doing these things. 

I've only played Guardian, but it seems like fun and I am not getting wrecked by everything. The combo system is a bit strange with tab targetting, but I have gotten used to this over time. The translations are sort of messed up when it comes to viewing/studying your abilities, but I've been able to manage so far. I'm also very patient when it comes to these things. I'm on NA server and don't see a lot of problems, although those in the EU seem to be having more server issues from what I hear. I think the game has potential, but I hear that it's supposed to be largely focused on PVP at endgame. The main quest levels you up fast enough and there are plenty of side quests to take care of when you go to new areas. 

I'd suggest giving it a shot. The only gripe I've had so far is the toxic chat with everyone complaining about one thing or another. Maybe I just lucked out and the game works fine for me. 

If people want to play BDO then go play BDO. It's a fine game in its own right.

Positivas:
- O Jogo em si ta bonito, muitos reclamaram de fps mas joguei com 40 ~50 de fps sem problemas e foi o suficiente para curtir o jogo (quando consegui logar).
- Curti o combate com chain skills e o esquema de build.


Negativas:
- Os desenvolvedores começaram com somente 2 servidores e foram lançando outros depois por causa da super lotação, esqueceram que muitas vezes vem guilds inteiras e quem já tinha criado nos 2 primeiros servidores lançados ia arrastar o restante pra onde eles já estavam jogando, o que gerou filas beirando 3k de players ou até ultrapassando, e a solução foi bloquear criação de char em determinado servidor para os que já tinham criado conseguissem jogar no acesso antecipado. E graças a isso separou e causou problema para muitos clãs e fez com que muita gente desistisse do jogo.
- Erro na tela inicial do jogo, esse pra mim foi o mais irritante! Ter que ficar fechando e abrindo direto (e detalhe que o jogo demora para abrir) tive que ficar procurando na internet 'mandingas' para poder fazer carregar e aparecer os servidores.
- Camera do jogo (mas já justificaram , só esperando patch com correção).

Continuo com o jogo porque gostei e sei que eles arrumando essas falhas que teve no acesso antecipado e melhorando a capacidade do servidor que estou jogando o Tanara, tem tudo pra ser um jogo bem divertido com pve desafidor coisa que não tenho faz tempo em mmo.

There were issues connecting to game, disconnects, severe lag and many people got stuck at  the title screen for hours at a time.   All that being said, Neowiz has been very active in resolving those issues by opening new servers and conducting efficient maintenance that has greatly improved gameplay in a very short period of time, which shows they seem to be fairly responsive.

Now about the game:  People seem to be complaining about optimization, duping and other things that I've personally not encountered.  That doesn't mean its not true...just that my game play has been different.  What I have found is that the world is rather pretty and I have no issues running the game on medium to medium high settings with good fps so I can enjoy the view.

The combat mechanics are refreshingly different.  I like the chain abilities and having to decide, which set of chain abilities to use based on resources and situation.  It's not just mash the same serious of buttons in order over and over again.  There is also the taming mechanic that I find a bit addictive.  I seem to need to tame everything I see whether I need it or not.  There is also a variety of quest options that include your main quest line, side quests, hunt quests and what I call tutorial quests (quests that teach you about different aspects of the game).  There are solo dungeons as well.  I've only gotten to lvl 17 so I've not explored endgame offerings yet but so far leveling hasn't felt all that grindy and the story line is fairly interesting.

The game is in a rough patch currently.  As with most MMO releases this one has had its issues as well.  The biggest concern at the moment seems to be optimization issues.  The devs have said they are currently prioritizing optimization and stability over other issues, which is fine I feel.  In regards to bugs I havent experienced any myself but have heard of a few people having issues.  Server queues can get pretty high, however it seems they have dynamic servers so there always seems to be an open server with little to no queue.  There are a handful of broken translations also that I am hoping they get to fixing, but nothing to terrible.

CASH SHOP
The next big question everyone has been asking about and assuming is, ""is the cash shop pay to win"".  I'm happy to say that it is not pay to win.  There are simple convenience items such as teleporting scrolls, xp boosters, inventory/character expansion, cosmetics, etc... all of the enhancement items are purchased with ingame currency that you get through gameplay and pvp.

GAMEPLAY
Gameplay wise I'm honestly having a blast with the combat.  As of writing this review I've managed to make it to level 33 and am still really enjoying myself.  Another issue that has cropped up is that as people are hitting the level cap they are finding that a lot of the endgame content is disabled.  When asked about this the devs stated they are working on optimization before rolling out the addition end game content.

ENVIRONMENT
The game itself is honestly really pretty to look at especially at higher graphical settings.  The music is also really, really nice.  It's not very often that I actually enjoy the music from Korean mmos.  The different zones are really fun to look at.  I usually hate desert areas but I found myself really appreciating what they managed to do with this one.  I really just want to go explore and experience all the little off the path areas regardless of whether they contain anything or not.

CONCLUSION
Overall, the game has its issues; optimization and stability, lack of current endgame content, low difficulty, translations, but it also really shines in other areas; environment, combat, music a familiar feeling.
Do I recommend it?  Yes, I do.  Should you buy it right now?  Perhaps not.  I feel they need a little more time to really hammer out all of the issues.  Optimization first then adding and making sure all the endgame content is added smoothly and I think we will have a really good game by the end of it.

Tl;dr 
Game is really fun, combat, environment, music, all great.  Current optimization and translation issues, no true endgame at the moment.  Recommended? Yes.  Buy it now? No.  Wait for the big issues to be fixed first, then give it a go.",True,1527694632,1527694632,True,0,1,0.523810,True

Ja ""Warnung"" mag reißerisch klingen, aber vor Bless Online muss einfach gewarnt werden. Das Spiel hält so gut wie keine Versprechen:

- Es gibt keine deutsche Sprache (bis auf einige wenige Untertitel)!
- Selbst die Texte, Interface, etc. in Englisch sind so grottig in das Englische übersetzt, dass es schwierig ist, sogar durch das Tutorial zu kommen, da man schlicht nicht versteht, was das Spiel von einem möchte.
- Die Performance des Spiels ist unterirdisch schlecht ... durch das pausenlose Geruckel stellen sich irgendwann Kopfschmerzen ein.
- Die Serverstruktur ist ein Witz - es gibt ständig Verbindungsabbrüche und meist bleibt das Spiel dann beim Ladebildschirm hängen.
- Das ""überarbeitete"" Kampfsystem ist ungemein unbequem und fühlt sich einfach nur träge und nicht durchdacht an.

Meiner Meinung nach wurde an Bless Online rein gar nichts verbessert - man versucht hier ein jahrealtes, schlechtes Spiel noch einmal auf den Markt zu bringen, um Kohle abzugreifen. Das ist beinahe Betrug.

In addition marking the checkboxes on the exe file properties compatibility tab for disabled full screen enhancements (thanks windows) and the stupid DPI scaling (again, thanks windows) and you'll see immediate improvements.

That being said:

Combat is actually quite fun - even post damage nerf.  I find a lot of people have no idea how the combo system works.  You reach the end of a combo chain in one stance, then switch over to your other stance and finish it out.  This is what lets you get up to 7 and 8 chain combos and with each part of the chain your damage increases.  As a guardian (tank class) I've been able to take out groups of 3 or 4 with no problem, in short order, by simply comboing in such a way that my aoe damage is hitting 7th or 8th in the chain and smashing mobs for almost 50% of their health.  The people complaining loudly about the damage nerf are the ones that just spam 1-3 without ever utilizing the combo system's R, T, and Y hot keys.

Bless is a THEMEPARK.  This isn't a a sandbox, so if you go into it expecting that you won't be happy.  The main quest line is decently voice acted but the quests aren't anything to write home about.  They're interesting enough if you read them but they're pretty standard.  Crafting is fairly run of the mill as well.

The first solo dungeon I did was a load of fun on my guardian.  Bosses rewarded AWESOME xp and the provided fights that weren't too long and even some telegraphs you needed to avoid or you'd die in short order.  

Each race has it's own starting zone - not something you see done in many MMOs these days.

Optimization aside, the graphics are really nice to look at - even at the lowest settings.  Turn down dynamic shadows though, it's a real resource hog.

The taming system is awesome.  It's easy to understand how to tame things and the amount of things you can tame is amazing.  I love being able to tame the various beasts I see and ride them around as mounts or summon them as little companions.  As you upgrade them they unlock passive boosts as well.

People complaing about the launch... have you never been a part of a big mmorpg launch? hello? they are always shit and this was actually one of the smoothest launches , I'm guessing NA got totally dumpstered because 3 or 4 big streamers played it(the ones I can name off the top of my head are Shroud, Asmingold , Sodapoppin) and everyone was trying to streamsnipe them in the same damn server obviously no server is gonna be able to handle thousands of people trying to log onto it at the same time just to streamsnipe some guys. other servers however (Talking about EU where I was) the most popular server was actually fairly stable after like 2 maintanaces on the first day I played for a solid 18-20 hours before the next maintanace and then I played another 30 or so hours , so the launch was very much very stable and smooth with devs fixing it really fast , just NA got screwed over by the streamers.

Pros
------
The combos of the classes are intresting
Taming is a pretty cool feature if you like that monster you could tame it to be a mount or pet depends on if its a wheel or wing thing.
Group pvp in open world is quite fun
Flying mounts are quite rare so you wont see people flying around ruining open world pvp.
Leveling is extremely fast compared to other mmorpgs if done correctly it will take 20 hours to hit max level

Cons
------
UI isnt that great
Translation is terrible
Game has bad dips in fps but after editing the ini file it works just fine no more dips in fps
Swear filter is a joke

Alot about this game has been saying its a bad game and such because of breaking bugs and such well its launch day. Yes this is the 4th launch of the game but its a b2p model with no p2w in the cash shop instead of f2p with p2w features.
You should give the game a try the first few hours are horrible I will say that but I think its not that bad of a game compared to others. Also a lot of the content is missing as of right now but I see it being changed in this version due to this the last chance they have with this mmorpg genre with the company and they seem to care about the players responding to them.


Like if i would have to rate the game I would rate it like this.
Graphics 4/10
Gameplay 5.5/10
Story 2/10
PvP 7/10

I would rate the game as a overall of 5/10 its not like a amazing like that was hyped and people are shocked that it wasnt good at content that day. There was people that rushed to max level without the 2 days before launch. Also the game was laggy because they only had 2 servers and they had to open more servers because they didnt expect that many players to play the game.",True,1527694235,1527694235,True,0,1,0.523810,True

Pros + Really fun quest line
        + If you read reddit you'll find fps fixes, so you can higher your quality and the game looks absolutely amazing.
        + Almost every monster is tamable, so you can have some fun with your mounts! :D
        + A free global chat so you never really get lonely.
Cons
        - had a really bad launch
        - You have to go to reddit to look for fps fixes, even for high end pc's.
        - You'll die a lot if you aren't experienced at MMO's, the learning curve is high!

0,27,1,8666,8666,76561198027662099,0,english,False,42385579,"This review is coming from someone who played for the majority of their listed playtime (currently 43 hours. About 7 of those I was afk sleeping and left the game on, and I only had 1 queue which was less than 2 hours). I play Berserker on the most populated server Tanara. 

I no-lifed the hell out of this game and was blissfully unaware of the insanely negative vocal minority, so I'm writing this review to say THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY THE GAME! I think the crux of that is actually getting into the game, past the garbage splash bug, and the 3000 person queue. I have sympathy for the people who can't get around these things. I have a clan member who can't even get into our server and it sucks. I understand that frustration and I'm hoping that is fixed soon. 

As someone who has gotten into the game consistently though, I really, really like it. Maybe it's nostalgia glasses for Aion or just desperation for an MMO and jaded with the current state of korean mmos. Plausible. BUT if you're like me and you: loved rifting in Aion - exploring off the map to find kisk spots, open world pvp, want a classic MMO with new fresh touches (combo combat is something to get used to), wanna catch em all (i'm obsessed with mount and pet collection right now), and are tired of the p2w of other eastern mmos, this is a great game for you. 

Saying ""this game isnt as bad as that game"" isn't without its faults. I know my coming from a soft p2w MMO (BnS) is having an effect on my experience with Bless. But if you're in the same boat, I think you'll be VERY happy about the way cash shop elements are handled at the moment and it'll be somewhat refreshing for you, and exciting too. From my perspective nothing about this game is p2w and its barely p2convenience (the definitions of p2w and p2c or p2progress vary for people. for me blade and soul is pay to win and pay to progress. bless is truly p2c, just because premium gather tools are so nice AND CONVENIENT lol). I also want to support developers who publish their own game, that's awesome and I want to see this keep happening because in the long run it helps the players.

Anyway I don't blame people for being angry, people who bought head start packs and couldn't even play during headstart. It absolutely sucks. But I hope people in the future give this game a chance. Don't get entirely discouraged by the negativity. MMO launches are always hot garbage and it sucks, IT SUCKS. But the game itself, in my opinion, is worth playing.

0,12,2,4041,4041,76561198088784608,0,english,False,42385575,"Considering this is currently in a early access state for a beta version of the game, I feel this is worth sticking with, though there are some issues, but nothing as serious as issues other mmo's have had on launch more or less pre launch beta.

The bad: 
Translation issues of the game. Most notably in the tutorial section is prety bad. Once past the tutorial I havn't had any issues understanding quests, or following dialogs. Nothing too much worse then I have seen in other games, and those games had the benefit of being published by a western company.  But the totorial is difficult to get through due to the translations and can leave a bad initial impression I feel many reviewers are getting hung up on.

FPS issues. The game does not have hardware detection at this point and as a resuklt has several settings that are not ideal for performance. Out in the world I noticed a slight frame rate loss, and in crowded player areas this became prety bad. But After making a few minor edits to the ini iles the world fps issue is prety much gone, and I only see lag in the most croded citties. So prety typical of any mmo with a high population at launch after those edits. And to be completly honest, I dont recall playing any mmo where I havnt gone into the ini files  to tweek settings for performace. So this wasnt anything abnormal for me. 

The so so:
The combat is different then anything I have seen in the past. I have played many mmo's but not every mmo. So maybe its just new to me. But the combo system along with the tab targeting for my class has added a significant challenge to combat that standard tab and rotation combat lacked While avoiding the face rolling mindless button mashing of most typical action combat systems. The default combo keys, RTY are not ideal. Rebinging them to more easily accessable keys was needed in my case. So the good of this is the combat system is very engaguing, requires quick decission making and targeting priority skills. The bad side is it can feel awkward at first, and I have died more times in this game starting off due to my lack of speed or poor decision skills then In any other game. Though thats becomming less and less of a issue as I get better with the combos.  

The Good:
The game looks great even at the lowest graphics settings.

The plot is easy to follow even if you skils scenes, but still entertaining enough. Its not a best seller knovel, but its good for a game.

The cash shop doesnt have any pay to win items as far as I can see. Pets, mounts and costumes mainly. Thier is also items like pickaxes and basic supplies in the cash shop but nothing you cant buy for cheaper ingame at a merchant with in game currency, or craft / sell on the auction.

Key systems seem to be well developed and thought out. Guilds have leveling, zone control, waring, and other features. Crafting and gathering seems to be well thought out, you can tame most mobs as either pets or mounts via a mini game. Skill progression is a bit different but seems nicely complex. etc..
 
The launch has gone very smoothly in my opinion. While they could havce probably launched with 2 or 3 servers right off, they have been able to add servers on the fly with only a hour of down time here and there. The loading screen can hang, but simply relaunch a few times and you can ushualy get right in (patch noptes from today says this should be fixed). There has been a que but most of the time even when starting at 1000+ it has taken about 5-20 minutes to get in but not hours or days or weeks. This compared to other games leads me to feel this has been a prety well handled launch. 

Good community response, handling issues from the community so far has been prety quick from what I have seen. 

So in conclusion I would recommend this game considering its priced well, and overall has been an enjoyable experienmce. Its a mostly standard mmo thats fairly well developed compared to whaty you normally see at a launch.",True,1527694164,1527694164,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Sometimes it takes up to 10+ tries for the game to show up the servers (huge waste of time and patience - over 6h wasted in this + server queues).

Instability - huge fps drops, even crashes by using marketplace, despite i have edited certain settings manually from the game ini files. HUGE amounts of server lag

The product is not as advertised - lack of endgame content (battleground/arenas), issues that were promised to be fixed from previous editions such as optimization/gameplay are in a HORRIBLE state. No endgame other than two dungeon. Its more like a game in alpha state than a game promising a polished release.

[u]Will update once i got to play more :)[/u]

The game is beauriful and the story so far seems great !
i am BLESSed to finally get to play this game even though it has its issues in the beginning.
People clearly haven't experienced what early access and newly launched games means. It means; Crashes, server issues, FPS issues and so on. our pre-paid money (hopefully) goes to fix this as soon as possible.
I'm gonna write a short rewiev NOT based on launch errors like EVERY online game has.



[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- Combat is nice and smooth
- Questing is made easy
- voiceacting is okay
- Graphics looks nice (shame with the fps issues)
- side quests and monster hunting !
- Crafting and gathering is quite alright.
- TAMING PETS AND MOUNTS ?!
- Challenging; Do not overpull and watch your mana/energy !! <3

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- Needs more graphical changes and optimizing like Vsync etc.
- Can't change much on the UI (Changing map size, placement of actionbars etc)

My opinion:I enjoy the game very much.
What I detail below as cons are definately not a dealbreaker for me.

Pro:
1. Voice acting is on par.
2. Graphics to me are astounding.
3. Content is good for my playstyle and keeps me busy.
4. The monster hunt quests are a good addition to the questing side (for those PvE lovers).
5. Movement (and auto-pathing) is alright -as long as you are not accustomed to a certain type or accept a game movement for belonging to it
6. Map is very useful as it helps with knowing where things are as well as helpful for movement routes.
7. Conversing through the various chat tabs is easy and filled with the usual MMO chatter.
8. The pet/tame system is very cool.
9. Through quests you can get currency that can be exchange for a small amount of real money currency daily.

Neutral:
1. Target system is old school tab-target with some action elements: need to face target to attack, monsters have attack direction markers.
2. Instructions for all things are spread throughout the story which means not everything is accesible during the beginning. 
3. Skill usage system is different than what we may be accustomed to.
4. Inventory size can be an issue.
5. Map or mini-map does not show creatures.

Con:
1. UI is currently locked for editing.
2. Skills cannot be changed from location, which means if you want AoE you have to cast the 1 or 2 skills preceeding it.
3. Classes are currently being rebalanced.
4. Not reading instructions or quests -or during quests- creates havoc and confusion among players .
5. There is a learning curve for most things in the game.
6.. Market manager (Auction House) has a trick (if white screen right click a sell-able item from inventory to activate sell feature; this usually solves it), if you don't know it you may be stuck with a white screen.
7. There are workarounds for a few workarounds in Reddit concerning (more below).

Now yes I have had a lot of troubles getting on the game (~100mins of restarting because of the Bless screen) but outside of that issue I have experienced almost no other game breaking issues. Yes the performance is not the best, but hello? We're in Early Access day 3 now. And believe me since today (30th of May) I have experienced almost no issue at all regarding my performance.

So if you like MMORPG's in a High Fantasy setting. By all means do give this game a solid chance.

To the game:
in my opinion its a good game. i have a lot of fun, the combat is smooth. I am not a grinding fan but in this gane it would be no problem for me because the combat is fun and fast. im playing a mage and i like it that you can move while casting  :-)
you jump around, you cast a spell and there are lots of instant skills and the combo skills are great too. its no action combat like bdo or tera but its fun and for all who say tab targeting fighting is boring, its not in this game.

The fact that you can tame nearly all animals is also really great, you see a lot of different mounts and pets.

For all who are interested in the game, read reviews to the game notabout performance, laggs or serverproblems.
the devs are working fine, a lot of updates at twitter and remember this is an early access, its like a beta version and normally betas are there for testing. the devs are trsting and learn with their mistakes. they open more server or make character creation restrictions for servers. 

for all players who cant live with some laggs or bugs (remember its early acces) just refund. but dont write a bad review just because you are mad.",True,1527693520,1527693520,True,0,2,0.517986,True

Alrighty. 
So I've been following this game for a little while now, dabble ever so slightly in the JP release and so on, and I gotta say I am enjoying it. Though this is just my opinion. I find the game delivered what I was promised, and even a little more in some aspects. This game happened to be exactly what I was looking for, and came in at the right time.
I'd personally rate this game an 8 out of 10, and that number will likely rise as I keep playing. 

Grinding the dungeons, (some) NPCs, crafting and messing around with your friends in the beautiful enviroment... I legit couldn't ask for more. I have only two complaints, being
1. [i] No Iframes on mages blink	[/i]. I get caught to many times by guardians shield charge and one shot too often because of this.
2. Grinding for stone so I can make taming scrolls is a nightmare due to low amount of nodes and their horrid respawn rates. Once everyone figured out you need stone for scrolls, I've struggled getting enough for 6 scrolls in 2 hours.

Other notes:
I enjoy the combat system. Finding good combos, and putting them to use and praying you dont miss a shot is great in my mind.
Exploration is fun and wonderful. Nothing feels like its too far away, and looking at the wonderful world built by neowiz is pretty litty
Crafting: I've never crafted in a game in my life, and this is the first. I've actually enjoyed it, which is odd for how sour I am against hardcore grinding like that
PVP is fun for casuals like me
Its easy to make a lot of friends from, lets say complaining about stone drops
Translations are hilarious
Runs perfectly fine on my medium tier system on medium graphics, and never had the need to mess with the INI file for optomization 
It is easier to get lumena for free then I thought it would be
Mob diversity, and taming is really really fun, despite how little I've actually tamed.

Anyone reading that trash, please be aware the game isn't even out for Early Access yet and has only had its 2 days of Headstart. Normal Early Access starts in a few hours, and Live release doesn't occur for a few more months. Most of these neg reviews are from overhyped whiners expecting this game to run like a Live AAA title that's past the first month of rush. People who expected a smooth and totally optimized game during the headstart of an early access game need to check their privilege. Im having a blast despite the expected and reasonably handled hiccups.

FPS locked at 60: easily fixed with a .ini tweak. If you're going to whine that the game isn't optimized, maybe you should wait until the official LIVE release in a few months before giving a negative review based off your inappropriate expectations.

Lag and server crashes? Yea if you didnt expect that on Day 1 during the rush, you haven't played many MMO releases before. By Day 2 most of the lag was resolved for me, and the game ran smoothly for at least 95% of my play-time yesterday.

Stuck at ""Bless"" logo screen: Yep, this is a problem. The client failed to connect to the overloaded server and doesn't have proper ""retry"" logic. Either keep trying or go play something else until Bless fixes it and ask for compensation for missing your 2-day headstart. For me, it was a minor annoyance. I'd be more pissed if it had been like this for weeks, but again, we are 1.9 days into pre-Early Access.

Combat is a fun hybrid between action combat like BDO and a more traditional MMO button masher. The hits feel addictively substantial and reactive. There are a lot of day old reviews here criticizing the combat... Dude, you've been playing for less than 12 hours and prob havent even had to learn how to switch stances in combat yet.

Graphics: I think they're fine. Not BDO level, but not bad in my opinion. If you need gorgeous, this isn't your game, but if you're content with ""pretty good"", then here ya go.

Audio: meh. If you're a major audiophile, pass on this game unless you want a laugh. But it gets the job done if you're not.

Translations: yep, there are some hilariously bad moments in the translation, like my skill that says it reduces the cooldown cooldown but simultaneously raises the cooldown cooldown... But 90% of the text and audio is fine.

UI: feels normal to me. I see room for improvement, but I won't judge until Live Release in a few months.

My biggest con: I am FLYING through the PVE content. I am worried I'll run out of PVE stuff within a few weeks, and I'm not spectacular at PVP, but we'll see what the future holds.

For those wondering should you buy the game? Thats not a question I can answer but for me. I dont think Ill come back unless things really start to shine such as:

-Server merge or not locking characters on specific characters(What is this? Archeage? its 2018 for gods sake)
-Removing DirectX 9 and putting in the most recent into the game to stop lag.
-More staff on Support or Quicker staff.
-Lowering the prices for the game overall.(People shouldnt pay that much for a game that looks like its out of 2009)

Iniziamo dai problemi e dalle pecche gravi del gioco iniziale:
- Il gioco con il nuovo gameplay a me personalmente non piace più di tanto, non amo avere skill selezionate e non avere pieno controllo della scelta.
- Il lancio è stato fra i peggiori visti, server piccoli che in pochi secondi erano pieni e sono dovuti andare a creare server nuovi, avrei preferito meno server ma più capienti.
- Molti problemi, al login rimane sempre bloccato alla schermata bless e per sbloccarlo bisogna riprovare anche 20 volte, ieri giorno 29 la lag dovuta a macchine poco efficenti per il numero di utenza ha portato a rendere ingiocabile il tutto e così non ci siamo proprio.
- Assenza del rank pvp 
- Assenza delle arene e campi di battaglia

Passiamo ai lati positivi:
- Il gioco è tradotto piuttosto bene
- Una volta sistemati i server diventa una buona alternativa ai tanti mmorpg visti in giro
- Le arene e i campi di battaglia arriveranno a breve quindi finalmente dopo il farm si avrà qualcosa da fare 

Dove si può migliorare?
- Aggiungendo nuove classi, e nuovi dungeon il gioco inizierà ad evolversi, quindi serviranno anche nuovi livelli per non appiattire il tutto.
- Ovviamente potenziando la macchina di gioco per evitare lag e i 10 server, magari fondendo gli ultimi server nati per avere più competizione e più pg in giro.
- Permettere di scegliere singolarmente le skill che si vogliono nella barra e non le prestabilite che rendono il tutto limitante.
- Permettere di modificare le combo R T Y che sono scomode, quindi permettere di scegliere che tasti settare per le combo sarebbe un gran bel passo in avanti. 
- Aggiungere anche delle clan hall non sarebbe male 

Le basi ci sono, ma bisogna evolvere il tutto e ottimizzarlo solo così potrà definirsi un buon gioco mmorpg, ma fino ad oggi il prodotto è effettivamente sotto la media, ha deluso le aspettative di molti, ma nonostante ciò voglio dargli fiducia e lo consiglio, sperando che nel giro di pochi mesi si evolva eliminando i problemi e garantendo una buona giocabilità e tante espansioni repentine per garantire tante ore di gioco ai players!",True,1527693011,1527740902,True,0,2,0.501520,True

Juego que esta disponible en otras regiones desde al menos 2013, nos llega ahora a EU y NA en acceso anticipado,un juego que ya ha fracasado en 3 regiones y del cual han intentado reinventar su sistema de combate para la region de EU y NA sin llegar a convencer.
Rendimiento y optimización por los suelos( estamos hablando de un juego de 2013 que corre en Dx 9), lag, colas,problemas con el juego y el launcher. A estas alturas de la historia te podrias esperar un poco mas, al menos q viniera pulido despues de todos estos años de desarrollo en otras regiones.

That is not a realistic hope. The game does have some issues(stuck at loading screen), these issues have work arounds and are actively being looked into, there is some performance issues some people claim to have. I did not expierence them. But for people that are, you can tweak config file to improve them. This has almost become standard with alot of MMO releases. 

I have found a few spots in the game where the translation was not carried over correctly. These can make trying to understand the quest hard, but its also a port from another lanquage and that can cause alot of issues and somethings dont always translate over correctly. 

But, Even with those issues the game is still really gorgious world around you. The gameplay so far I have really enjoyed. and the storyline even with its issues still does intice me to listen. The Pvp is fun, the dungeons are fun as well. And the questing I enjoyed(which I normally hate with a passion), So For 30$ its worth the money.. Its been awhile since a game has caught my attention for more than a day or so. I have played Wow-13yrs, AOC-1yr,EQ1 & Eq2- 3+yrs, ESO 2months, BDO 2 days.

I have two max level characters, both Rangers, one on Chinuwa, and one on Tanara (main). My previous review was more complaining about the complaints made towards the game; however, now I feel like I know the game well enough to really give an informed opinion about it.

If you don't wish to continue reading about my experience I'll just say that I absolutely recommend the game, even in it's current state. It is easily one of the best MMOs and RPGs I have played in recent years in all regards. If you do wish to continue reading about my experience, then keep reading.

So I guess I'll start with the reason why I wanted to rewrite this review. The reason I wanted to rewrite this review is because of what happened recently that really sold the game for me, and that is the developers. For some context, about a week ago from today (June 5, 2018) the developers released a path that nerfed the damage of all classes and buffed their health values. This was to accommodate PvP, as Rangers were very powerful and not many other classes could keep up, and it was also to make it so you couldn't just one-shot all PvE mobs. It was a challenge patch; it made the game more challenging. However, Rangers, my choice  class, were supposedly nerfed ""into the ground."" It was the same day that the patch was released that I rerolled Ranger on Tanara, so I have experienced the full force of the patch through every level up to max, 45. While I found the patch overall pretty good, many did not like it because it meant they had to relearn their class. At the same time, this only made Mages stronger because they could use their ice ability on a 0 second cooldown that would deal massive damage to anyone, so for that week Mages ruled the meta. The reason I love the developers is that they were quick to realize the struggle that the players were having, so they told the community that they would be changing the mob health, but that's not all they did. They also nerfed that 0 second cooldown into a 7 second cooldown. At the same time, they buffed Rangers pretty adequately to the point where now PvE isn't nearly as hard and Mages can't just instantly kill them anymore. Ultimately, this is why I wanted to rewrite this review as now I have concrete evidence to support my claim that ""the developers are devoted to this game."" And I stand by that statement. The developers actually care and want to maintain this game, as shown by the quick, but realistic changes they have implemented. I am amazed at their ability to make changes that fit within the game without breaking it so quickly. It was only a week before Rangers were back to their former glory.

I know it may seem biased because I play a Ranger, but consider the fact that the changes didn't make Rangers OP, instead they just changed the classes and values of mobs' health to make it so Ranger is even with all other classes.

Along with that, my experience has been amazing in this game. Like Skyrim, there are so many side quests you can do that characterize characters, areas, towns, and even antagonists. You learn so much about the game if you take 30 minutes to do a chain sidequest. In addition to this, the side quests are changed so you do them along with the story quest. They are convenient, so you don't have to go out of your way. I love this.

Then there is PvP. Around level 30, you start to get to a zone that both sides have story quests in, and they want to level up just as you do. This creates natural conflict in these zones, and promotes a kind of world PvP that I haven't seen since Vanilla WoW. This continues all throughout the rest of the levels. You never stop facing the enemy. While some may dislike this, they can use a pigeon that gives them a buff that unflags them for 10 minutes, so if you are doing something important, you can do it without being ganked, and if you want to gank others, you can do so with those who also want to PvP. Of course, this would be flawed if you could use the pigeons at max level, but you can't. You have to buy special pigeons to unflag yourself at max level, making pvp even more fun. This is exactly how PvP should be implemented into a game. Amazing.

Lastly, the community is a perfect balance of shithead to nice person. These nice people just happen to be trained in the way of the shithead too, so they can counter pretty well. Don't ever expect to be bullied even in chat. I love this because depending on my mood, I can choose to be either. It just makes the game that much more fun for me.

Overall, the game is amazing with a decent storyline, sidequests that aren't tedious, PvP on a level that parallels Vanilla WoW, but also implements its own features to make it even more fun and unique. I would rate the game a solid 8/10. When you first launch, you need to change the ini files, which is a big issue. Otherwise, the gameplay is super fun and unique, reminiscent of the really good old days in WoW.",True,1527692962,1528215024,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Dann sich über die Sequenzen und Untertitel aufregen finde ich auch unnötig. Die werden das mit der Zeit so oder so hin bekommen und etwas english kannst du ja bitte auch wenn du die RU oder Japan Version gezockt hast (hast du ja auch). Witzig finde ich dass du, obwohl du gesagt hast never play on patch/release day, dich über den Headstart (Lags, Server neustart, patches usw...) aufregst. Kommen wir zum letzten Punkt. Nähmlich P2W....
P2W hat für jede Person die ich jemals getroffen habe immer eine andere Bedeutung... Manche sagen, dass  zum Beispiel ein XP Booster P2W ist (obwohl es dir keine Vorteile gegenüber andere gitb, ausser dass man halt schneller max level ist was einem nix bringt da jeder mal max level wird...) und andere behaupten das gegenteil. 

Meiner Meinung nach hat Bless Online noch nicht verkackt und ich finde das Spiel auch spielbar. Mir macht es persönlich spass zu spielen und die Server werden stabiler. Genauso haben die Devs sich ziele gesetzt mit neuem Conten, Klassen, Patches usw.
Deshalb gehe ich stark davon aus, dass das Spiel sich gut entwickeln wird in den nächsten paar Monaten (wissen kann ichs ja nicht).",True,1527692406,1527692406,True,0,0,0.000000,True

I now know why Neowiz did that. This game is soo poorly desgined and optimized that even with a Nvidia Geforce 1080 graphics card your fps will be way below 60 and be more fucking 20 on the big servers. Neowiz you have disappointed me greatly. In the begining i thought ""oh look a small publsiher willing to not give their souls to abig corportation in exchange for more funds to make the game non pay to win? count me In!"" and so far they have kept their promise of being non pay to win the cash shop is not really advantageous for those who have money. however there are a shit ton of other issues tocontend with which I will get to. This game was laucnhed  3 times for those eof you who didn't know this game offically came out in 2011 released in 3 different coutnries Korea, Russia and Eu. it failed. so what did they do they worked 7 years and planned to make it the best it oculd be for NA and promised all these wonderful new ideas and didn't deliver.  they promised alot on the day of  EA access but buying EA was the worst choice you coudl make. Firs tof all your Ea doens;t amtte rbecaus eyou only get a 2 day head start, you couldn't preorder hte game ONLY FUCKING BUY IT at a certain time on May 28th when they woud release it but they fucked up putting the packs at the right time and released them 2 FUCKING HOURS EARLIER THAN THEY SAID THEY WOULD HAVE. but thats not all oh no it gets worse Never in my fucking many years of playing MMorpgs on the they launch or work have i had to contend with such bs that Bless makes you put up with. for starters on launch? They only had one fucking server you heard me.. one fucking server. the idea was ot make a super megaserver where both factions Hieron and Union pvped and where fairly balanced out however they couldn't manage this and that server was a fucking nightmare and super laggy so they had to put up more servers. and then those servers began getting faction locked. so eventually you got forced into playing the faciton you did not want or couldn't play with your friends or guildies because they picked union or Hieron and you got stuck having to pickthe opposite faction  because the option to go union was no longer avalible because too many people had picked to be Union. this isn't the only problem, On the day the game released  1000's of people couldn't get into the game because of a huge issue with the game client that kept on bringing up a splash screen when laucnhed htat would launch the game but discoonect you immediatly from it as you got on or fucking freeze forcing you have to  close out of the game on your computer and restart.  your computer at this point it was uncertain whether or not you'd get in. and if you did get in like all mmorpgs ya had to wait ina huge ass que for the big servers. eventaully I said fuck it and went to one of the smaller ones and began to play the game. I GOT STUCK in the fucking tutorial for a hour because the game is so poorly fucking mistranslated that they couldn't tell you how to put skills on your action bar, they fucking misnamed skills my fucking stance that they wanted me to use to complete the tutorial was called anger stance when the tutorial called it fury. oh no it doersn't stop there! ONLY ONE FUCKING CLASS HAS ACTION COMBAT! you heard me. they promised that there would be a option for some of the other classes to be action combat based. yet on release THEY FUCKING ONly  HAD ONE ACTION COMBAT CLASS. and that was berserker. but i got over that i was going to main berserker anyways. However there is also no endgam at all currently. on release day they promised 3v3's! End game dungeons Open world pvp But almost none of that was there but the open world pvp.  the game lags like shit and if you get disconnected Which you will If your're on the big ass server have fun you get ot wait in que along with the 1800 other people to play  your fucking chsracter. 

TLDR? DOOO NOOT BUY THIS PIECE OF SHIT! this game is a scam. neowiz trie dot lie to their customers and tell them you could not refund the game that once the payment was done your money was gone and all ya wer eleft with was this piece of fucking garbage.  Well guess what You are allowed to refund this game if you have not played more then 20 hours. it was so bad that steam had to give refunds back to appease their customers and neowiz is now going to lose all their money that they put into trying to devleopt his peace of shit cash grab. if you must buy it? get the fucking 30 dollar one do not  fucking collectors edition for 150$ or the 70$ edition  its not worth it this game doesn't earn that money. nor deserve it.  I guess this is a warning to anyone in the future about the problems of EA the BS scam that people can make and try to get away with it.

So far I am enjoying the game even though I looked past it once I realized back in 2016 it was marketed as tab-target, however that has changed in the years it's been released in other regions with the ""Action Combat"" camera choice that is currently only available to Berserkers (but will be available to all classes Soon™).

The gameplay is something to get use to like with any other newly ported NA/EU release from overseas, but I'm enjoying myself and learning how to play various classes, Berserker, Ranger, and Mage so far, and hope to play Mystic, Assassin, and Warlock once those are released! The combo system is automated so you have a starter skill then the option to combo skill on top of that (these skills aren't available unless you use a certain starter skill) which are keybind by default to R,T,Y. You continue the combo twice using the same intial key (ex. 1 > R > R or 2 > T > T or 3 > Y > Y), some skills with have a bouncing down arrow on them to indiciate that they can be charged and the charge available for these attacks are shown as bubbles above the skill icon - so far I've seen a max of two complete charges that can be performed on a skill.

The map looks pretty cool but difficult to navigate when you're trying to follow a quest that's directing you to a new city. There are three ways of travel that I've discovered so far: Wyvern (air), Gondola (waterway), and Airship (air), each cost a fee that can be decreased with the games Premium Subscription at which it is decreased by 50% (only Wyvern fees are decreased by Premium).

So far with the game I have not claimed my 30 days Premium as I do not feel hindered without it, mainly I feel this way because of the games I've listed above have had similar payment models (some even starting as P2P and turning into F2P w/Subscription option) and I've opted out of purchasing the Subscriptions offered (if offered) as it had no impact on my personal gameplay and being current with PvP (while not exactly being in the top tier) was not difficult to obtain or maintain during my days within those games. Was it difficult? Not really but it would've been easier and more profitable if I had them but that is personal perspective as well as whether or not you consider yourself a hardcore player in the top 1% and feeling a need to acquire an advantages available to you.

Surely I do not have enough hours in that game to judge fairly, but this is the so-far-judgement:

Avoid for now. Bad start, nothing new, been there done that. Only the combat is a bit refreshing. I had zero expectations and still got dissapointed.
And most of all: The performance is beyond horrible. A handful mobs, two other player and I'm down on 40fps on MINIMUM (My rig isn't the best of 2018, but still far from a potato).

[strike]I will update the review when I see more...[/strike] No I won't, I refunded, those constantly low FPS gave me headaches. And yes, I tested all those ""FPS fixes"". It made it partially better (higher fps-spikes) while also partially worse (more lag/delay (not talking of ping)).
I should've known better not to touch those weebo-MMOs, especially not one that already failed once (being horribly optimized as one reason). Final Fantasy did a much better job.
But well, at least I didn't get the Collectors Edition.


[u]The good (what to love):[/u]
[list]
[*] Graphics are basically neat. In theory. On max settings. Which you probably will never see :-)
[*] The combat is pretty nice, not mindless tabbing, but no real action either.
[*] Hans Zimmer worked on the Soundtrack! (although the music while creating your character became annoying after 5 minutes)
[*] Fighting gives you sometimes some really nice feedback, unusual for MMOs. Melee feels pretty punchy.
[*] The taming is cool, tame everything you see and enslave it as your pet or mount!
[*] Character-creation is a lil bit above average. Sadly more irrelevant iris-patterns than relevant haircuts or beards even.
[*] Steam-integration, no additional account needed.
[*] Auto-navigation to your waypoint/quest-target. If it would now allow auto-play too, I could do something else instead of enduring the lag-show ,-)
[/list]


[u]The mediocre (neither good nor bad, or simply not objectively either):[/u]
[list]
[*] The most uncreative races ever. Humans, Humans with longer ears, Humans with other ears, Cat-human, Dog-humans, tiny humans. Been there, done that, a million times. Boooring :)
[*] Fixed UI, nothing configurable. Nothing.
[*] I've been told that everything's English anyway, no matter what language you choose. Shall be fixed on release though. They said...
[/list]



[u]The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):[/u]
[list]
[*] Classes are race-locked (doh!) and races are (except the tiny one) side-locked (for RvR). Super dumb unless you deeply care for the lore (but who the hell does in such a run of the mill asia grinder?).
[*] Horrible (head-)start. Login-problems, full servers, crashes, maintenance every other hour (Would be acceptable, but they already had a launch and failed the same)
[*] Incredibly bad FPS. Nice at first, then went downhill nearing the first city to a solid 5fps on max graphics up to 20fps with minimum. Yes that may be due to the massive amount of people in that area. But considering ""big scale RvR"" is the endgame, I'm already convinced that this will be bad unless you're a consolero and totally used to and fine with 30fps max. 
[*] Sometimes you can't even start the game and get stuck at the logo. Forever. Game's still responding though, but it idles. No comment, no notice, no nothing. ALT-F4 blocked :) Sometimes you'll have to try and start it 10 times :(
[*] Item-Shop. Same model like Elder Scrolls Online (just that you don't receive some currency monthly ""for free"" when subscribing). Died? No problem, either walk a while to your corpse, or pay some euros to resurrect right here. Comfy he?
[*] Abysmal ""Tutorial"". Literally one minute into the game and you have no clue what to do because the tutorial tells you to use skills you don't even have. It eludes me how you can manage to NOT test ONE character 2 minutes before a release.  But luckily the store works so you can spend $$$
[*] [strike]Crafting? Use a pick-axe for ONE node. Like in real life. Hack one time with your pick-axe and it's gone. Unless you BUY one in the shop, those last for an hour. Like the good brand from the DIY-store ,-)[/strike] (See comments)
[*] The chat-censoring (which you can't turn off) is a joke. Ask ""WHO?"" and it will be ""W**?"". They apply english word filters on words of any language with funny results. Every sentence you got the feeling you've been insulted coz it's all *****ed out.
[*] It's even censored content-wise to get a T-Rating to be able to reach the teen-market too. And boy, the chat does show. It's the worst public chat I've ever seen, and I've been around quite some time.
[*] Horrific voicing. Did they record the mostly heartless actors with a phone from 2008?

The good, the interface is smooth and the combat system is enjoyable with a multi-button mouse. This allows you full access to the combat skills without having to use a 32 button mouse. The capture systems for pets and mounts is vast and not just a reskin of the same creatures. Content is planned out on a regular basis. PvE and PvP. Gear is not a burden but does feel natural. 

The bad, there are changes from the other versions of course. The crafting system is ""kunky"" but usable. Resources and capture scrolls are a joke (please put the level 1-15 back to the merchants). No housing system. No ships/water system (Airship battles would help this out a lot, hint hint). There is a learning curve and try not to learn everything on day 1 as it is very confusing until you get the hang of the basics.

The ugly, Company did not plan for scalibility and is now running in circle trying to meet expectations. This is breaking up guilds, friends, families, and MUST be addressed right away.

Das Spiel ist mittlerweile fast 10 Jahre alt und ist schon zum 4ten mal Releast worden. Und in allen fällen ist es leider untergegangen. Ich habe mir anfangs das Standart-Gründerpacket gekauft und konnte es die hälfte der versprochenen zeit nicht spielen. Dazu kommt noch das die server (EU) ziemlich am laggen waren ( grund könnte aber auch der Sturm in Deutschland zu dem Punkt sein ) und die Entwickler die ausrede ""Early Access"" verwenden. Für 10 Jahre ist ""Early Access"" ziehmlich hinfällich. Die Performance ist unter aller sau. Mit meinem PC (( GTX 1080ti, 16gb RAM und einem intel core i7 7te generation hatte ich maximum 40 fps, was viel im gegensatz zu anderen war. Dazu haben sich die Nutzer auf Reddit eine einfache Methode gemacht mit dem mann bis zu 40 fps sparen kann. Ganz recht - DIE NUTZER, nicht der Entwickler. Zudem kommen noch eine nicht ganz richtige Englische übersetzung und Kampfsystem bei dem ich einfach nicht warm werde.

so far this game compared to Archeage is just better. 
combat is wonky but it was reworked. they can always change it. having 6 inputs instead of like 20 gives me less of a headache.
no P2W AT ALL. can even CONVERT INGAME CURRENCY TO LUMINA..... take that p2w AA! ((dont even get me started on apex prices...))
party system is really neat you can set 2 buffs depending on party size and what races/classes are in it ((just by being a mascu i give anyone im in party with (including myself) a % increase in crafting progress, up to 50% if in a party of all 4 races))

game still lags for me a bit. but still better than early access for AA... ""gods have disconected you"" every day for weeks at random. doing the .ini fixes made it a LOT smoother but didnt fix my fps... might be a driver issue on my end idk.

they started with 1 server. as of this review just before the launch there are 6 servers full of players, AND NO ALT ARMIES

Now about the game itself:
1/ Poorly Optimization: The game was lag and had massive FPS drop
2/ 2 days head start: So far after 8 hours: 3 maintenance
""Start time: 13:00 PDT/22:00 CEST. The expected duration of maintenance is about 1 hour; 
IMPORTANT UPDATE: We will be conducting another emergency maintenance.
IMPORTANT UPDATE: We will be conducting a server check maintenance. Start time: 01:00 PDT / 10:00 CEST.""
Source: From Bless Online official Discord - announcements
3/ Bad game mechanics: You have to do quest untill lv 13 so you can enjoy open world, My friend played Paladin grinded instead of questing, when he fought the lv 6 dungeon all his gears were broken. In order to repair gears, you have to be level 13. Long story short, he got his refund.
4/ Bad translation.

My opinion: Bless Online is a game released in 2011 and using Unreal Engine 3. It is 2018 and there are so many games with better graphic and even better gameplay, so far i haven't found any information about Bless wants to remake the graphic.
If you watch the Press Conference about Bless Online holding in May 11, you would notice these things:
1/ The location was bad
2/ Problem occured in the presentation
3/ Problem occured when Emissaries tried the game + they only gave them 20 minutes to try the game
4/ There was almost no gameplay or anything revealed to us before the Press Conference and even you watched the Emissaries played, you still haven't get much information from them.

All i say here Bless online is very very fishy - The lack of organization, the laziness about the game's translation, the rumours about the community manager in Bless Online's Discord, the overprice founder's package, the un preparation for the lunching. All of those things give me a feeling that Bless Online is full of debt right now and all they want to do is selling the game as fast as they can and run away.

I know this sounds crazy but I have been gaming for over a decade and have been through much worse. The take away from the launch is that though there were problems, the Devs made sound descions in a timely manner and executed their hot fixes expertly and under the planned maintenance timeframe. They have truly earned my trust and respect for the exemplary job they did.

The game itself is actually fun! I think so many were completely caught up in the mob mentality that they didn't even play the game long enough to see the beauty of their creation. The game is quite attractive and I am blown away by the diversity of creatures I have found so far in the game. The charater creation is fabulous and I have made a toon that I absolutely love.

This isn't your typical easy peasy tab target game however. It actually has a bit of a learning curve and you must learn how to upgrade your skills and use your combos intelligently. I think the lack of hand holding has some players shying away in fear but rest assured, the game is deep and the customization is pretty cool. If this bothers you, just wait for some good guides to come out so you can do the cookie cutter meta builds that we have all grown accustomed to in other popular mmo's <cough ESO>.

Speaking of ESO, I paid way more for that game back in it's beginning and people thought it was a wreched unplayable train wreck at launch too. Now it is a completely different story. For a measly $30 you can play something both entertaining and challenging with open world PVP. Despite some negative reviews there are still a ton of us still enjoying this game for a reason.

Neowiz has given us a solid choice in the sea of cookie cutter mmo's and now it is our turn to dive in, roll up our sleaves and build an amazing community to really make Bless an amazing experience for those bored with the status quo.",True,1527690024,1527690024,True,0,1,0.000000,True

the game is good hands down, if you like mmos at least give it a shot. it feels like a hybrid of BDO, GW2 and WoW.

there have been a lot of maintenances during early access, which have not stopped dedicated players from getting to max level and enjoying the content. 

let it be known that the publisher most likely had no idea that they would receive as many players as they have. (as they started with 1 server per region, and we are now at 6, with 2 more per region being added upon the release this afternoon) 

the open world pvp is highly enjoyable and is a welcome change of pace in 30+ questing/grinding areas. 

there are a number of fixes that make the game run immensely better. if you successfully apply them and the game still runs choppy then i have a bad new for you, you need a better computer.

+ movement is nice, havent encountered weird things
+ combat is good, doesnt require you to stand still to use skills
+ nice missions system its not confjusing or anything just plain simple, You dont run a lot or travel a huge amount of times for quests, nice hunt (killquests) so the game has lot of things u can do.
+ Market system for ingame equipment
+ Able to keybind the way you want things
+ Nice character customization

0,129,7,5270,5270,76561197964068957,0,english,False,42384075,"So the game is far from perfect and the early release launch is plagued with woes of long queues and getting locked out of servers or the faction of choice, but in all fairness if you did not expect as much then you are a fool for being so optimistic. This is an early release or as far as I'm concerned it's a beta release and so we are all part of the pre retail release testing the stability, bugs and possible exploits; refining the game if you will. If you want a finished  and polished game then don't buy into a game which states early access, it's your own damn fault cause you bought into beta testing. Now that much out of the way, I'm not sure why they got rid of action combat and went for a tab target combat, it is a clunkier system and can be annoying when you need to swap enemies on the fly, even still it's manageable, specially with area effect attacks and crowd control. The game is not unplayable, but it is buggy and getting stuck on the starting splash screen is a pain, which requires closing the game and restarting, sometimes multiple times, which I know for many is a world ending event, but honestly it's not that big of a deal when you think of the shit we have to put up with on a day to day basis, just suck it up and keep in mind this is early access, the beta phase, the time where they work on all the bugs and flaws in the release.

Sure the game has been released in other regions but they also pulled back on this release to rework the game for the North American and Europian audiences and for anyone who does coding, they should understand that sometimes changes thought to be minimal or unrelated to other aspects of the coding can cause odd things to happen in unexpected places and this is probably what is happening, I don't know what because I'm no programmer, but I do know cause and effect is a thing and whatever can happen will happen, positive, negative or otherwise. I personally think that a lot of the negativity towards this game is being blown out of proportion and likely in many cases just ""kids"" getting angry cause they feel entitled to everything working exactly as they anticipate, even during an early release; so really expectations are too high and tolerence and patience are far too low, but this is to be expected from a community which really on a whole is extremely privilaged.

So onto the game itself.

From what I've played the game plays fairly smoothly, albeit playing guardian I kind of feel like a borderline god and as such I plan to try out a few other classes, although as a rule I prefer tanks and healers, meaning my next character will be a paladin. The story elements in the game are not that interesting to me, nor are the quests, but then again I play single player games for story lines and I play MMORPGs to mess around with friends, have a few laughs and overall goof off, stories are not the focus of my multiplayer experience and I feel a lot of times too much emphasis is put into what I call the fluff of the game. As for leveling it is a decent pace, although at level 13 on it feels more like a dungeon grind and with there being only one dungeon available per side it gets monotonous. I do not know much about dungeons and leveling beyond level 21 at this point. Now as for combat, as I stated earlier, I'm not so sure why they went back to tab targetting, but that's what it is, so swapping enemies is annoying cause it's not based on facing, it's a lock on, but this is as I also stated before, manageable so not a big deal, just a little adjustment; the combo system is really interesting and I do like how it is managed, quite simple yet effective. The skill upgrade system is nice and seems to be a fair amount to unlock within a given class, which is nice also; sadly it's not as freeform customizable as I'd like, but a customizable archetype is still nice and allows for that personal touch to a character and also may or may not please those min maxers out there. 

So character creation is decent, not as  customizable as Black Desert, more around the same level as Guild Wars 2, perhaps a little more or less; the races are certainly not as exotic as Guild Wars 2 but are extremely more diverse than Black Desert or rather Humans with a sprinkle of elves and a token giant to say there is race diversity in the player characters. I have only played the Pantera race and not cause they are furry but because I love that the race shares a name with an iconic metal band from the 80s and 90s which I listened to a lot of in my teen years so of course I paid an homage to that band and even named my character Daryl, I thought anout Dimebag Daryl or Diamond Daryl, but no spaces or underscores allowed in name generation and I thought for sure Dimebag and Diamond would already be taken, I wasn't even sure I'd get Daryl to be honest.Back to the creation topic; the nice thing about character creation in this game, which actually is superior to Black Desert, is that you can modify the direct head size of the character, which means characters don't have to be bean poles to look proportional like in Black Desert, for me this is a huge plus since I hate shrunken head syndrome. Now as I think about this, the character creation in this game might actually be superior to Black Desert and Guild Wars in some or many respects, but also has it's limitations and some of the sliders you won't see unless you select the bottom option for all sliders, it's a little pictogram to the right of the character preview with three sliders on it and that has all the slider options.

In conclusion I'd say the game is worth the money, but only if you are willing to see passed the early access (Beta test phase) issues and work through the inconveniences, otherwise wait a few months while they polish things a bit more and get some of the more agitating bugs dealt with.

1. The biggest problem so far is they locked out servers so new players can't create characters, this means my entire guild are split between different servers, this is unacceptable.

2. The translation is terrible, a lot of the text doesn't make any sense and is hard to read.

3. After level 30 the game becomes a huge grind and apparently after level 45(max level) there is no content because the devs have taken it all out for no reason at all.

4. There is a duplication bug which has already ruined the economy before the game has officially launched.

5. You have to pay real money to be able to teleport to your party.

Wenn man ein (sehr) gutes System hat, läuft es gut.
Innerhalb der Städte stottert es natürlich derzeit imens.

[b]Gameplay [4/5][/b]
Ich finde es gut, sehr interessant mit den ganzen Möglichen Combos zu arbeiten und sich seine Set's zusammenzustellen.
Aber es ist am Anfang extremst nervig ist sich in das System rein zu denken und alles richtig zu verstehen.
Auch die Wechselwirkungen finde ich immernoch leicht verwirrend.

Diese sind die [i]meiner Meinung[/i] nach derzeit wichtigsten Punkte bei Bless.
Es ist nicht leicht zu einem Spiel viel zu sagen bei dem es doch recht schwer ist es zu spielen. Nicht wegen des Schwierigkeitsgrades. Sondern wegen der derzeit doch recht heftigen Fehler.
Man kann es definitiv Spielen. Man braucht allerdings einiges an Zeit und Motivation.

Es ist ein Early Access Spiel, ich erwarte nichts anderes als viele Fehler. Aber genauso erwarte oder erhoffe ich mir, dass alle diese Fehler, Bugs und Probleme die es derzeit gibt mit der Zeit verschwinden werden. Ich kenne kein Fehler freies Spiel, daher soll sich die ""Community"" mal etwas beruhigen.
Ich finde [b]Bless Online[/b] von dem was ich bisher gesehen habe gut. Ich werde es auch weiterhin Spielen und kann all den Leuten welche sich überlegen Bless zu kaufen nur sagen, ich finde es gut. Ich werde den Prozess der weiteren Entwicklung beobachten und mitgestalten.

Yes the launch had FPS / load screen issues and long Ques but I don't think any MMO has ever had a smooth launch and always takes a week or 2 to stabilise. I definitely recommend playing it yourself for your own opinion.

and I will update this as the game progresses and as I don't lose interest.

People who claim this is pay to win and there have been quite a few streamers and kids alike. The premium membership gives funtion and time saving. Most of the items on the special shop are cosmetic and can still be purchased from playing in game. Like dungeon point farming that can later be converted to Lumena to purchase these cosmetics at no cost of real life currencies.

The combat system is much better than a lot of current MMO's Mage and Ranger are traditional tab targetting and Berserker is not. Your abilities chain to different attacks so there is no need to have 30+ action bars all used up for different abilities. The in-game tutorials are pretty poorly translated but the abilities tab is really not that confusing to figure out. The quest tracking took me quite abit of time to get used to as it can be overwhelming with tons of quests and such in the starting areas. But after awhile I started to progress further and further and the amount of quests in the open world are not as abundant as the starting zone so you don't need to do every quest either.

This is early access and as such you need to go into it with an open mind as a lot of whats annoying now probably and most likely won't be as annoying when it comes out of early access. Launch was a bit of a pain in the butt, but its not the worst I have experienced. 

I will update this when I reach the current end game content, As so far I have leveled up to 30 on 2 characters ;)

So Update to this review in its current state the game is not worth 40$-150$ this should be a maximum of 20$ with the promise of adding more replayable content or some battlegrounds pvp of some sort. Its early access but not worth the max prices listed. The game has potential and I will definately be back if it goes free to play when they release new content for it.

- No Arenas or battlegrounds.

-No PVP Ranking system or ranking rewards.

-Honor point acquisition is broken.

-Basel canyon (main pvp map) is empty, no mobs.

-SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, can't progress past 45.

-Skill Gem acquisition is broken

-No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)

Le gameplay est ultra mou, on presse une touche (1,2 ou 3) et ensuite vous allez bêtement appuyer sur E, R ou T par deux fois.

Es ist unumstreitbar das dass spiel zum aktuellen Stand massive Probleme hat. Server disconnects, lags, maintaince und downtime und das es die Deutschen Untertitel nicht gibt (ändert sich vill heute um 19uhr beim eigentlichen Release)

Es wird nicht ohne Grund als early Access aufgeführt weil die westliche Version überarbeitet ist und wir die Leute sind die es testen und den Entwicklern Feedback geben müssen.

Was nicht hilfreich ist sind reviews von Leuten die diese beginnen mit den Worten „Ich spiele seit 15jahren Mmos und...“
Dabei haben diese grad 1-5 Stunden in dem Spiel verbracht und beschweren sich über die Server und Co.

Ich denke viele haben ihre Erwartungen viel zu hoch geschraubt daraufhin die FounderPacks gekauft und konnten auf Grund von Server Problemen nicht spielen.
Keiner hat die Leute zum Kauf vom Founder pack gezwungen und die Redewendung „Never Play on Release Day“ gibt es nicht ohne Grund.

Wer Bless in einen aktzeptablen Zustand spielen will wartet 2-3 Wochen, wer aber durchstarten will und vorne mitspielen möchte der muss nunmal da durch.

Bless wird alle 3 Monate neuen content bringen und das Spiel beginnt nunmal erst richtig im endlevel.

It will not be optimized like people hope.. It never was before. 
Very basic UI, Very basic setting options. Its really nice graphics for Dx9 but then again their other problem.. Early 2000s engine etc. For me the camera kills it, I was hoping the combat update would make that aspect workout better, but this can not been seen now as they pulled that out. The camera is very jarring, always moving on its own, zooming in it drops to below foot lvl before framing character again etc. Even basic things like camera settings would have made huge diff I think..? Im not even talking about the cam zooming in and out auto when sprinting, however because of all I said about it above it does make it worse, and again no setting to stop that either.
My other gripe is for a game that is B2P WITH a Sub (even if optional),you have to buy unlocks from the CS..Like more Bag space. Around only 12x(?) can be gathered in game. That's just stepping backwards. And like BDO these things are not account bound, even the more expensive items.
I do not want it to fail.. But they just repeated the same mistake AGAIN.. This is not some, they will get it done it just came out.

Der Publisher hat eine Kompensation in Form von Lumena geleistet. 
Das behebt sicher nicht das Hauprproblem, dass ich nun auf einem anderen Server als dert Großteil meiner  Gilde bin, aber es ist ein Anfang, und ich gehe von einer späteren Möglichkeit des Serverwechsels aus. 
Hier hat sich wider Erwarten gezeigt, dass Neowhiz tatsächlich versucht, hier ein anständiges Spiel mit anständihem Service hinzulegen.

Auch die FPs-Probnleme sind mehr oder weniger gelöst.. aber wie immer war die Community da schneller, als der Publisher. :)
Youtube und reddit geben gute Anleitungen, ein wenig in sen .ini-Files des Games zu modifizieren, um erhebliche Verbesserungen zu erzielen. 
Gut, man sollte das auch von einem Publisher erwarten... aber gut.. mit ehal, woher der Fix kommt, Hauptsache, es funzt! ;)

Die Story ist bisher sicher nicht neu, aber dafür interessant, und das Spielen an sich macht jetzt tatscählich Spass. Sicher gibt es noch Luft nach oben.. aber zumindest kann ich meine Beurteilung jetzt zu empfehlenswert ändern. 

Ursprüngliches Feedback folgt weiter unten. :)

- Headstart verdient den Namen nicht. Server down, Maintenances, bei Änderung der Bildschirmeinstellung Neuinstallation (inkl. neuem stundenlangen Download), weil alles abstürzt. Etliche Start-Versuche, bis der Launcher tatsächlich mal ne Verbindung herstellt. 
Headstart effektive Spielzeit bis jetzt: etwa 20 Minuten. Refund trotzdem gleich nicht mehr möglich, weil 2 Stunden Spielzeit aufbegraucht. (Der zählt tatsächlich mit, wenn das Spiel angeblich läuft, aber weder in Taskleiste noch im Taskmanager zu finden ist... ^^)
Ich habe mich verdammt auf das Spiel gefreut.. aber hier fühle ich mich (Headstart) echt veräppelt. Wofür genau habe ich jetzt das Pack gekauft? Um mir das SPiel auf Steam anzugucken, weil ich selber nicht spielen kann?

Erwähnte ich, dass man derzeit NICHT die Server und Fraktion frei wählen kann, um zum Beispiel seiner Gilde beizutreten, die bereits vor einem angefangen hat, weil die jeweiligen Server ""too crowded"" sind?
Sowas mag bei einem Launch passieren.. aber doch nun wirklich nicht bei einem Headstart, wo die Spielerzahl deutlich geringer ist....

SO ist zumeindest die ganze Founder-Geschichte NICHT zu empfehlen. ^^

Sollte sich was ändern und vor allem ein schneller, kostenloser, problemfreier Servertransfer angeboten werden, wird das natürlich geändert.. denn das Spiel AN SICH ist sicher nicht so verkehrt. Aber wie gesagt: Founder´s Packs waren wirklich rausgeschmissenes Geld…. 30 Euro in den Sand geschissen. ^^",True,1527686842,1527757939,True,0,0,0.000000,True

It's been a good two days and nothing notable has been done by the Bless team to fix the plethora of issues the game faces. I cannot recommend this to anyone until the Devs fix a huge majority of their issues. They've got a really huge wall in front of them to overcome if they are to hope to succeed.


After giving the Bless team some time (since EA launch 2 days ago) to iron out their issues, nothing notable has been done to address the plethora of issues that it is facing.

The issue that everyone faces is the incredibly poor PERFORMANCE - both server side and client side. In addition to that, frequent maintenance & server crashes worsen the experience (but of course, this is to be expected for any MMO launch). FPS wise without the player-made tweaks, I got below 30 FPS in towns and a frequent below 40 FPS outside of towns (my rig runs GTX1080, 16 GB RAM, i7-6700). On a side-note, there have been guides written by PLAYERS (not developers) to help alleviate the FPS issues which work to some extent but still does not help the experience too much (and rightfully, it should be the devs who published the guide or patch to address this issue, not the players).

GAMEPLAY wise, it is not what one would expect for a price tag of 30/40 USD (and above) - the entire world is unpolished. Dialogue, quests and plot are poorly written and boring. Animations are blocky and unpolished. Sound effects are horrible (sounds like what I would get from an indie game) - voice acting is worse. 
I did a level 31 Dungeon that had a ""cooldown"" of a couple of minutes which makes absolutely no sense in an MMORPG that requires you to grind for levels and loot. Loot in dungeons with a party follows the traditional bid system and does not prioritize giving the item to the correct classes. Another gripe I have with the game is that if a player tags a field mob first, the mob's rewards are his and only his.
I grinded to mid-endgame thinking that the game would be more fun then, but it isn't - it's the same thing, except with field PVP (and people ganging up to get kills).

The COMBAT system has potential, but isn't quite there yet. I enjoyed being able to have options to chain my combos into - based on what I wanted and how I planned to attack. However, the two most blatant frustrations that I have (and other players too) are:
1. Missing an attack would completely reset the combo.
2. Using a non-stance ability would reset the combos. This is INCREDIBLY painfully frustrating for me. Coming from FF14 where we have off-GCD abilities, I cannot fathom as to why the developers would decide that using a non-stance ability should reset the combos. That makes it incredibly counter-intuitive to use any of your non-stance abilities - which means you either use them before you start combos or at the end of the combos only. So why would I want to blink mid-fight if I cannot for-the-love-of-GOD chain my high-damage combos or stuns? Why would I want to cast ""Counterspell"" when it completely disrupts my combo? If you have played League of Legends before, imagine you're Yasuo, you have 3 stacks of Gathering Storm (Q) and you're going to go in for the huge knockup play, but you have to Flash to get in range - but wait, Flashing completely removes your 3 stacks and you can't knockup anymore. NEOWIZ, WHY?
The combo resets make it seem as if the devs have not play-tested the combat enough, or even knowledgeable/talented enough to understand what constitutes a good and smooth combat flow.
Besides that, the game could do with an innate dodge ability besides the one non-stance ability you equip. Blinking should also not lock your movement (there's a short 0.5? second delay before you can move again) after usage.

The skill/talent tree (whatever it was called) was confusing and poorly designed. It had combat stats, exp stats, gold stats all mixed into the same tree. It is also a linear skill tree for each of the four paths which makes it incredibly boring. Leveling the skills / abilities / talents used some form of currency which I'm not sure how to obtain except from rewards through quests - not via leveling, which is really confusing (at least for me).

Crafting was.. meh. Few crafting options, and lots of the materials I did not know how to obtain so I did not even bother much with crafting. I crafted some baguettes and a necklace only and gave up on the rest.

Repairing / enhancing / taming - tedious and confusing.

Besides that, another unacceptable issue is that the Localization is incredibly poorly done - the worst I have seen for a game I have ever paid for. I cannot figure out most of my skills due to the poor translation. Also, a prime example of poor localization is that the mailbox ""receive"" button is translated to ""gift"" - yes, ""gift"" which is supposed to be the button you click to receive items from the mail. It's as if they simply threw their localization strings into google translate, plopped it into the game and never looked at it again.

Another opinion I have is that the outfit design is really bland and boring - even those on the cash shop. I did not find even 1 outfit to my liking.

I had thought they would be able to iron out all the issues by launch day (or planned & shared a roadmap or informative post to address the issues) but it seems I was mistaken. All they have ever done is just post on character creation restrictions, adding new servers, maintenances and a notice that they were aware of server issues. Then, they had the nerve to post about game balance (healing not as potent as damage) when the fundemental issues that actually allow for a smooth gaming experience weren't even addresed.


WHAT I LIKED:
1. Character creation - good. It's good and has lots of customization options. I only didn't like the voice options, otherwise it's pretty solid.
2. Combat - kinda. I had fun with the combat except for the few setbacks and frustrations I had mentioned above.


[b]TLDR;[/b]
[b]The BAD:[/b]
1. Bad performance - FPS (30 & below on a good rig) & Server lag.
2. Poor gameplay - lackluster quests / storyline / dungeons.
3. Bad audio - poor sound quality & bad voice acting.
4. Disappointing combat - combos being cancelled/reset by missed attacks & usage of any non-stance abilities.
5. HORRIBLE LOCALIZATION - the worst I have ever seen. Everything seems to be taken from Google translate.
6. No roadmap/plans from Devs on issue fixes.
7. (Opinion) Bland & boring outfits.
8. Other issues faced by other players such as friends not being able to get in the same server and them getting their items server & character bound.

[b]The GOOD:[/b]
1. Character creation has lots of customization options except I didn't like the voices.
2. Combat feels fun at first because of the many available combo-chain options but fails to impress later on due to the frustrating mechanics (see point 4 above).

Even the so called .ini fixes aren't always a solution to this severe problem. For a game that's been in development for over 7 years this is just not acceptable. And Directx9?? Really, in 2018? The engine just shows it age, it feels old and you pick that up very fast, especially with the graphics.

Besides the optimisation (which is the most glaring problem) there's also the localisation, which is in broken English and doesn't make sense most of the time. It was a challenge just to finish the introduction guide quest because of the broken translation. The fact that the first thing a player sees isn't even properly translated is a warning signal. 2level anyone...

The list sadly doesn't end there. The voice acting is stale and bad flowing. The dialogue animations are laughable (why even bother with them if you're not going to properly do them, just do a normal chat bubble). It has the typical korean MMO story that just drops you into it and lets you figure things out. Let's just say the writing wasn't that impressive.

And then there's the combat. It's stale and not very fun. Similar to Guild Wars 2 but lacking all the depth. It's just an auto tabtargeting combat system with a simplistic combo system. Pres 1 and Smash R over and over. The Lazy Peon really sums it up good here. I was expecting more of the combat system.

Also there's the heavy debated Pay to Win debacable. For me if a game has XP+Currency boosters for sale and premium repair kits + a premium membership that saves you gold then it's pay to win. If gold wasn't as important then why are they selling premium repair kits? Time will tell if it truly will be Pay to Win but still, why even bother introducing this? It shouldn't be needed, trust in your game and just sell cosmetics like some upcoming MMO is doing.. *cough* Ashes of Creation *cough*.

WOW? No?

Is it fun?

Well I've been having fun.

Good voice acting, a stroy that actually present and not just a jumble of random words.  A combat system thats different.  It is tab based but its not point in fire.  Every skill starts a chain, and those chains then break into other chains with various effects.  If you need to land a silence you dont click the ""silence skill"", you have to combo into that skill.  If you say its mindless point in click combat, you clearly havent played with the system.

Alright, lets start from the top.
You download the game, all fine. You start it up.. and you get stuck on the Bless Splash screen.. Restart and retry. Try up to 20 times before you get in. Alright.. not a great sign, lets continue.

Youre finally in the game, If you manage to actually get in on the server you want and the side you want good for you! If not, well shit, you gotta wait I guess! For how long you ask? To be announced is their answer.

Okay, so youre in on the server, the character creation is really good tbh. Nice.

Now youre in the game.. you notice your FPS being a bit low even tho you got a solid computer? Alright, might just be setteling in, lets give it a few.

You try the Tutorial and notice Major ""translation"" errors, for example on the Berserker, it tells you to gain some power and use the For Life and Death.

Now.. two things, Berserkers dont have Power, they got rage. And that skill they tell you to use? Its actually called Fight like Kilkenny Cats.
Just a slight translation error, alright. 

You eventually get past the tutorial and start to see other players, as soon as you do that you notice your FPS going down a damn lot more.. Like a fuck ton.

You turn everything to low to counteract it, dont work. You google around a bit and you actually find something that helps a little, but it forces you, the user, to go into the .INI files to edit stuff. Because you know, its 2018, why would companies actually try to help you with shit?

Anyway, You keep playing.. you eventually get to the first big town.. and ooooh boy. You can play PUBG with 100+ stable fps? Well this town has 15. Enjoy.

After that you do some quests, Combat is pretty fun, + on that one. Music is good, thats another +.

You keep playing untill you get to 13. Now this is where you start your dungeon spam to level, cause thats most efficient. You spam said dungeon untill level 22-23. Then go for another dungeon untill 32. Then  go for another dungeon.. 

And when you eventually reach Endgame which currently sits at level 45. You realize.. Fuck, there is NOTHING TO DO.
Why? Cause they removed EVERYTHING. 
This is what was in all other versions, but not ours for some reason.
-No Arenas or battlegrounds.
-No PVP Ranking system or ranking rewards.
-Honor point acquisition is broken.
-Basel canyon (main pvp map) is empty, no mobs.
-SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, can't progress past 45.
-Skill Gem acquisition is broken
-No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)
-Two ''end game'' dungeons with exactly same gear score drops
-No royal quest
-No honor quest
-No daily dungeon

Now.. you'll see a lot of people be like, but its early access.. but its this, its that. Fuck that. These things were in the other versions. Why the heck would they have to remove them for ours? To stagger content? Maybe.. But for them to be able to do that THERE HAS TO BE CONTENT TO BEGIN WITH, AND THERE IS NOT.

I wanted this game to succeed. I went in blind, having ignored reddit and friends. I wanted another MMO to take a good place in my life. But no, this is not it. This is not even close. Sorry Neowiz, You fucked up bigtime.

Oh btw, there is a Dupe bug in the game that has been in the game since the korean And japanese versions, its been reported. Its known. They did nothing about it. The market will be fucked, money is trivial, everything will be easy to get. GG.

Even tho the Combat is fun, it really is. And the Music Is good..

A game which is already in use for such a long period with so many bugs in coding is not acceptable. Not enougt there are so many downsides of this game I will just write it down for ppl who may wanna start this game.

Pros:
- old style MMORPG
- no pay2win
- fantasy medival genre

Cons:
   personaly game breaking no go!
- NO CONTENT at all! ( missing Battlegrounds, Dungeons, Arena´s etc)
- There is no real Rework or westernisation which is in any kind worth mentioning. There is no real feeling of getting a 
   polished game. And to call this an Early Access for a game which is released in 2012 is just a joke.

other Cons worth mentioning
- bugs
- bad coding
- severel log in tries to even get into game
- old graphics
- bad animations
- not even close contemporary.

A game which still suffers from bad coding since 2012 wont get any real solutions even in the next decades!

What's bad about it:

-Loading screen of death. When you launch the game, it tries to connect to the server. If it fails, Bless Online will NOT retry to connect. Thus, you get 'stuck' at the loading screen. You're then forced to quit the game entirely, reboot in and hope it connects. Good luck because it took me 26 reboots to finally connect.

-Optimization. I have a higher end gaming rig. I had to drop nearly everything to low settings to make this game run and not skip all over the place.

-Skill confusion. Seriously, the text box and description is a nightmare. So confusing to read and understand what each does. 

-Quests. Literally, you just click the shoe button and it will just run you to each place and then click through the cut scene and the quest is complete. It did not immerse me or get me in the mood to do things.

-Zone to Zone travel. You would think the quests would move you in a typical fashion from zone to zone. No. Instead, you accept the quest and then you have to go find the airship and then travel to the other side of the world to find where to go and quest. 

-Bugs. One quest tells you to get gathering tools, but if you have the founders pack, you already have that. The quest does not recognize it, thus you must buy the tools from the vendor to complete. Annoying. I also started randomly getting 25xp like every minute from somewhere. 

-Sounds. The sounds are very amateur. My character running sounded like two metal measuring cups banging across granite countertops.. seriously...

Graphics are decent and the animations are nice. The combat system seemed okay for the most part, although the Paladin seemed a bit clunky.

The servers are also garbage, everything lags even with the small amount of players across several servers on both regions (if you look at steam stats), sometimes you can't even get past the title screen, forcing you to restart the game and keep trying, only to land in a queue. Then once you're in-game, everything apart from combat (so for example looting, selling, quest taking) is delayed by 5 to 10 seconds because of the awful lag. Disgusting trash.

Open World Review:
Bless Online is a wide open world game. Think TERA and Black Desert Online combined. Sounds awesome right? Well to some extent yes, there's a lot to explore, or rather want to explore, but unlike BDO there's major limitations. That big castle, no you're not going to get to walk on it's walls via glitch or not. No, you're not going to get to go into that building and see every floor, unless it's part of a quest or some place you get to talk to someone in. So that 20,000 mile tall castle is just for decoration. If that's not bad enough for you explorer's like me, combat! We always run into enemies way too strong, right? And we RUN the hell away! Not in Bless Online, no you stand and fight because you have no evasion, dodge, roll, OR sprint ability, no recall stone to use or anything. It's either stand and fight, or run at base speed unable to sprint and pray your hp potion will save you from death.

Combat System:
Fundamentally I love the combat system. Press key 1, then get a choice of 3 options to follow up. No more needing to memorize long combos like in Black Desert Online, Tera, or World of Warcraft. Simple, oh my god yes please! Problem. Dang, no evasion, no blocking, no dodge, no sprinting while in combat, no movement will using a spell or skill, targetting is messy in the sense it will tab off to something 20 feet away, not looking at you and behind you. Live combat tab or whatever they call it is only an option for the Beserker at this time and nothing else. You have no way to formally block so you actually stand in front of someone hitting you and just pray they miss or you block. The combo system while is an amazing concept was executed harmfully in the sense you cannot even see your cooldowns to the used abilities in any way, shape and or form. So you just stand there after the first hit hoping to combo. If that's not bad enough, imagine being locked in an animation to heal your group only to get killed by an AoE a boss uses because your animation stops you from moving. IF THAT is not bad enough, tell me a game that doesn't have an option to flee at the very least! There's only one I can think of and that's if you're out of runes, and! IT IS RUNESCAPE! You know the game that gives you IMMUNITY to DAMAGE TYPES!

Founder Packs:
Nowhere is it stated they are character bound in their website, launcher, store page for steam or their personal one. While some items I can agree to be character bound like ""costumes"" or ""skins"" and I think most can agree to such to, but when the wording they use practically says they're account bound by the term they use ""Account Mail"" which is just the way you get your purchased in-game goods.. Sounded like it would be account bound by this method and I can claim it on a character. Cool! Wrong! It's not only character bound but you can only transfer that Founder Pack's items once! NOT THE VIP items! You know the infinite pickaxe or bag you get? The things that are super useful? Nope. Gone. Stuck to the character that claimed them! Doesn't even say in game you'll only get to make the claim to the Founder Pack once! I wouldn't be so fustrated if it wasn't for the fact I deleted my character prior to finding out their requirements to transfer because I didn't want to play in the faction I was actually STUCK with because I couldn't make a character on the other faction because it's PLAYER LIMIT was REACHED! So wanting to save my character names quick I opted for the other side. Only to find out more servers would be added, and my work increased... But I managed to get the faction I wanted to be on and deleted my old characters because I couldn't even get into that server anymore because the queue was for over 3000 people! And we were denied our Founder Packs until about 20-24 hours later a transfer, and since then I put a ticket in, since then I tried to contact support. Nothing! Almost ten hours of me writting this and nothing! 30+ total!

Gameplay:
I played ESO, Fiesta Online, Ragnarok Online 2, RuneScape Classic, Oldshool RuneScape, New RuneScape, MapleStory, World of Warcraft every expansion, Star Wars the Old Republic, Eve Online, WildStar, and so many others. I've never had a game once deny me character creation because the faction I wanted to be on was FULL! Ever! I don't know how to respond to that alone! Can you imagine playing World of Warcraft and being Denied the Horde or Alliance on a server because it was full and all your friends were on the faction locked to you? Can you imagine that? I ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE TO! Neither do you if you buy this game!
I won't lie I have some undergeared specs. i7 3770 at 4.0Ghz, 8gb x2 (16gb total) of ram at 2400, 1070 ti. I cannot play the game at max graphics, I can however play Black Desert Online in 4k with 30-40fps at max graphics, better if I lower. Tell me again how I can't play this game at max graphics at 1080 with 20+ fps? The game crashes constantly. If this says nothing to you, think about this. People were paid to go to their press showing for this game, essentially hired as contracted workers to produce content for this game. MANY of them are coming out saying they just cannot play this game anymore it's just that bad! AND IT HASN'T EVEN FULLY LAUNCHED YET!

On to the actual review.

Optimization:

Game runs like hot garbage, im sorry neo, but this game runs about as good as my dead hamster at times, Thankfully theres a fix on reddit that solves MOST but not all of the optimization problems to some extend 3/10



Gameplay:

I'm actually enjoying the combat a whole lot more then i thought, the first 25 levels or so on my Beserker felt awfull, zero mobility, absurdly long charge time on skills but as you get better gear and more skills the combat gets more and more fluid as you get alont, i understand that this is a deal breaker for some people but if you are willing to wait a bit you will have a pretty solid combat system infront of you, skill customization is pretty good too, you can really mold your class into specializing in what you want it to do, want an off tank beserker with tons of hp?, you can do it, Want a balanced beserker with Great defence?, you can do it aswell as the typical dps and glass cannon builds.

The guild system is incredibly well implimented and fleshed out.
The dungeons are alot more intriguing then most of the other recent mmorpgs i've played.
Gameplay 6/10 Low score due to bugs, glitches and boring early game.



Translation: 
i think they just reworked the korean version and implimented Google translate lol 2/10.

But unfortunately they didn't add the end game content they and their Emissaries advertised online. Now just a few hours ago a bug has been reported where you could duplicate items from the auction house, which is the FINAL dealbreaker for me.

To name a few reasons why:
- The game is unoptimized. Heavily. Probably the most unoptiomized game I've played in years. The graphics and visuals are okay, but even when you have a 1080ti - i7 - 16GB of Ram and good HDD, it stutters, lags, textures take a bit to load every time on characters, menus seem to stutter the game when you open them.
- The server issues are bad, too. Frequent disconnects, I've tried on both 20/20 and 50/50 VDSL. Didn't matter one bit. If there are too many connections, there's good chance you'll be stuck at Splash screen, no matter your connection. The game doesn't try to reconnect again and you're forced to restart the game. That might also happen if you randomly disconnect after finally getting in, so ATM you have a chance to be one of the lucky ones to not be disconnected, or be the unlucky ones who gets to play 20mins out of 4h you spend logging in.
- The translation is pretty bad. I suppose it could be forgiven, if the devs didn't say they spent 60 millions on getting the game to NA/EU.
- The combat system was dumbed down. If you're looking for an experience similiar to BDO or even Tera, you won't get it, not afaik anyway. I looked and looked and couldn't find the ""action combat"" option in menus, while it was there in JP version. Right now the NA/EU version has tab targetting, and sometimes it doesn't work.
- The voice over half the time sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom with an old mic too close to mouth, it's terrible.

I think that's all. And if the devs really improve the optimization, server issues and translations, I'd happily change this review and try the game again, but ATM, for the price, Bless Online is not worth leaving other MMO's for.

EDIT: 
- The game is still broken AF. The recent nerf of damage brought all classes to 50-75% DMG nerf which makes main story quests undoable as DPS.
- The marketplace is set in the same way as GW2 marketplace. There are no set prices.
- There is no account-shared storage. Also there is no player-to-player trading.
- The game has HUGE memory leak, taking 7-13GB of RAM when just on.

No, asi to byla jen naivní víra, když vezmeme v potaz, že ta hra selhala v Japonsku, Rusku a také její domovině a tím je Korea. Možná se ta hra dá dohromady jako nějaké jiné hry, které po čase povstaly z popela (například již zmiňovaná FFXIV), ale v tomto případě o tom pochybuji, no a teď ke konkrétním věcem.
1. Launch: Každý region dostal na startu jen jeden server, proč? Vždyť určitě věděli, že ta hra bude na startu přeplněná a jeden server nebude stačit, tohle pak vyvolalo řetězec problémů, kterým se dalo předejít.
2. Performance: Spousta lidí si stěžuje například na nízké fps, drop fps po otevření třeba báglu, statů, profesí…atd. Určitě by se toho našlo víc, ale já se to snažil ignorovat.
3. Combat: Ukazovali nám stále videa, kde je action combat a po zapnutí hry se dozvíme, že action combat má jen berserker, ostatní classy (mage, paladin, guardian, ranger) mají smůlu, prostě klikejte myší.
4. UI: Naprosto katastrofální UI, nemůžeme udělat absolutně nic, ani změnit velikost či posunout mapu nebo action bary, prostě nic. UI, které není hodné roku 2018.
5. Kamera: Nejhorší kamera v MMORPG, horší jsem nikde neviděl. Postava je naprosto nesmyslně postavena strašně dole, někde v jeskyni vůbec postavu nemohu vidět (problém prvního dungeonu).
6. Text: Můj skill v angličtině není velký, ale i já jsem si všiml, že v textu je hromada chyb a tím nemyslím nějaký překlep, ale třeba zaměnění slova, které naprosto změní význam celé věty. Například buff, který ti zvýší damage taken a správně tam má být damage done.
Vždyť na to měli hromadu času a oni nebyli schopni udělat pořádně ani takové základní věci jako je UI, text ve hře a kameru. Jako vím, že toto je early acces, ale tato hra běžela několik let v testovací verzi ve třech regionech. To je na tom to nejhorší, věděli co všechno je ve hře špatné, všechno co potřebuje dodělat/upravit a oni to prostě neudělali. Celý ten launch působil totálně neprofesionálně, jako by na tom pracovali lidi, kteří teprve dnes zjistili, že nějaké MMORPG existuje. Já jsem velmi naštvaný, prostě s námi vyjebali s úsměvem na tváři. Rozhodně hru v tomto stavu nemohu doporučit, stejně jako brutální většina ostatních lidí.

Kupiłem head starter 2 dniowy z myślą o graniu przez 2 dni szybciej... co się nie udało, na szczęście dostałem Refunda za tą grę. wątpie że w przyszłości wrócę do tej gry jak ją dopracują ale robią to kilka ładnyc lat a efektów zero, więc... 

Kupiłem z nadzieją że zagram w cos nowego, świeżego, no ale sie nieźle zawiodłem. Wydaje mi się, że to nie przypadek że nie było żadnej open bety tego Blesa. Ci sami zdziwieni nawet chyba  że tyle ludzi na tym headstarcie to kupiło bo im serwera brakło. 2018 a na dobrego nowego mmorpg-a nie masz co liczyć.

To moja opinia, można spróbować a może przypadnie wam do gustu i nie będziecie mieli takich wymagań i oczekiwań jakie ja miałem co do tej gry. Gry raczej szybko nie zamkną bo ludzi sporo, ale zobaczymy jak się to rozwinie i co będzie za kilka miesięcy. Pozdrawiam.

Der Start war mehr als nur holprig und das Spiel wird noch von sehr vielen Dingen geplagt. Die Server sind nicht stabil, Splashscreenfehler und mäßige Performance dank DX9. Dazu sind die PvP-Arenen und Battlegrounds noch nicht drin und Dinge wie Actioncam (nur Bersi hat die im Moment) fehlen.
Aber: 

Das Spiel macht Spaß. Mir zumindest. Das Combatsystem ist flüssig und erlaubt für schöne PvP-Kämpfe. Die Welt ist riesig und an jeder Ecke steht ein NPC der irgendwas von einem will. Bless hat viel Potential, sehr viel sogar. Die gemachten Änderungen passen es sehr gut an den westlichen Markt an. Der Cashshop ist ein reiner Nebenschauplatz und beeinflusst das Spiel quasi garnicht. 

Wer ein dickes Fell hat kann jetzt schon Spielen und Spaß haben. Wer sein Geld gerne vorsichtig ausgibt, der sollte auf einen Sale oder ähnliches Warten oder dem Spiel mehr Zeit geben. Egal ob es bereits in anderer Weise veröffentlicht wurde, die Unterschiede zur Rebuildversion aus JP sind groß. Neowiz wird noch viel Arbeit haben dem Spiel die ganzen Kidnerkrankheiten auszutreiben und auf DX11 irgendwann zu upgraden. Wer ein schönes Casualspiel sucht mit ner netten Story und ner schönen Welt ist mit Bless gut bedient. Für die 30€ bietet es genug Content um sich ausgiebig mit dem Spiel zu beschäftigen. Wer von anderen MMOs, welche seit Jahren laufen und bereits ihre Probleme ausgebügelt haben, verwöhnt ist sollte besser weg bleiben. Bless ist ein ungeschliffener Diamant.

0,11,2,6196,6196,76561198201018315,0,german,False,42381372,"Also ich finde das Spiel bis jetzt ganz in Ordnung. Ich hatte irgendwie das Glück nicht solche Probleme zu haben wie manch anderer. Nach zwei, drei Versuchen und Änderung an der Bildschirmauflösung startete das Spiel immer. Mal aus dem Launcher heraus oder aus dem Steamordner. Die Ausfallzeiten wegen Serverabstürtzen find ich persönlich nicht so schlimm. Ich bin da gelassener geworden mit den Jahren... Ändern kann ich eh nicht. Es wurde laut Twitter immer daran gearbeitet. Den Ärger wegen der geschlossenen Charaktererstellung auf manchen Servern kann ich nachvollziehen. Dies ist aber nur temporär laut deren Angaben und da gibt es bestimmt was, um das zu ändern.

Die Grafik finde ich auch in Ordnung und die Welt sieht gut aus. Performance (wenn die Server einigermaßen laufen) ist bei mir auch soweit in Ordnung.  Ein paar Ruckler hier und da aber im Großen und Ganzen kann ich spielen (wie heute morgen mehrere Stunden am Stück). Regelt sich bestimmt auch mit den Tagen. Eine FPS-Anzeige über Steam Overlay habe ich leider nicht, da bei Aktivierung des Overlays bei mir das Spiel nicht startet. Somit kann ich hierzu nichts sagen. Aber die FPS kann soweit bei mir nicht runtergehen, denn sonst könnte ich, wie gesagt, nicht ohne Megalaggs spielen. Liegt aber auch bestimmt daran wann man spielt. 

Da es zurzeit für mich keine anderen MMO's gibt, die mich begeistern, sei es den AFK-Simulator BDO oder Skyforge oder TERA oder oder oder, ist für mich die Investition von 40€ nicht in den Sand gesetzt und ich möchte sehen wohin sich das Spiel entwickelt. 

Was ich aber nicht in Ordnung finde, dass auf der Shopseite gestanden hat, und somit auch in meinen Augen beworben wurde, dass das Spiel auf deutsch sein wird. Außer als Untertitel in Videosequenzen ist davon nichts zu sehen. Vielleicht wird es zu heute ja implementiert. Ob nun die englischen Texte grauenhaft übersetzt wurden, kann ich mit Bestimmtheit nicht sagen aber ich hab verstanden worum es geht und was zu tun war. Aktuell wurde die Sprachangabe deutsch entfernt. Viele geben an, dass man gescheiterte Quests nicht abbrechen kann. Dem ist nicht so... Wer lesen kann ist klar im Vorteil :-)

Das Aktivieren von Fähigkeiten finde ich auch gewöhnungsbedürftig. Die Hauptfähigkeiten liegen auf den Tasten 1, 2 und 3 und danach kann man eine Kette aktivieren mit e, r oder y.... irgendwie spielt sich das komisch für mich.

Den Shop In-Game finde ich nicht überteuert. Ebenfalls kann man sich im Spiel Währungen erspielen und in die Währung des Shops umwandeln.

So enttäuscht wie viele andere bin ich nicht. Ich hab aber auch keine 150€ investiert. 

Wer also ein MMO mit den klassichen MMO-Inhalten spielen möchte und bereit ist 40€ zu zahlen und sich zurzeit der Gefahr aussetzen möchte sich tot zu ärgern, weil es nicht so funtzt wie erwartet, der sollte es sich anschauen. Ob Ihr dabei auch so wenig Probleme haben werdet wie ich bleibt offen.

Quitando el hecho de los mil inconvenientes que tiene a la hora de abrir el juego, lo cual ya te resta tiempo de este, resulta que los servidores se pasan más tiempo caidos que otra cosa. Empezando por ese punto creo yo que ya debería de haber por lo mínimo una compensación, porque no es de adivinos saber que el 90% de los que han comprado dicho pack es ni más ni menos que para jugar antes.

Otro tema es: Si es cierto que ha habido poca información en si del juego, también puede jugarse uno la mano diciendo que esta poca información ha sido engañosa. Engañosa del tipo que te muestra una optimización, unos gráficos y una jugabilidad que no es verdad. Bien, lo gráficos si se los subes al máximo puede que se igualen a los que se mostraban en los videos, pero, siendo como es que con un muy muy buen ordenador que tengo me es imposible no ya ponerlos en máximos, sino incluso en medios ¿Me puede decir alguien si es que en la letra pequeña de algun video ponía que requiero de un ordenador de la NASA?. No, no es cosa mia, ni de ningun error de lanzamiento, esto lleva pasando desde la versión coreana.

Hablo de su versión estandar. 30 euros de versión estandar siendo que hay otros, como lo es el black deser (un ejemplo entre otros muchos)  que valen tan solo 10.

The frame rates are below 30 even on a high end computer, the graphics, also due to the use of direct x 9 (used with win 98 and win 2000 server) and the unreal 3 engine (2012) are not even close to be considered state of the art  - environment and character models look like what you would expect from a title from 10 years ago, voice acting, if it is there and working is poorly done with almost no respect to the surroundings.
Announcing the game as fully voice acted is nothing but a joke, especially as your own character still has no voice or immersive interaction. The very few story-missions, if they can be described as such do not even offer you any conversational choice besides accepting a mission straight away or get some more useless information that is neither relevant, nor has any bigger context. After leaving your race specific starting area (with no real meaning for the rest of the game), you end up with the same guy, leading you down the same path as everyone else. 
Ultimately, in order to reach higher levels, you just end up doing the ultimative level grind in form of super repetitive, uncreative and boring hunt / kill missions and soloing the first dungeons solo about 15 times each - and even the dungeons can't be described as anything more than a couple of npc's  being placed in a confined area.

I could go on with stating issues with this poor excuse of a MMO for hours, tho thruth be told, it is just not worth the time.

This is a general warning for those who want to get a good experience and game for their hard earned cash - Do not buy this game.


I have had my copy refunded and rather spend more time on waiting for an actual good new MMO that might come somewhen in the future.

I'll start this by saying if you want a great solid MMO that is release worthy this isn't for you... Yet.

The usual launch issues you would expect are here, however I feel like they have been dealt with rather well new servers swiftly added, maintenance to address any large issues and most importantly communication. That already is topping BDO for me.

Now with that seems to put most people off out the way.. The good points.


[h1]The Good[/h1]
The combat is super fun, I'm playing a bezerker and it feels great when you land a good combo. The level of power that increases as you level up is satisfying for experienced MMO players.

I personally think the fact a combo breaks if the enemy evades is a nice touch. Requires you to be paying attention instead of spamming mindlessly.
Spell animations look good and feel engaging also.

The character creation is very detailed, not quite on the same level as BDO but very close. Loads of options to play with and it's nice and easy to use.

Faction locked. The fact if you create 1 character of a faction you cannot create another of the opposite faction. I think this is great and something I miss for MMOs like this. I fondly remember playing WoW years ago and getting to know people on the opposite faction via world PvP and battlegrounds. This is something I'm looking forward to!


[h1]The Meh[/h1]
The translations are poor, and for what it is I can accept that. I've played multiple EA games that don't even have tooltips at an early stage or correct graphics so I can forgive that.

Performance isn't great, it's lower than what I would expect for a UE3 MMO however as a software developer I can understand that the bulk of optimisation would be better handled later so again, I'll forgive that too. It is possible to get a smooth framerate with some INI tweaks that maybe should have been there to start with..

The game looks good, there's a few niggles like just improved resolution on textures would make everything look much nicer - but again EA.

The keybinds I personally think are a bit awkward, switching stances with the ` key - doesn't seem to work but no worries I map these to macros on my mouse.


[h1]The Straight Bad[/h1]
Breaking bugs, a rather annoying bug where you are hit with a blue splash screen when trying to login. This is by far the most frustrating bug currently and Neowiz are working to get this fixed. Still, when you're paying extra to play 2 days early it would be nice to get some time in. About 5 hours of my played has been it sat at a loading screen due to this.

Translations again, I'll mention this again here as for some this could be a deal breaker. There is a specific quest in the tutorial where you have to equip a skill tree of sorts. There's only 1 you can equip but with the translation being totally wrong a lot of people are getting confused by this.


[h1]To Conclude[/h1]
Despite some of the bad points it is early access and it's going to be a slow process getting it to worthy non-EA point. But providing they keep working on it and are making progress I will happily keep playing and recommend the game to friends.

Also ich würde hier jetzt nur das gleiche schreiben wie alle anderen. Das Spiel ist teilweise einfach unspielbar und es ist auch an vielen stellen nicht zu Ende gedacht. Solange sich da nichts ändert, wird es bei dieser Bewertung bleiben, auch wenn es an vielen stellen ein spielenswertes MMO ist. RIP 150 Euro

Edit 5.6 um 9 Uhr:
Bless EA ist jetzt eine Woche alt und ich habe ein bisschen Spielerfahrung gesammelt, wenn ich genau überlege viel zu viel für 7 Tage, ach egal Arbeitslosigkeit regelt. So eine Menge ist diese Woche passiert viel Gutes aber auch eher schlechtes.

Fangen wir an mit den extremen Server Problemen aus den ersten drei Tagen diese haben sich erledigt und alle Leittragenden haben IG Währung im Wert von glaube ich 10 Euro bekommen vielleicht mehr. Das Bless Team hat sich entschuldigt und Fehler eingesehen, dies war auf jedenfalls der richtige weg, doch die frage wie und warum es überhaupt zu dem ganzen Problem kommen konnte bleibt wohl ungeklärt. Ich mein man sollte damit rechnen, wenn man ein spiel stark promotet das mehr als 50 Leute beim EA mit machen und das dann halt die Minecraft Nitrado Server nicht mehr ausreichen, um Bless am Laufen zu halten.

Dann gab es die ersten Tage viele kleine Bugs, die schlimmsten wurden mittlerweile alle gefixt, dies hat das Bless Team meiner Meinung nach auch gut gemacht aber dies ist eigentlich auch zu erwarten.

Die schlechte Performance vom Spiel haben sie leider noch nicht gefixt aber sie sind dabei und es ist besser als beim Start und es gibt viele Möglichkeiten diese Performance Probleme zu umgehen.

Das größte Problem ist momentan der DMG Nerf, es wurde der schaden aller Klassen um ca. 60% heruntergeschraubt, da dieser eindeutig zu hoch war, PVP bestand daraus wer den ersten Hit rausbekommt. Dieser DMG Nerf war aber leider übereilt und nicht durchdacht. Es gibt viele Sachen, die noch angepasst werden müssen. Ich könnte auf dutzende Sachen eingehen, aber das mache ich jetzt mal nicht, da das Bless Team ja schon am Anpassen ist.

Nun zu einem für mich sehr Großen Problem dem PvP. Also PvP besteht aus Magiern die ungefähr das mach ""2222222222222222222222222222222"" PS. auf 2 liegt ihr Eis spam, welcher immer noch zu stark ist und beim Magier jegliche Chains überflüssig macht. Der Paladin, welchen ich auf Lvl 45 gespielt habe kann eigentlich nur der Magier, was anhaben sonst besteht mein Leben daraus mich dauerhaft Hoch zuheilen, bis der Gegner keine Lust mehr hat und abhaut. Außerdem hat mir jemand den ""Broken Paladin"" beigebracht ein Paladin Spam, mit welchem man den Gegner einfach die ganze zeit auf dem Boden Liegenlassen kann. Natürlich stirbt dieser nicht, da der Paladin welcher immer schon nur mit einem Kricket Hammer gekämpft hat, nun nach dem DMG nerf mit einem Schaumstoff Hammer kämpft aber das ist nicht so schlimm, da es momentan allen Klassen nicht so gut geht. Nun mal zu Duellen, wenn ich gegen Magier Kämpfe wird es nicht leicht, bei allen anderen Klassen wird aus einem Duell eine Schneeballschlacht, man tut dem anderen zwar weh, aber so richtig sterben wollen sie alle nicht. Diese Duelle ziehen sich dann bis zu 10 Minuten, irgendwann Schaft man es einen Freund zu erreichen, der dann kommt, um einen Buff auf einen der Duellanten anzuwenden, so das dieses abgebrochen wird.

Nun zu meiner momentan Beschäftigung: Nix
Also ich würde sehr gerne noch zumindest den momentan verfügbaren Endgame Conttent ausnutzen nur leider geht dies nicht da die 43 und 45 Dungeon für Normalsterbliche nach dem DMG nerf nicht Schafbar sind. Ich, welcher sich für 150 euro dieses spiel gekauft hat, hat nun aber kein geld mehr dafür meine grüne 45 Rüssi auf +10 zu machen also muss ich momentan warten, bis der HP Nerf der Monster draußen ist.

Und wie verbringt man diese zeit am besten? Genau man macht aus Bless das neue Pokemon und versucht alle 660 Pokemonster zu fangen. Und als mir aufgefallen ist das ich nur 40 Pokemonster in meine Tasche stecken kann, musste ich mir eine neue Beschäftigung suchen. Diese ist es in der Hieron Hauptstadt zu stehen und ausersehen die Magier zu Healen wenn sie in einem Duell sind, so das dieses unterbrochen wird, um für Spannung zu sorgen.

Also mein Fazit für ein spiel, das angeblich im EA ist, aber schon Lange in Korea gespielt werden kann: War die 12Stunden Pro Tag wert aber es wäre schon nice wenn ich noch was zu tun hätte. Für 30 Euro kann man nix falsch machen die Entwickler sind am Ball. Momentan kriegt Bless 4/10 Gummipunkten ma gucken wie die nächsten Updates ablaufen ich passe meine Bewertung ggf. an.

Ps. Bei Bless kann man natürlich viel rumheulen, weil einfach viele Sachen falsch gelaufen sind, doch man sollte an die Sache gechillt rangehen.

Like the majority of the Bless steam community i have been stuck on the Bless loading screen for hours apon hours, having to close the game through task manager and reboot it all just to hope, that by some chance the servers let me in.... and 99% of the time they wont. 

Once in the game i did enjoy my brief time with the new combat, it seemed fun to me, although i never played the oldder versions to know how much better it felt compared to those releases. For what it was it felt a little slow, but with a lot of possible out comes. Would have been nice to see how it played at max level.... but that will never be.
Action cam that was promised to us pre release as a feature that would help to fix combat was NOT in game apart for the zerker class.... all other classes had the feature turned OFF for some stupid reason. So the cam whilst in combat was a total nightmare whilst you have to 100% of the time hold down and maintain rightmouse button, if released and you happen to be trying to move left or right with A and D keys your cam will turn and totally disorientate your screen off the target... its so bad -_-.

As well as the totally unoptimized servers and terrible lag issues. They pretty much promised this would all be sorted for westen release. Well another lie... it was absolute garbage. So unoptimized you actually HAVE to change all the ini file entrys yourslef just so the game picks up on your hardware.... REALLY... in this day and age the game didnt detect my hardware so thats why its not optimized LOL ok neowiz... ok.

I could go on all day with the cons and pros but theres no point. becuase if you buy the game as it is right now ... you'll be lucky if you can even get into the servers and not be stuck at the Bless loading screen.

Such hype, much hope, very disapointing.

Needless to say i got me a full refund from a Deluxe Edition, even though in game it said clearly no refunds.... dont believe that for a second... even if your over steams two hour game play policy AND the ingame warnings about using founders pack items... Steam have been great and recognised that this game lied to buyers before hand and that NEOWIZ has not delivered on promised content/playability. If you wont play this game and you already bought it... get your money back and purchase a playable game on steam instead.

Es un MMORPG y como todos, ya esperaba colas, problemas de estabilidad e incluso imposibilidad de conectar, es lo habitual.

Lo que hace que no recomiende su compra es el estado actual de desarrollo del juego, de verdad que espero y deseo que el juego prospere y se arreglen todas las carencias, pero no recomiendo la compra porque lo vais a probar y vais a salir asqueados sin ganas de volver, y es una pena. Promete mucho, no sé si lo conseguirá o no, pero desde luego como le deis una oportunidad en este mismo momento, puede que le cojáis hasta manía.

Supongo que si hubiese cogido la versión básica quizás lo hubiera mantenido, pero desde luego, coger la coleccionista y encontrar semejante despropósito ha sido de reembolso.

La idea del juego y todo su Lore, etc. está muy bien, pero no pueden enmascarar un juego con unos fallos muy graves que creo que muchos de ellos pueden solucionarlos, pero no sé si lo harán. 

La traducción al inglés del juego es de lo peor que he visto nunca, no entiendo cómo han podido hacer algo así. Las quest no están bien diseñadas y algunas resultaran confusas para los más profanos, hay gente que incluso se ha quedado atascada en el tutorial por la mala traducción de la quest.

El juego no está nada optimizado, y parece más dejadez que otra cosa. Los .ini del juego contienen hasta la configuración básica del motor para iPad, móviles... esto denota poco trabajado, no han limpiado nada, todo metido como un batiburrillo. No entiendo como no han podido poner la configuración directamente en el juego, únicamente te dejan cuatro males opciones que ni funcionan. De ahí que la mayor parte de la gente se quede varada en la pantalla de carga. Todo por una mala implementación de la configuración.

Los fallos que tenían las otras versiones lanzadas del juego continúan presentes, algo impensable si realmente se hubiese trabajado el juego.

En definitiva, o han lanzado una versión primitiva de lo que estaban preparando por falta de tiempo, o si realmente esta es la versión que ellos daban como definitiva y sobre la que seguir trabajando, tienen muchísimo trabajo por delante.

El juego en sí y según mi opinión, lo encuentro un poco flojo en selección de Jobs de lanzamiento, demasiado pocos para un juego en estos tiempos. Panteras y lobos únicamente tres opciones, me parecen pocas.
El sistema de apuntado, mediante target tendrá sus detractores y sus defensores, a mí no me parece mal, pero el sistema de combos no me ha gustado, las teclas hay que cambiarlas, no están para nada acertadas, pero se hace simple, demasiado simple para mi gusto, quizás a nivel máximo la cosa mejora, pero por lo que he leído no parece así.

La falta de contenido es evidente, pero también es algo que se supone que se soluciona durante el tiempo que este en acceso anticipado hasta que salga definitivamente.

La interfaz... esto se ha de cambiar totalmente, es una interfaz anticuada, confusa y para nada optimizada. Con algunas carencias muy notables a la hora de personalizar, por ejemplo.

La tienda online para compra de objetos con dinero real está ""bien"" en el sentido de que no hacen del juego un P2W (un par de cosillas que tampoco mataran a los que no las compren), eso está bien trabajado. Los precios no me he parado a ver si son muy caros o no tanto. A simple vista me han parecido un poco caros, pero esto es relativo.

Los movimientos y animaciones, correctos, sin más. 

A nivel de gráficos, me gusta, pero se nota el paso del tiempo, no son unos gráficos para echar cohetes, pero cumplen su cometido.

Supongo que serán por los graves problemas de configuración, pero la interacción con el agua, o partículas, esta poco trabajada, pero casi seguro que es por los problemas al configurar que tiene. No me extrañaría nada que tocando los .ini esto mejore sustancialmente.

El aspecto de los personajes está ""bien"" sin ser la panacea que parecía que iba a ser. Pero cumplen, aunque el motor anticuado no deja que brillen más.

Las cinemáticas, están bastante acertadas, aunque su ejecución me resulto un tanto torpe, pero me imagino que mayoritariamente por los problemas con los servers. Empezaban de golpe sin transición alguna y daba la sensación de que se había comido alguna frase. Nada que no se arregle fácilmente. Me parecieron bien y quizás alguna de ellas hasta interesante.

El sentimiento de ""épico"" para mi importante en estos juegos, vamos, sentirte como que realmente lo que estás haciendo tiene un peso en la historia, en los primeros compases del juego es muy pobre, espero que mejore en el tiempo.

Y básicamente, lo que os decía al principio. Si vais a darle una oportunidad, mejor esperar a que este pulido el juego porque de lo contrario podéis agobiaros mucho. Y si lo hacéis hacedlo con el pack básico, no os lancéis a la versión coleccionista porque os arrepentiréis. Pensad que luego se podrá actualizar de una versión a otra. Yo personalmente ha sido tan mal el sabor de boca que me he llevado que me esperare a ver como evoluciona antes de volver a darle una oportunidad.

[h1]Cannot teleport to dungeons without spending real money[/h1]
Whereas in other popular MMOs you get teleported to dungeons for free, on Bless Online you are forced to either walk there or spend cash shop currency each time.

[b]See: https://i.imgur.com/QF5QkoU.png[/b]

You would think that they would have at least included it as a $15 monthly sub benefit, but even that would have been bad. The developers are finding ways to milk players dry of their money in any way possible, even though the game just came out and is B2P (with an optional $15 sub AND cash shop). There is also no cross-server queueing for dungeons like you would expect from an MMO in 2018.

[h1]Infinitely loading splash screen bug and no communication from developers[/h1]
The game needs to be restarted repeatedly until it finally loads, usually taking around ~20 client restarts each time. I myself have already restarted the game around 60 times today just to play a few times. This infinite loading screen issue has been present for well over 40 hours now, and the developers are not even acknowledging the issue or talking about a potential hotfix, even though thousands of players have been complaining about it all day long. It just feels extremely unprofessional on their end, both from an apparent lack of (any) testing and a lack of communication.

[h1]Inaccurate and absurd Toontown-like chat and name filtering[/h1]
There is forced chat filtering (which cannot be disabled) that censors words such as ""how"" or ""who"" since the word ""ho"" is detected in them, which makes me feel like I am playing a broken version of Toontown from 2008. Players are restricted from using player names such as ""Muffin"" as well. For a game that has been in development since 2009 with a $60 million NA port budget, this is just outright embarrassing.

The reasoning for any form of filtering does not make sense either, since the game was marketed towards adults, and there is mild nudity in the game. You can also set your boob sliders very high and make your character very erotic looking.

[h1]Poor English Translation[/h1]
The English translation is obscure and riddled with errors. Due to the poor translation, some quest tasks are too confusing to complete, and it is hard to understand what your character's abilities actually do. Even the most basic of things, such as the level up message that pops up each time you level up, has badly formatted text and is bunched together.

[b]See: https://i.imgur.com/XHn0gH4.png[/b]

[h1]Lack of UI settings, screen resolution bug, and terrible default settings[/h1]
It is not possible to change your screen resolution through the ingame settings without causing the game to freeze and blackscreen, which forces you to restart your PC. As of right now, the only way to safely change your ingame screen resolution is to directly edit the config files.

It is also not possible to customize the UI interface at all. You cannot resize core UI parts such as the chat or the mini-map. And there is a massive lack of game settings in general. [b]Want to turn off the 60 FPS cap, increase your game FOV, or disable the inconsistent mouse smoothing? You have to manually modify the config files.[/b]

[h1]Terrible Optimization[/h1]
I get 30 FPS and stutter in more than half of the areas in the game (even worse in populated areas such as the city), despite having a GTX 1080, i7 7700k and an optimized config. I can only imagine what sort of unplayable performance I would get in a 100vs100 battleground.

[b]Streamers opinon about the game (both streaming with 100k viewers at the time):[/b] https://clips.twitch.tv/BlatantFineFriesBCWarrior

[h1]Item Dupe Bug[/h1]
There is an item dupe bug that is still present from the previous, outdated versions of the game. There are already thousands of duped items, again without any acknowledgement from the developers about a potential rollback or anything. The fact that the developers even released the game, without fixing this [b][i]known issue[/i][/b] beforehand, is just beyond me.

[b]See:[/b] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M8dXV3AUwQQ

[h1]Buggy tab-targeting and lack of fluid action combat[/h1]
When you tab target, it sometimes randomly targets the enemy behind you. An action-cam mode would fix this, but there is no action-cam mode for any of the classes except the Berserker, and even on the Berserker it does not feel natural.

Additionally, a lot of the attack animations lock you down in place so it does not feel fluid at all, and to make it even worse, some of the chain animations have a delay that makes it feel as if you are playing with 500ms.

[h1]Problems with potential future server merge / losing player names[/h1]
Instead of adding shared servers and more channels, the developers decided to add 6 more  servers on both NA and EU, which will become a huge problem in the future when the game's hype dies down. The servers will likely merge in an effort to boost player interaction, and some players will be forced to pick new player names (and maybe even lose their guild) due to them already being taken.

[h1]Excluding classes and content from the game on purpose[/h1]
The game is missing the Assassin and Mystic and pretty much all of the endgame content that is present in other versions of the game, which the developers probably took out intentionally just so that they could gradually add the ""new"" content through the course of a couple of years without doing any real dev work.

And oddly enough, even though the Assassin class is not in the game, enemies still drop Assassin gear which is useless.

[h1]No Endgame - developers deceived players about there being one[/h1]
The current version of the game, compared to the versions on RU and KR, is missing a lot of endgame features.

Some missing features are:[list][*][i]No Daily Dungeons[/i]
[*][i]No Arenas or Battlegrounds[/i]
[*][i]No PvP Ranking System[/i]
[*][i]No PvP Reward System[/i]
[*][i]Basel Canyon (main PvP map) is empty without mobs[/i]
[*][i]No Royal or Honor Quests[/i]
[*][i]Only two ""end game"" dungeons with exactly same gear score drops[/i]
[*][i]SLEVELS (for unlocking last 2 stances and trait points) are not implemented, so you cannot progress past level 45.[/i]
[*][i]Skill Gem acquisition is broken[/i]
[*][i]No migra turris hard mode (or whatever name they gave it in our version)[/i]
[/list]

The developers were quite deceiving about the lack of features as well -- selling founder packs and advertising a headstart as if there was an end to run to, plus falsely advertising about there being some end-game boss dungeons which are not present in the current version of the game.

[h1]Pay2Win, Overpriced Cash Shop, cash shop currency is CHARACTER bound[/h1]
Cash shop currency is restricted to the specific character that you bought it on, rather than your entire account like in other MMOs, which is quite obnoxious.

And even though the game just came out and the developers claim a pure B2P, non-P2W marketing model, there are still a lot of convenience items in the cash shop, such as potions, experience and gold boosters, repair kits, resurrection scrolls, teleport scrolls, and even 20% dungeon point boosters. All of these items do give you a competitive advantage over other players even if only through faster progression, which I personally would consider P2W nonetheless.

On top of spending $30 for the game and an optional $15 sub, you still have to spend $20 on stuff like costumes, pet customes, pets, and mounts, or $15 to change your character's appearance. 

Want more inventory slots? Spend $10 for 8 inventory slots.

Want to reset your skill tree and try out a new build? Spend $5 in the cash shop for a reset scroll.

Graphics: The game looks good, not groundbreaking but good with a solid character creator. The game had choppy frames before messing with the .ini file, fixes found on Bless Online Reddit. (Nvidia 1080)

Sound: The sound is very solid in the game, the only gripe I have with it is the NPC voices sound off, like they are in a tube or recorded in a can. (Massdrop x Sennheiser PC37X Gaming Headset)

Combat: The combat, is not amazing, but it feels good after you get used to it. Not a whole lot to say about it, just that it feels better than pressing  numbers in sequence. 

Optimization: Well this is easily the worst part of the game launch. I run 3440x1440 (21:9) and there is no optimization for this, which is a bummer, The FPS problem is no fun and needing to go into the ini file to fix it was pretty lame, but after that it has been very good. 

UI: Has some downsides, getting used to the ""mount"" function of applying skills to your tool bar was odd, but only took a few seconds to figure out.

Quests: Overall the quests are fun, and have an alright narrative. Though a few are bugged, this is to be expected on launch, though the game has been out for years and this is not its first “Launch”. 

Taming: The taming system is awesome, and easily the highlight of the game for me. 

Server stability has been an issue over the past few days in early access, which is also to be expected for a launch of any MMO. 

All in all I am enjoying the game, and hope you give it a go as well, thanks for reading.

I have what I consider a mid/high range pc and the game ran like it was on a laptop that was below minimum

Adding access to the cash shop so early is a huge red flag for me they should be focused on fixing the basic elements of the game and not making a ton of money from the early access especially since they ask for money upfront, it looks like they are trying to milk a dying cow, I would have expected that they would have given the game some extra polish releasing it in 2018 with what looks and  feels like a f2p MMO from 2006.. You would have thought with all the failures in the past few years from different MMORPGs they would have took notes but sadly this is not the case and while it is in early access I don't think this cow has much left to give and I dont think no amount of players playing it will make a difference.

You can't really start getting into the juice of this game till you've spent at least several hours first.

Anyways! It's no secret the early 2 day release of this game has been a mess. But as a MMO vet, I was expecting this. The downtimes, server lag and issues are all TYPICAL for a early access MMO. Neowiz worked swifly to open up new servers to handle the amount of players and have been constantly patching it to fix issues.

What some fail to realize is that this is a early access game for NA and EU; it would be a miracle if there were no issues! We're essentially beta testing the game and it's up to us to find the bugs and report them. 

Now, with all of that out of the way, the game as been a blast for me! I'm already level 39, inspite of all the downtime, and I'm having so much fun taming pets and mounts and exploring the word.

My favorite part of the game? The combat system and pet taming. No joke, I've never played a MMO with such a unique combat system. Neowiz made the right choice in changing it before releasing it for NA/EU. 

As for taming, if you like to collect cool looking creatures, this game is for you. It can be a bit confusing at first, but once you learn how to tame, upgrade and level up your mounts and pets the rest comes easy.

I'm looking forward to the open-world pvp (already killed a few!) and guildVSguild fights. 

Here's the thing, I know there are issues; but none of them are game breaking and Neowiz is working as quickly as they can to fix them. 

If you're looking for a new MMO to play and enjoy open-world pvp and very fun combat, this is the game for you.

Die Bewegung des Charakters sieht unnatürlich aus, das Kampsystem ist für meinen Geschmack auch nicht das Gelbe vm Ei... Man kann zum Beispiel als Nahkämpfer durch einen gegner hindurchlaufen, 3 Meter von ihm entfernt sein und mit dem Rücken zu ihm gewand sein, und obwohl man in die andere Richtung schlägt trifft man den Gegner immer noch. Meistens nutzt man bis lvl 30 ungefäht nur einen einzigen Skill, und zwar den der den kürzesten cd hat und selbst nach lvl 30 scheint man nicht zwingend andere Skills verwenden zu müssen.

 Mit lvl 32 hab ich nun das Game aufgegeben. Die Ballungsgebiete sind nett gemacht, aber was zwischen den Städten und Dörfern vorzufinden ist, ist eine nicht komplett scheinende, fast schon an vielen Stellen lieblos zusammengeschusterte, langweilige Einöde. Das Questsystem ist oftmal schlecht übersetzt und erklärt nur in den seltesten Fällen wie man etwas zu tun hat. Ein Beispiel für schlechtes Quest Design und von denen gibt es noch viel viel mehr, ist zum Beispiel eine Quest in der man ein Pferd bekommt und man soll es Verbessern. Die Quest Aufgabe und Beschreibung der Quest ist die selbe: ""Verstärke dein Pferd"" aber wie und womit, oder bei wem, oder irgendeine Information wohim man muss, wird nicht angegeben. Von sowelchen Quests werdet ihr einige vorfinden. 

Ansonnsten, einige Bugs, ich konnte zum Beispiel nicht mit der Tastenkombination die Kampftaktiken welche verschiedene Skilltools beinhalten verwenden, da es schlicht einfach nicht funktioniert hat. Ich muss das Game immer wieder bis zu 20 mal neu starten um überhaupt in die Charakterauswahl zu kommen. Ich bin ein paar mal einfach steckengeblieben und konnte mich nicht mehr bewegen und ein paar mal wurden im Kampf die Models der Gegner nicht angezeigt. Andere Sachen die mich tierisch generft haben ist, dass der Charakter sich bloß im Schneckentempo bewegt, beim Sprinten keine Ausdaueranzeige angezeit wird und falls man sich doch mal dafür entscheidet auf dem Pferd zu reiten, dies bloß ein bisschen schneller ist und die Bewegungsanimation vom Pferd äußerst minnimalistisch aussieht. 

Die Dungeons sind teilweise mega einfach. Über die Endgamedungeons kann ich jedoch nichts sagen, weil ich wie gesagt mit lvl 32 aufgehört habe. Ich wollte mich nicht weiter durchquälen. Es gibt noch einige andere Sachen die mich gestört haben, das ginge aber zu sehr ins Detail und das Review würde zu lange werden. Alles in allem ein MMORPG das alles bietet, nur halt bloß recht halbherzig. 

Wer Archeage gespielt hat, Black Desert oder The Elder Scrolls Online ist in einem dieser Spiele meiner Meinung nach besser aufgehoben. Bless müss noch ordentlich Entwicklungszeit genießen, bevor ich es könnte.

Ich gebe dem Spiel 5/10 und das mit der Erwartung, dass einige dieser Bugs zügig berinigt werden, ansonnsten wären es sogar nur 4/10 Punkten und somit absolut nicht empfehlenswert.

nearly all negativ comments are just complains about the server performance and I have to agree it´s bad BUT the game itself is very nice. Is it the first game which got problems with server and other things at the very beginning? I don´t think so (EA titel are allways nice ^^). All who played WoW at the beginning of Dreanor or Legion know server problems are very common in mmorpgs at the start. I think the posts are not fair and I play WoW active, too.

Now to the game:
Pro
- Nice combat system (chains while your are running for example the mage) very active compared to WoW.  
- Graphic is very nice for a mmorpg 
- City desing is very beautiful
- Landscape is also nice so far
- Charakter creation holds so much possibilitys (I would compare it with Sims)
- Automatic Pathfinding works fine exept of elevators
- Mount and Pet system is nice
- Nice story telling with cinematics

Con
--- You have to multiple log in because of the EU servers ((Problem was solved after 2 days.))
- Servers are very crowded which follows to fps laggs 
- FPS breaks, in citys (Reduce the shadow details and it works better)
- From time to time there are quests which are a little bit unclear what u have to do
- Little detail fails like floating a little bit over the mount
- Dublikate bug ingame, ((but they work on it and reset all dublikated items and gold which was earned with the bug + multy use of the bug leads to bans up to 15 days.)) 

I haven´t informed myself about the game before and it was a very impulsive purchase so I can only make a commend about what I see and not about what was the plan for the game. I see a high potential in this game.
All in all I would definitely recommend the game.

Besides the issue with the bad customer support in their forum/discord, the game has several performance and mechanics problems that simply should not exist in an old game that had been launched in 3 different regions.  My main complains on the games are:

[list]
[*] Ridiculously high requirement for Directx 9 and UE3.  Yet the game still have massive performance problem.
[*] Very underwhelming combo system and wonky tab targeting that just felt more like work.
[*] Keybinds are constantly lost and requires rebinding.
[*] Quests sometimes takes ages to register (10-30 minute long) and go to next phase.
[*] Poor translation quality.  Google translate at least would produce results that's guessable.
[/list]

My system surpasses the recommended spec and able to run 60fps in some area.  Nonetheless, there are a lot of micro stuttering and opening UI would cause a strange lag for the game.  Seeing water will instantly drop framerate to 20fps on highest setting, and still only mid 50s when setting everything to lowest and looking directly at water surface. 

Given all these problems and the fact that this game had been out for ages in other region, I have very little faith in the developer’s ability to eventually fixing the game.  There are still problems with their UI and real money shop that is overly greedy on top of being buy to play and subscription model, but I care not to look at this game any further or trust that they'd hear the feedback and make it fair.",True,1527677340,1527677340,False,0,0,0.000000,True

Dabei sind die Mascu am interessantesten, weil man hier auch seinen Char als Maus, Hase etc. erstellen kann. 

Auch das nicht alle Rassen jede Klasse Spielen können ist mal was erfrischendes. So können zum Beispiel die Sylvan Elfen (Hieron) und die Aqua Elf (Union) nicht als Berserker fungieren.

So, I've been itching for a new MMO for a while now. I saw videos of Bless a while back, and about 12 hours ago realized it was out thanks to a LazyPeon video. In said video, Peon bashes the game for optimization and such. I was discouraged at first ... but I bought the game ...

And I am having an incredible experience. Granted my hardware is on the higher end side, so I don't really feel much in terms of the bad optimization so I don't have much to say about that, but so far this game has earned its 40$+15$USD.

Ok , before i start this review , let me just clarify 1 thing . im not trying to bash this game to mush but this is just purely honest opinion.

Pro's : - 

- The Game is Fun and enjoyable
- The combat style is new and a small amount of time to get use to
- The graphics is Good , i'd rate it 8/10
- The story is ???? << i dont really care tbh XD
- The latency is decent since im from S.E.A and the client pointed out that it would be 210Ms If i were to play in EU and 250Ms in NA , but tbh the delay isnt that noticable 

Cons : -

- It's and early access which is way to early for its release
- The poor optimization is unberable , it took 5-10 minute for me just to let the game fully rendered before i can move without the fps dropping to 10-15fps
- The game still runs on Dx9 
- Premium pack CANNOT be use Crossed server Na/Eu
- Keybinding is limited so if you have like 20 hotkeys on your mouse , forget about binding it
- The chat censorship is just hilarious 

The way i see it , When the dev fixed the game , a lot of people would enjoy playing it And The FUN part is that , there's no PAY TO WIN crap in the cash shop [ FOR NOW ]

Das Spiel ist derzeit in einem katastrophalen Zustand und sorgt mehr für Frust, als für ein Hype Gefühl, dass ich anfangs hatte.

Ich habe 2 Tage versucht auf die Server zu kommen und habe nur ein einziges mal die Chance gehabt für 10 Minuten Bless zu spielen. Die Mehrheit der Leute kamen nichtmal über den Titelbildschirm hinaus. Alles was an möglichen Tricks aufgezeigt wurde habe ich probiert, jedoch ohne Erfolg. Klar, das Spiel ist gerade im Headstart, dass wäre doch normal...Mit sowas braucht man mir nicht zu kommen. Wir schreiben das Jahr 2018 und sowas sollte in der heutigen Zeit ein No Go sein. 
Andere Spiele haben gezeigt, dass ein Headstart auch ohne große Probleme von statten gehen kann. Also wozu nochmal 39€ zahlen wenn man die beiden Headstart Tage eh nicht spielen kann.

Ein weiterer Kritikpunkt ist die Dreistigkeit, dass versprochen wurde es würde mit einer deutschen Lokalisierung released werden. Bis auf deutsche Untertitel in den dürftigen Videosequenzen war aber nichts auf deutsch, was bei vielen für Frust gesorgt hat, da man die Quests nicht vollständig verstehen konnte. Die deutsche Übersetzung wurde nun für August angekündigt.
Steam strich also den Punkt unter Sprache und Oberfläche.

[list]
   [*]Game is plagued by it's poor performance on the Unreal Engine 3. Personally, I didn't have any problems running the game, but I definitely expected more out of it in terms of graphics. My 1080ti, and I7-7700k were working their asses off for essientially nothing. I would compare these graphics to Lineage 2, and thats a mobile game.
   [*]Servers are constantly down, whether it be it crashed, or is for maintenace. I didn't expect it's launch to go flawless. Many games have issues upon release, take the recent example of Sea of Theives. The developers did nothing to prepare, something similar to Sea of Theives' Stress Tests and Betas could have helped them prepare for the worst. But, for the players who bought the founder's packs to get the game 2 days early, it was essientially useless. Those 2 days were nothing but servers being down, crashes, and launch bugs. 
   [*]And finally the deal breaker, the game in general. The combat system is beyond bad, and feels so static. You sit there simply hitting the enemy, with extremely simple combos, as dodge is for the most part non-existent in the game. The camera is terrible, with no means of adjusting it, it was extremely rough. The story lacked everything. Honestly, for the hours I played, i simply spammed F to get through the dialouge, since it was so bad. The cutscenes are a joke, the audio doesnt even cue sometimes, and so youre just there looking at a silent cutscene reading subtitles. 

The game has numerous issues. I was so excited for it, and was in denial for the first few hours because I wanted a new MMORPG so bad. I just learned that the game has been the exact same for the past 5 or so years, being released in different regions. If they havent realized their issues in the past, I doubt they would change even now.

So with that, I would recommend pretty much any other MMORPG aside from this. Games like Black Desert Online, or what I was just recommended Guild Wars 2, are much better. For games like these, Im always looking for new friends to play with so feel free to add me, and ill be streaming my new experience on GW2 at twitch.tv/blanktv_ , so come join and hang out.

0,135,26,745,745,76561197988768634,0,polish,False,42380115,"Witam. Z jednej strony interesuje się tym tytułem od początku, z drugiej jednak nie mam obsesji na jego punkcie, dlatego postaram się być obiektywny. Odczucia są dość ambiwalentne, trochę jak z teściową spadającą w przepaść – niby spada, ale jednak w naszym najnowszym Porshe ;)
 Zacznijmy od początku, który jest raczej kiepski. Niestety gra miała fatalny start. Większość negatywnych opinii nie dotyczy gry, a serwerów, problemów z uruchomieniem itd. Dla mnie jest to niezrozumiałe, ponieważ jaki sens ma ocena gry, której się nawet nie uruchomiło? To jak wejść do salonu samochodowego, podejść do auta, pociągnąć za klamkę w drzwiach – „O! Zamknięte!” i wystawić negatywny komentarz dla samochodu za całokształt, włącznie z prowadzeniem, bo podejście do sprzedawcy po kluczyk przekroczyło intelektualne możliwości kilku idiotów. Już tłumaczę dlaczego. Wiele osób nie uruchomiło gry, ponieważ miało gfreez screen z logo Bless na początku. Oczywiście wystarczyło wejść na forum Steam, czy oficjalnej strony Bless, czy nawet wygooglować sobie rozwiązanie. Ale po co? Lepiej walnąć negatywa, który świadczy tylko o nieudolności. Na końcu napiszę co zrobić, aby ograniczyć problem z freez screen’em.
Jeśli chodzi o wydawcę gry, to możemy mówić o niedostatecznym przygotowaniu do premiery, ale czy na pewno? Założeniem było uruchomienie jednego serwera EU, a w ciągu kilku godzin uruchomiono aż cztery. Taka sama sytuacja dotyczy NA, czyli ostatecznie zamiast 2 mamy 8 serwerów. To jednak spore zaplecze. Niestety zainteresowanie jest tak wielkie, że i to nie wystarczyło. Dodatkowo zbyt późno zablokowano dodawanie nowych postaci do serwerów, co wywołało kolejki po kilkaset, a czasami nawet w tysiącach osób. Ponadto obiecano jeden mega-serwer, dlatego ludzie mają za złe to, że nie mogą dołączyć do swoich przyjaciół przez te właśnie blokady. Zmiana serwera też nie jest dobrym pomysłem, bo część rzeczy z Founder Packa niestety jest przypisana do postaci (podobno mają to zmienić, ale możliwe, że to tylko plotka) i po przejściu na nowy serwer, żeby uniknąć kolejek, po prostu nie otrzymamy tych bonusów.
Jeśli chodzi o grę, mogę śmiało powiedzieć, że jest dobra. Nie powiem, że jest genialna, ponieważ system walki, choć poprawiony, to jednak pozostawia wiele do życzenia. Grafika jest bardzo ładna, jednak na kolana nie powala. Kiedy gra wyszła kilka lat temu w Korei, może dupę urywała (pod względem grafiki), niestety od tego czasu mieliśmy premiery Black Desert, czy Revelation online i taka grafika nie jest już dla nas tym przysłowiowym „next-genem”. Lokacje dopracowano pod Europejskie standardy, ponieważ miasta czy wioski faktycznie przywołują na myśl średniowiecze z książek fantasy. Jednak pomiędzy tymi pięknymi lokacjami, czy spotami typowo pod farmienie, przestrzeń jest dość pusta. Nie jest brzydka, jednak uboga. Zwłaszcza na pierwszym biomie, który powinien nas zachęcać do gry, a nie odstraszać. Poza tym, nie można się raczej przyczepić do niczego. Dźwięk w grze bardzo przyjemny, muzyka klimatyczna, ale w końcu to Hans Zimmer, więc czego się spodziewać ;) Rozgrywka wciągająca i dość rozbudowana. System mountów/petów jest na pewno mocną stroną tej gry. Ja osobiście nie odczułem kompana jako jakiegoś pomocnika, po prostu jest, ale też nie zaszedłem w grze do end game’u, więc nie mogę określić jak to wygląda później. Mam nadzieję, że kompani jednak dają nam spory bonus siły. Questy, jeśli chodzi o główną linię fabularną, to są ciekawe, przerywane animowanymi wstawkami, trochę jak to jest np. w FF XIV. Side questy to już zupełnie inna historia. Tu mamy do czynienia z typowymi dla MMO RPG: przynieś, podnieś, pozamiataj. Czasami lekką przesadą jest, kiedy musimy podać NPC’owi coś, co leży metr od niego, bo dupy mu się nie chcę ruszyć, czy przyprowadzić kozę stojącą obok! ;) Ale taki urok tego typu gier. Wymagamy nie wiadomo czego, jednak musimy pamiętać, że mechanika MMO RPG opiera się głównie na walce, pozostała część to zbieractwo, crafting i rozmawianie z npc i na tym opierają się questy. Zadania tworzy się pod mechanikę gry, a nie odwrotnie. Ja osobiście wolałbym jednak mniej questów pobocznych, ale w stylu głównego wątku z animacjami i wciągającą historią, niż mnóstwo pierdołowatych zadań na przynoszenie czegoś. Wracając do walki. Opiszę na przykładzie Berserka, bo tą klasę znam najlepiej. Niestety zróżnicowanie sklli w moim odczuciu nie daje nic. W zasadzie wybieracie ten, który daje największy DMG i ciągle go używacie w kombo (kombinacja 3 ciosów – teoretycznie 3 różnych skilli). Jeśli ma zbyt długi cool down, dobieracie drugi, z krótszym czasem ładowania i to samo – 3 skille w combo. Na tym się kończą skille. Choć mamy tyle możliwości w drzewku skilli, to praktycznie używamy max 3 kombinacji skilli + jakieś skille bufujące czy wspomagające (max 4 dodatkowe). W większości MMO wykorzystujemy pełen wachlarz możliwości, ponieważ daje to różne benefity dla nas, czy debuffy na przeciwnika, co z kolei możemy wyraźnie odczuć w walce. Tu tego nie uświadczymy, lub ma tak znikomy wpływ, że nie ma sensu sobie tym głowy zawracać. Nie wiem jak to wygląda z innymi klasami, bo zaledwie je liznąłem. Drzewko pasywów zupełnie standardowe, ale też nie wyczuwamy zmian zbyt gwałtownie.
Podsumowując, gra jest ok. Z jednej strony dałbym jej 8, może nawet 8,5/10, jednak z powodu systemu walki nie mogę ocenić na więcej jak 7/10. Taką też pozostawiam ostateczną ocenę w mojej opinii. Gra nie zawojuje rynku MMO, nie zamiecie pod dywan innych tytułów, jednak wydaje mi się, że zostanie z nami na długi czas. Za wcześnie mówić jak długo, ponieważ to zależy od end game’u. Czuje niedosyt, ale jednak bawię się dobrze.
Zapomniałem też wspomnieć o ważnym dla niektórych aspekcie – optymalizacji. Gra chodzi dobrze, jeśli nie jesteśmy w mieście czy wiosce, gdzie są co najmniej setki graczy. Tam spadki FPS’ów są znaczne. Jednak teraz mamy wielkie bum na tą grę i takie sytuacje są standardem. W późniejszej rozgrywce, jak wiemy z doświadczenia, takie zapełnione miejsce to główny rynek w mieście gdzie wszystko jest pod ręką i tyle. Ja osobiście poza miastami mogłem grać na ultra i w miarę trzymało jeden poziom FPS. W miastach jednak gdzie są setki graczy, musiałem zmienić ustawienia na wysokie, a kilka detali zmniejszyłem nawet do średnich, aby gra chodziła w pełni płynnie. Tu jednak trzeba podkreślić, że gra na ustawieniach niskich i wysokich nie różni się tak drastycznie, to jest znaczny plus. Jeśli chodzi o komputer na którym gram (bo mówienie o FPS’ach bez podania parametrów komputera mija się z celem) to: i7 6700, 16GB RAM, GTX 1060 6GB i gra zainstalowana na dysku SSD.
Obiecałem powiedzieć, jak ograniczyć problem freez screena, przynajmniej dopóki producenci tego problemu nie usuną:
Freez Screen – Jeśli macie ten  problem, po pierwsze w luncher wejdźcie w opcje gry i ustawicie niską rozdzielczość. Wybieracie ekran 4:3 i np. rozdzielczość 1024/768. To nie usuwa problemu ale mocno go ogranicza. U mnie z kilkunastu uruchomień zmieniło się na 1-3, żeby gra wreszcie wystartowała. Dodatkowo niektórym pomaga uruchamianie gry nie ze skrótu na pulpicie, który odpala lunchera, ale z pliku bezpośrednio w folderze gry, który znajduje się w katalogu steam – odpalamy go jako administrator. Trzeba pamiętać tylko, że musimy mieć odpalonego steama, ponieważ ten plik uruchamia grę także bez steama, ale w takiej sytuacji od razu będziemy mieli disconnect.

Polecam Bless, bo jest po prostu dobry, a obecna posucha na rynku MMO RPG tym bardziej sprawia, że warto go przetestować na własnej skórze. Poczekałbym jednak z zakupem kilka dni, aż sytuacja się ustabilizuje. Pamiętajmy, że mamy do czynienia ze wczesnym dostępem. To nie usprawiedliwia wydawcy, zwłaszcza, że gra śmiga stabilnie od kilku lat w Korei, podobnie ma się japońska wersja. Tym bardziej dziwi nas taki fatalny start w Europie i Ameryce. Pozostaje nam czekać na poprawę, bo biorąc pod uwagę ciągłe przerwy na maintenance, widać przynajmniej, że walczą i robią co mogą ;)

BDO had WAY TOO MUCH crap happening at the same time. It felt so claustrophobic. I did like the fighting, but the quests were rediculous and I did not read any of the text or dialogue at all. I quickly refunded that. I played the free trial for Final Fantasy and I felt it to be too sluggish and boring.  Hardly saw any other players on the game. After playing this game, the quests are actually interesting and I watch all the cut scenes. I actually read the quest text as well because it is voice acted. I do feel it is lacking in back story, but it's okay. I've quite enjoyed the combat system. I am playing a mage class, which I have never played before in MMO's, usually I am a knight or paladin class. I really really like my character.

this whole thing atm is normal, like dc´s or lag inside big citys where lots of ppl run around. Sure the performance is not good i can confirm this, but for me, i have seen way way way worse!

Atm i am at lvl 20 and the performance is kinda ok outside the high pop. areas. 
I would say in citys i average around 30fps with high player count. Outside 70fps up to 100fps. 4k res all up on 1080ti@2ghz and with ryzen 1600@4ghz. Should be alot higher thats for sure.......
I just cant give it a thumbs down because i am having enough fun for that money i paid. Some ppl pay 60€ every year for a new CoD with a reskin to play 3hrs of campain. And they are happy with it and others just hate it to the ground.

Sure i hope they will bring alot of fixes to the performance and even translation (looks rushed) and if not i think i can get around 60hrs without a hustle out of the game. And for that i paid 40€. I am ok with that.....

Jeder der schon lange auf ein gutes MMO gehoft hat, sah in Bless nun mal ein Nordlicht das einen mit Hoffnung füllte, nun aber mal zum Inhalt.

Ich habe seid Letztes Jahr November fleisig mitgefiebert, als Steam bestätigte das Neowiz, die Entwickler, Bless nun selbst nach EU / NA bringen wollen, es dauerte auch nicht lange, dan sind viele Informationen geflossen, mehr über das spiel Selbst, was wir bekommen, was sich ändern wird, worauf wir uns freuen dürfen, dinge die vor allem uns heiß und neugierig auf das Spiel machen sollten. Dann wurde Anfang des Jahres das Emissary System ins leben gerufen, die erste Konferenz startete und viele Fragen und Bedenken stoßten bei vielen auf, es wurde zwar einem die Hand gereicht, jedoch mehr missverständnisse kamen zustande als sie für klärungen sorgten. Nun gut, man war noch gespannter, weil viele dieser Emissary ihre Meinung äußerten, einige recht offen, andere sehr aufgeregt und einige wiederum komplett gefangen von diesen Bezaubernden Spiel. 

Als die Founderpacks bekannt gegeben wurden, war der Shitstorm rießig, viele Inhalte ergaben kein Sinn, die Preise waren eine Zumutung und deren Inhalt verwirrte einige, es wurde zwar einiges Klargestellt, es wurde auch gesagt man sucht eine Lösung, niemand soll 1:1 die gleiche Summe zahlen, doch am ende kam es anders, ich bin eigentlich nicht überrascht, sondern mehr entäuscht, was mich jedoch nicht abhielt die 40€ für die Version auf den Tisch zu legen um einen ersten Eindruck vom spiel zu bekommen, weil ich eigentlich schon mich sehr darauf gefreut habe. Die ersten Stunden verliefen jedoch eher bedrückend, eine Lösung zum starten musste her, nach einigen Anläufen ging es dann durch änderungen im Steam Ordner selbst, zumindest laut der Entwickler sollte es helfen, eine Vorrübergehende Lösung, die leider nicht bei jeden ging, nach Etlichen Neustarts (40 im dreh) war man imstande den Server dann Auszuwählen, nach einer Warteschlange dann die Wahrheit, die Fraktion worauf deine Mitspieler sind, ist gesperrt, gut nochmal, den ersten Tag des EA Headstarts also damit verbracht bis 23:00 Uhr auf den gleichen Server und der gleichen Fraktion zu Spielen. 

Gegen 1 Uhr morgens dann die ersten schritte im Spiel, es lief nicht ganz rund, auf Reddit baten usern einige änderungen mithilfe der Config an, selbst danach war das ganze eher unzufriedenstellend, aber es lief, immerhin befanden sich mehrere mitspieler vor mir, man drück hier da ein Auge zu und beginnt einfach. Die Ersten Schritte im Spiel fühlten sich eher unwohl an, das Tutorial erklärte zwar was zu machen war, jedoch in einem Englisch das irgendwie mehr fragen aufwarf als für Antworten sorgte, vieles verwirrende Klicken sorgte dann für das Vorrankommen, im Spiel dann nach und nach die ersten Quest und Kämpfe erlebt, alles ganz nett, aber es fühlte sich träge an, sehr träge, das neue Kampfsystem mit den Kombos? Umständig, kompliziert, bremste das Gefühl etwas, vor allem da das besagte True Action Combat auf einmal nicht Ingame war, über mehrere fragen Ingame teilten mir Spieler mit, es wurde vorerst entfernt, ist nur für eine Klasse erhältlich und kommt vielleicht später, zu einen nicht genannten Zeitpunkt, zurück. Nun gut, dann verzichten wir einfach darauf und probieren es so.

Eine Ausdauerleiste die mich im Kampf bremste war das erste was mich verwirrte, also eine Aktionsleiste, die sich langsam fühlt, aber für jede Interaktion / Ausführung von Skills im Kampf punkte verbraucht, ungewohnt, die ersten Kämpfe verliefen damit das ich erst einmal ein Gefühl für die Leiste brauchte, da sie oft einfach leer war. Gut zeit zum Lesen gab es dann genug im Skillfenster, da die Autopath funktion einen doch mehr Arbeit abnahm als gedacht.
Das Spiel verlief dann eher wie eine Automatiesierte Abfrage von Interaktionen - laufe nach A - Auto Path - laufe nach B - Auto Path - dabei einfach mal im Chat fragen stellen, Skills durchlesen und vorran kommen, das übliche halt in MMOs.

Die gegenden waren nicht wirklich überrant, man konnte eigentlich zügig Questen, sogar Monster Jagen, doch dann kam nochmal eine Wartung, weil die Server leideten, für mich war der Abend vorbei, am Morgen dann erneut eingelogt, auf die Jagd, rein ins Abenteuer. Einige verbugte Quest, der Loginbildschirm of Doom und zu Stoßzeiten Miese Pings waren alle ertragbar, die schlechte Leistung die mein PC brachte konnte ich auch gut enstecken, immerhin lief es auserhalb von Städten von 30-80 FPS bei Hoher bis Mittlerer Einstellung. Nur das Kampfsystem, das ganze Spiel selbst, das Fehlende Interargieren mit Mitspielern (Trades) und vieles mehr machte es irgendwie mehr Träge als Spaßig, davon Abgesehen das viele der Monster fast One Shots waren mit einer kleinen Skillcombo - der Erste Dungeon mehr Entäuschend als Überraschend wirkte und PvP anscheinend wirklich etwas weiter hinter liegen würde. 

Mit LvL 24 habe ich dann gestern das Spiel beendet und feststellen müssen, es bietet recht wenig von den Versprochenden Sachen, mich ärgert wohl am meisten das Kampfsystem, das drücken von 1 bis 7 mit den Tasten R - T - Y (was ich auf Z gelegt habe). Das Kombo System ist nicht mehr wie eine Rotation aus anderen MMOs, nur verpackt in einer Lustigen Abfrage von Tastendrucks, man Drückt die 1 Und dann einfach brav R - T oder Z, ich dachte vielleicht das man nach dem Drücken von 1 und R - T - Z weiter durchgängig wählen könnte, doch sobald eine Combo gestartet wurde, wiederholt sich diese mit der gleichen Taste, ob sich das Später ändern würde, kann ich nicht herauslesen, zumindest sah es im Skillbaum eher so aus, als würde die Skillreinfolge dann Linear bleiben. Das Wechseln von Stances an sich fand ich recht interessant, blieb aber irgendwie auf der Halben Strecke stehen / liegen, da die Gegner meist einfach mit den simplen Combos schon beseitigt waren, 

So Sehr ich mich bemühe, so sehr ich eigentlich Bless gerne für einen längeren Zeitrum spielen wollte, muss ich bedauerlicherweiße viele der aktuellen Reviews zustimmen, es ist nicht das was man sich vorgestellt hat, sicherlich sind viele zufrieden und freuen sich sehr das es nun da ist, ich wünsche auch diesen Viel Spaß damit, nur für mich fühlt sich das ganze nicht an, als wäre es das, worauf ich mich gefreut habe, ganz im Gegenteil, ich bin eigentlich entäuscht, nicht wegen den Problemen die es mit sich brachte, dafür habe ich schon verständniss, nur es wirkt Halbherzig auf den Makrt geworfen, ohne sich vorher gedanken zu machen, vor allem mit den fehlenden Action Kampfsystem, worauf ich mich eigentlich am meisten gefreut habe, da es hierzu aber leider kaum eine Klare Information gibt wann es dann doch seine Wege zu uns findet wird (bis auf der Berserker, wurde es bei allen Deaktiviert).

Diese Kleinigkeiten am Ende sorgen dafür das mir das Spiel selbst kein Spaß macht, egal wie sehr ich es auch versuche, ich bin unzufrieden mit den Spielgefühl. Zum Schluss kann ich nur sagen, für mich war es eines der MMOs auf die ich mich gefreut habe, aber leider nicht die Ansprüche erfüllt hat, es nicht meiner Vorstellung gerecht wurde. Sollte euch das Spiel zusagen, nur zu, Genießt es in vollen Zügen. Niemand möchte es euch madig reden, nur finde ich, sollte man dann auch verstehen, das es nicht jedermans Herz mit wärme füllt, sondern aktuell auch mit Entäuschung.

Soviel dazu von mir, wer weiß, vielleicht ändert sich doch noch einiges und man sieht sich Ingame, doch Aktuell? Wohl eher weniger. Wer sich zu der Review äußern möchte, kann dies doch direkt Privat machen, ich bin kein Freund von Kommentarschlachten, die diese Review nicht Gutheißen weil Baum :P

Pros:

- Quick levelling
- Creature capture system means massive variety of mounts and passive buffs
- Chaining system on ranged classes doesn't [i]completely[/i] penalise Oceanic players for bad latency

Cons:
- Pointless censorship (content relevant to the story has been cut, which throws the plot off quite a bit)
- Horrendous subs/voice acting
- Bait-and-switch on the combat system (that revamped combat system they pushed as the main selling point of the game is only in for one class)
- RNG-gated rune improvement, pet/mount improvement
- Missing content (I've yet to reach a level where this is an issue, but we're capped at level 45 and apparently missing quite a bit of the endgame)

And of course, most importantly: The devs are following the trend a lot of really bad developers have in not communicating with their playerbase, attempting to shut down criticism instead of answering it and establishing communication channels with their community, and stonewalling pretty much any and all support requests related to their pre-release purchases. This lack of communication was evident in some of our other, classic launch flops - Aion, Archeage, etc - and in a lot of respects, Neowiz isn't really doing anything different from those who've failed before. Consistent efforts are being made to patch launch issues - something I haven't seen in a KMMO release before - but the most notable piece of work that's hit since launch was a heavy-handed damage nerf that renders the midgame dungeon content impassable for a group that's not overgeared for it and completely screwed the levelling grind for anyone not already at the cap. While points can be awarded for effort, they're outweighed by those deducted for a simple lack of common sense in some areas.

Vous allez me dire, pourquoi je recommande le jeu ? Et bien, je ne le recommande pas forcément mais personnellement, je m'amuse bien sur Bless Online malgré les soucis, j'aime bien le gameplay qui pour moi, se rapproche plus proche d'un GW2 que d'un Tera, je pense que ceux qui sont déçus à cause de ça n'ont simplement pas choisis le bon jeu ou ils n'ont pas eu les bonnes infos. 

Ceux qui se plaignent que le jeu n'est pas en français, les devs n'ont jamais dit qu'il allait l'être mais par contre oui, la traduction anglaise est parfois un peu bancale mais après ça reste un mmorpg, les objectifs sont clairement indiqués et il n'y a rien d'insurmontable, à aucun moment je me suis retrouvé coincé alors que je suis loin de savoir lire correctement l'anglais. 

Le jeu est vendu en buy to play et il est en accès anticipé, il y a donc des bugs et des problèmes, c'est même marqué en gros et en gras avant de l'acheter, donc dans ces conditions chacun est responsable de son achat et mettre des avis négatifs en rapport à ça n'a aucun sens. 

Clairement Bless Online ne sera pas un WOW-KILLER, il ne sera pas le meilleur mmorpg du monde mais il reste agréable à parcourir, le gameplay sans rien révolutionner se laisse prendre en main, l'abo premium est pour le moment très clean et n'est donc pas pay to win, le cash shop n'est pas plus avantageux que dans d'autres jeux comme TESO et on est pour le moment très loin d'un BDO et du coup, ça me donne vraiment envie de soutenir les développeurs pour qu'ils puissent maintenir dans les mois à venir une qualité de jeu que d'aller les défoncer pour rien.

0,22,2,5588,5588,76561198005751730,0,french,False,42379847,"Bon... je vais tenter après environ 91h de jeu de donner mon avis.

Personnellement, l'histoire d'un jeu ne m'accroche que très peu, à l'exception de certaines comme GuildWars 2 par exemple. Mais ici, je n'ai même pas senti un semblant d'histoire, ni même un seul élément permettant de donner envie aux joueurs de la connaître. La barrière de la langue est évident contraignante pour beaucoup.

Le gameplay de Bless Online est orienté combos. Autrement dit, vous devrez effectuer divers enchainements (jusqu'à 7), vous permettant de taper progressivement plus fort. Bien que sympathique, je suis bien plus friand d'une totale liberté quant aux choix des compétences à utiliser, surtout en fonction des situations. Dans mon cas (mage level 45), j'ai trouvé ce système très restrictif, limité, et j'avoue que j'aurais apprécié un système de macros permettant une optimisation des combos plutôt que devoir m'acheter une 3ème main.

Les déplacements sont tout à fait classiques, rien d'innovant, aucune esquive si ce n'est éventuellement une compétence active que vous pouvez avoir, bref, absolument rien de percutant.

J'ai personnellement trouvé le lancement des sorts particulièrements lents, non pas à cause des CD ou du temps de cast, mais je parle de la réactivité du jeu à comprendre qu'on veut lancer un sort permettant de se protéger d'une AoE infligeant 94723 dégâts...

Malheureusement, en plus de ces ""défauts"", il existe une multitude de bugs qui n'auraient jamais dû exister, même pour une Early Access :
- Des hitbox d'AoE complètement insane (être à LITTÉRALEMENT 10 pas d'une AoE et en subir les dégâts, désolé mais non)
- Des WorldBoss ne donnant aucun XP, aucun loot.
- Des zones où les textures ne sont pas appliquées, vous faisant tomber dans un vide infini
- Les runes qui explosent obligatoirement à votre mort (je suis runiste, et je pleure encore)

Et j'en passe...

Aussi, le nerf global des dégâts appliqués par les devs empêche d'effectuer convenablement les donjons HL (Migra Turris et  Patala Ruins) voire de ne pas pouvoir les faire. 

Visuellement, le jeu est ""correct"", il ne casse pas trois pattes à un co***rd mais il ne vous fait pas pleurer du sang.

Enfin, certaines fonctionnalités manquent cruellement. On citera par exemple le fait qu'il soit IMPOSSIBLE et qu'il ne sera JAMAIS POSSIBLE de faire du trading avec les autres joueurs...

Je ne peux malheureusement donner de positif que le système de montures / pets obtenables à la capture, et le fait que les dévs réagissent très rapidement et travaillent dur pour améliorer leur jeu. 

En résumé, je déconseille très fortement Bless Online, qui, bien qu'il soit sympathique en théorie, reste très, TRES en dessous de mes attentes personnelles, bien que je n'espérais rien. 

Si je devais noter ce jeu, il vaudrait autant de points que de côtés positifs pour moi, c'est à dire : 2 / 10.

Resümee 
~~~~~~~

Der Hypetrain ist entgleist und aufs Gleisbett gestürzt. Die Frage ist, ob man ihn wieder auf die Schiene bringt oder ob der Schaden irreparabel ist. Hier ein Einblick in die Problematik, die es aktuell aus meiner Sicht gibt:

Lokalisierung
Abgesehen davon, dass es anders als angekündigt, kein deutsches UI gibt, ist die englische Lokalisierung sehr schlecht. Teilweise ergeben die Quests keinen Sinn und noch schlimmer, sind die Skill Beschreibungen unverständlich oder sogar falsch. Ein und derselbe Skill hat in unterschiedlichen Tooltipps verschiedene Namen. Das führ öfters zu Verwirrungen.

Balancen
Das Balancing stimmt zurzeit nicht. Dort müssen sie dringend etwas anpacken. Mein Paladin ist absolut overtuned. Ich kann es locker mit 3 Spielern gleichzeitig aufnehmen, es sei denn einer ist auch Pala. Der Jäger ist mit Abstand der schwächste während der Mage nur aus der Taste 2 bestehst. Das ist auch keine Übertreibung. Er besteht tatsächlich nur aus der Tastenfolge 22222222222[...] und vielleicht der Blink. Damit töte ich in der Regel alles außer dem Pala. Ich schätze hier kommen bald die ersten Änderungen.
 
Endgame
Das Endgame ist schnell beschrieben, da es keines gibt. Das sage nicht nur ich, sondern auch die Entwickler, die sich bereits dafür entschuldigt haben. Das verstehe ich allerdings nicht, da sie 2,5 Jahre Zeit hatten, das zu ändern. Was genau haben sie eigentlich in der Zeit gemacht, außer geringfügig das Kampfsystem anzupassen? Es gibt 2 Dungeons die man 1x am Tag erledigen könnte, theoretisch. Aber die meisten Leute schaffen es nicht mehr, nach dem Damage Debuff. Und sollten sie es doch schaffen, gehen sie in der Regel leer aus. Die Dropchance im Dungen liegt bei 3%. 3% die sich unter den 5 Mitgliedern aufteilt. Im PVP gibt es nur die BGs. Diese finden allerdings nur zu bestimmten Zeiten statt und insgesamt 3x am Tag. Durchschnittliche Spieler können also 1x am Tag am BG teilnehmen - wenn, ja wenn sie reinkommen. Meistens dauert es ewig bis sich eins öffnet, auf unserem Server zumindest. Und wenn es aufgeht, darf man gerade nicht auf der Reise sein, da man sonst nicht rein kann. Der Rest des Endgames besteht draus stundenlang Hunting Quests zu machen, also Monster zu töten und zusammen mit 100 anderen Champions zu Farmen, in der Hoffnung, ihn zuerst anzuschießen. 


Technische Probleme
Die Performance ist weiterhin nicht gut. Laggs, FPS Drops, Frezz beim Öffnen von Fenstern und so weiter sind noch nicht behoben. Die Engine ist von 2004 und stößt langsam auf ihre Grenzen. Es werden nicht alle Formate nativ unterstützt. Wer 21:9 hat, hat Pech. Hohe Auflösungen haben dieselben Schwierigkeiten. Keybindings für die Maus funktionieren nicht. Fenster können nicht skaliert werden und so weiter. Die Liste ist endlos. Es wirkt, als wäre Bless Online das erste MMO überhaupt oder hätte die letzten 14 Jahre Entwicklung einfach verschlafen. Grundlegende Spielefunktionen wie zB Keybinding fehlen einfach. Das Spiel nutzt nur ein CPU Kern. Ich schreibe an dieser Stelle nicht weiter.

Und nun die kurze Liste was mir gefällt

Taming
Da man quasi (fast) jeden Mob tamen kann, ist für jeden etwas dabei. Entweder als Mount oder als Pet. Das macht tatsächlich spaß. 



Fazit
~~~~

Ich würde tatsächlich von einem Kauf abraten. Für den Augenblick. Sobald sich herausstellt ob gravierende Probleme behoben werden (können), kann man bestimmt zuschlagen ohne es später zu bereuen. Nach dem ersten Eindruck ist das Spiel jedoch eher etwas für Enthusiasten oder Spielern, die nicht wissen was sie sonst spielen sollen und sie davon nicht gestört sind, dass grundlegende Funktionen, die man im Jahr 2018 erwartet, schlicht nicht existieren.

Wer sich selbst ein Bild machen möchte, kann in meinem Twitch Kanal vorbeischauen. Dort kann er unsere Gilde beim Zocken beobachten und schauen ob das Spiel etwas für ihn ist oder nicht.

*The game is in Early Access right now and currently:

Has loading / hanging issues -- These are already being addressed / have been fixed.
Has framerate / optimization issues
Has balance issues
Has content missing
Has very poor localization
Has hundreds of people who expected a polished official release and are now having a mass mental breakdown.*

Let's be honest from the start: NeoWiz most likely pushed forward an early access version of the game so they could get the necessary funding to continue proper development. The game is not in it's final state nor will stay this way indefinitely. They stated early in the founders pack details that this would be an early access game, and that you were getting head start to early access.

Bugs suck, instability sucks. Nobody likes these things. I don't like these things. I want them to finish the game as fast as possible as well, who wouldn't? Trust me. The first thing I wanted to do after being kicked from the game and sent into a 3096 player queue (twice in 4+ hours) was write an angry review and get a refund. I soon realized that this behaviour will not aid in the improvement of the game. Improvements that will come out of the Early Access stage.

Now that we have that out of the way -- I can see potential in Bless NA.

Will the game ever be a turbo-optimized, 100+ fps AAA quality beast with NASA servers? Doubt it. Can it be vastly improved from it's current state? I'd wager it can given a fair chance and some time. 

Here's a few positive things about the game in it's current state:

The new combat is a lot of fun and I must say it is currently the most enjoyable part of the game for me. It's not perfect but it's kept my attention thus far.

The game world is beautiful for it's engine. They have done a great job fidelity wise.

Level progression feels relatively painless, and is quick to complete.

Closing Notes:

This game will not be and is not for everyone.

Bless won't be the worlds most revolutionary MMO nor the most popular however if given a fair chance it's likely that reasonable expectations will be met.

Should you buy it right now then? Only if you are interested in helping the game grow with constructive feedback, and lots of trial and error.

If not, I'd recommend not following the hype nor the hate trains to any destination. Keep watch over the game and make an informed decision once improvements are (or are not) made.

Aber der Start und das nachschieben von Servern ging so glatt von der Bühne dass wir die erste Nacht bis 3 Uhr ohne Problem zocken konnten. Am zweiten Tag kam es dann für viele Stunden zu einem Server Problem, doch auch darum wurde sich (wenn auch spät und mit wenig Kommunikation) gekümmert, so dass wir die ganze Nacht wieder ohne Probleme , laggs , Input laggs oder sonstigem zocken konnten.

Und da es hier um das Spiel und nicht um irgend welche kindischen ""ich kann nicht zocken deswegen Flame ich Bewertungen"" geht, hier eine Zusammenfassung meinerseits:

+ Tolle Grafik
+ Für EU Spieler extrem flüssig 
+ ein Kampfsystem dass es so in einem MMO-rpg noch nicht gab und anfangs extrem fordernd ist.
+ Super gelungenes taming system
+ Bisher kein bisschen p2w

Ich bin kein fanboy oder so aber man sollte einfach realistisch bleiben bevor man hier eine negative Review schreibt. Immerhin sind über 30k Spieler online und genießen das Spiel.

Why do i say this? After tweaks to the INI file, the game is running smoothly for me on a GTX970M. Apart from that 'Splashscreen' bug, where you had to kill the application and retry probably several times if u're not lucky, to start the game, oh, and some hanging buildings in the distance, then this is basically all that bugs the game now. Honestly, other than that '1 Level' thing people mentioned, I don't see any glaring translation hiccups (I'm pretty prolific in English).

Combat is pretty enjoyable, it is new, faster than the regular FFXIV type, but not too slow compared to Black Desert Online BDO.

It's like a brand new world to explore and it's definitely not boring. That's why people who are downvoting the game, said they actually enjoy it.

Basically this is all with regards to launch day(s) headaches people are getting these two days (more for the rest of the guys, less for me).

- Opening the game, since is the first time i dont notice at first sight that the game is frozen, but it actually is.

- 2 servers available, one full, the second day they added 2 full servers more.

- Queues are about 1000 players long, my experience playing rift says thats not less than 2 hours.

- Character screen, interesting, not the best but the caracters is very customizable, tits and butt sliders, body form.

- Ingame, nice... with my brand new HP Omen, i still get a poor performance, 150 developers and they cant find a good one in game performance... just terrible.

- First mission, with the paladin, the translation looks made by two different translation engines, the first objective is called different in the quest text than in the UI. Leaving aside the translation and grammar errors in only a single line of quest text.

- Some missions were bugged, like the one i tried with the little doggos race. Emptied the ship of the bettles, the objective does not checks, im stuck. (restart, restart again, queue, play)

Next try with the mission, i kill the bugs, and the big one appears, it is not dying and keeps chasing me with 0HP, i die, retry and die again.

- I disconnect again and restart a couple of times, take a look at the queue but i cant see the end, so i close, and asked for refund. to have the game buried in the deepest of the steam shop shelves to not be opened anymore by anyone. 
I was going to waste 40€ and my precious time in this. Good thing i had quick reaction.

The game is great. I like the feel, I like how smooth the combat can be, and it has so much potential to be a game changer. I love the character design of the Mascu, they're adorable and I love being a Small character Flailing an Axe around, I wouldn't usually ask for anything more, However, in this instance, It'll take more than a Super Kawaii desu ne character to keep me from losing my mind, which pulls me onto the negatives at hand.

As every other negative review here, I understand the launch of an MMO can be unstable, Especially with Early Access, so I can appreciate there will be bugs here and there, the game is still being refined and we have to appreciate that (Suffering through FFXIV since before ARR has taught me this, especially with regards to the launch of Stormblood, but I digress).

The main negative point for me, Optimisation. The game is not new, it has been around for a long time, there has been plenty of oppertunity to fix this prior to release. With regards to optimisation on the NA/EU version, nothing has changed, if not been made worse, the frame rate... sweet baby jesus, even after various fixes, would manage to get below 30 and stutter more than Jimmy from South Park, again, I digress. I played a while on the JP server to try this game out, and it ran much smoother than this, as I was exploring the world, parts of the land were missing, I could see other players walking on the parts that were missing, floating in the sky next to my quest objective, but I would just fall into the endless abyss, greeted by a message that would tell me I have gone too far out and must recall, only to continue falling through the floor upon doing so, and using the 'unstuck' function. as I was falling, I could see alot of the leftover parts that had been unused when making the game, such as textures and unfinished airships that were static and untextured etc.

Point number two: The Splash screen of death. Logging in 15 times to be greeted by an endless splash screen before finally being successful in selecting my character isn't what I expected over half of my gameplay time to be doing, I payed the extra for 2 days early access to the game, not 2 days of bug reporting before I can even get onto the game, and despite best efforts to fix said bugs with maintainance that was dished out when I finally did manage to log into the game, proceeded to fail yet again, meaning I was back to square one and logging in all over again to no avail, neato.

Not going to even touch the pricing stuff, VAT is VAT, And I recieved my refund in less than 2 hours.

I'll wrap this up with a general once over, This game has the potential to be something great, something that people want and need in an MMO, but until the game is refined, optimised and all around cleaned up, I'd avoid purchasing it. you will be dissapointed, frustrated and baffled by some of the things you may or may not see.

Should the game enter a state where it is playable in the future, I'll consider changing my review to reflect this, until then, it is what it is.",True,1527671231,1527671231,False,25,389,0.809877,True

Optimization is ass, tho there's a reddit guide that helps with that. I personally don't have issues but my computer specs are way above average, so I guess I'm brute forcing my way toward silky smooth 60 fps.

Server lag is bad during peak hours. Hopefuly that's fixed soon (should fix itself with all the people that are about to leave).

So, why recommended? I enjoy the game quite a lot. [b]This is just my own very subjective opinion on the game, it's not an objective & methodical review of each feature.[/b] Combat isn't anything to write home about though it's serviceable and way better than something like ESO. However the world building, the exploration, the progression, the stuff to do... all the little things that matter to me in a mmorpg, are there and they work quite well in my opinion. I love some of the more ""hardcore"" stuff we don't really find anymore in modern mmorpgs. Like, no fast travel you gotta pay for NPC manned transport or just walk/ride to your destination (no loading screen at all, no invisible walls either). There's also PvP I'm looking forward to. Sadly beside a bunch of duels, I haven't had a chance yet to look into RvR. Hopefuly it's not an unbalanced mess. Anyway, so far I'm enjoying the game and if you can look past launch lags and bad optimization that can be sorta fixed by reading a guise, it's not a bad mmorpg to sink your teeth into. You don't have to commit your life to it, but it's imo going to be a nice journey of a few months until the next major mmo thing happens (WoW vanilla?).

The game has never been unplayable or have I experienced an extreme amount of lag despite this issue. This game is fun to play, leveling has been very enjoyable and the difficulty seems set at the right level to be enjoyable and interesting.

* 1 week update, with what I originally  thought was a fun game the developers decided to make huge sweeping changes to the game making the game  unplayable by some and unfun for the rest.

The developers pretend to listen to the players then continue to do whatever they want driving more people away with bad decision after bad decision. If I could still get a refund I would.

The World of Bless is beautiful and vibrant, the Combat is excellent. the graphics attractive,the loading screens are filled with amazing concept art, the musical score is worthy of any epic movie, the character creator second only to black desert online, the combat system is both familiar and different, Well known tab targeting merged with a chain attack focus, allowing attacks to link together in amazing ways, soon Action combat will be introduced for all classes alongside the tab targeting option.

Currently you are forced to edit ini files to get the best performance from the game engine, the login server is also entirely overwhelmed, often it takes 10+ restarts to get into the que, these aspects however are to be expected for an early access game.

[h1]Can you say that again, and in Engish please?.[/h1]

Due to a oversight the tutorial was not fully translated from korean and its frankly hysterical, almost every skill has the wrong name, which takes bait of guess work to figure what they actually what you to do, from concentration renamed as ""focus"" and the occasional odd use of word poison despite not having a skill with a name remotely close (interrupt was the word they actually meant to say), from clumsy sounding dialogue to confusing instructions the tutorial is comically bad, thankfully the main game has far better (not perfect) dialogue and voice acting.

[h1]Learn from history and bite your tongue..[/h1]

Every Mmo launches bad, its a fact and one that slaty players and trolls wont accept, if wow vanilla launched today it would be deemed ""scam, dead, fail"" its launch was one of the worst in history, and yet World of Warcraft is the undisputed most played mmo in the world with millions of subscribers, Final Fantasy 14,Guild Wars 2,ESO, SWTOR, LOTRO, BDO all had horrific launches, and yet have endured for years, with massive(ESO, GW2 FF14) down to moderate(SWTOR,LOTRO, BDO) playerbases.

[h1]But but but I want it Now!.[/h1]

Patience, most buyers of this game are adults, things take time if you want them done right, yes you may want every class and raid ready by early access start, but it wont be, it shouldnt be, and its good they are not in, balance what they have, and then add onto it is the best policy.

[h1]Lol Ded Gaem?.[/h1]

Everyone and their pet dog knows Bless was launched in a radically different form once before and failed, Fortnite the current most played game in the world with 70 million players began as a Horror themed PVE only game announced in 2011, the base of the Fortnite we know now didnt even start to take form till 2016, prior to then it was a very different game, the Battle Royale mode which has captured the world attention only began developement in 2017!

So no THIS iteration of bless is not 7 years old, THIS iteration of Bless has not failed in 3 countries, THIS iteration of bless should be given a chance to fail or succeed on it own merits.

[h1]No pay to win.[/h1]

Unlike many PVP MMO, this game features zero P2W items, something people should support enmasse to make sure we never again have a P2W heavy MMORPG launch in the west, Devs who avoid P2W should be supported, not jumped on for expected MMO launch day woes.

[h1]Worth a Purchase?.[/h1]

Is it for everyone? no, Its for mature gamers who understand the concept of early access, MMO launches and Scam doesn't mean ""but they removed the topless busty elf"", for players who are not entitled and actually wish ti treat a game fairly on its merits then yes its worth a purchase.

Pro:
+ It is free! You only have to pay 30€ and thats it. You don't need to pay monthly. The items you will receive in the premium membership are only skins, pets, etc. 
+ it is not a grinder. you can quest to endlevel. There is no part of the game, where you really have to stay for hours and slay every mob you find.
+ you have a hugh skill-tree
+ you have a minimum prize, when you want to sell something. so for gold-buyers etc. it is harder 

Negative:
- a few options for auto-looting, etc. like in other mmos which are very useful are missing here
- server issues: for now, the servers gone really bad in the afternoon
- unreal engine 3: they decided not to use ue4 because of the costs and the time. But i think, with this, we would have much more performance
- social is missing: this game seems to be more like just a fighting-mmo. there is nearly nothing for calm down. sit with friends. do some roleplay...

You just have to think, that this is early access. most of the issues, bugs will be fixed. But you have to let the players play the game to find them. that is normal. Also you have to think, that this game is not made for 10 years. this is just a nice small mmo for less money, where you and your friends can play for 200-500 hours at this time.

I want to first address a shady business, 150$ packs are not being refunded because you receive multiple copies of the game you could sell. Selling the copies to then refund the game is sadly a valid business model for some bad people. Say thank you to them, don't blame Neowiz or Steam for that matter. 

Anyhow, back to the game. I think Neowiz has not really understood what early access means. It's not a literal early access to a finished game you can monetize before you open it up to everyone. The idea behind early access is to fund game development like a crowdfunding campaign, only that you have some software you can play and work with to give some valuable feedback. DON'T expect this from Bless buying into it. It's pretty much in a state as it will always be. I personally hope for optimization but I don't count on it.

Now why do I still give a positive review? Because i'm not an asshole. Bless is in its core an incredibly well made game. It's not a cheap rip off or cash grab. It is being published by the developers themselves so they not only have to work on the game but manage everything around it as well.

Bless is NOT a revelation but has a real open world where you can run around and find mobs to kill. You don't just run from dungeon to dungeon for the dailies where the ""open world"" is just a way to slow down the process. The open world has a purpose beyond immersion. The main endgame is PvP from what I can tell so don't expect to farm in the open world without getting killed on higher levels. There are factions and some hunting grounds overlap. 

No it's not pay to win. Some people claim the game is pay to win because you can get xp boosters in the cash shop but that's b.s. Pay to win is when you can buy potions that make you stronger in PvP. Where paying customers are always stronger than none paying ones. It's not the case in bless. Yes, you can be stronger if you progress faster but comon.. someone who joins the game in a month from now will also be much weaker than someone who started today. Is that unfair and should we change the game to accomodate for it? No please not.

You will not rule Bless if you can't play 8 hours a day or more just deal with it. If you want PvP where only your skill matters play MOBAs or Battle Royales. MMORPGs are about character progression. You progress and grow. The journey is your goal. 

I will probably buy a regular early access copy of the game today despite having refunded the founder's pack. Just after I refunded it I watched a lot of streamers playing it and.. well I never did that. I think I really want to play it but was extremely angry I couldn't due to all the server issues and fps drops ontop of missing polish.

Man hat Quests, Dungeons, PVP, kann mit Freunden und Gilden zusammen spielen, Taming und Crafting.

Das Taming System ist gut gemacht, jeder kann hier mitmachen und man benötigt keine aussergewöhnlichen Skills dafür. Dass die Server nicht stetig seit Anfang so gelaufen sind wie viele Leute dies erwartet haben ist für mich keineswegs ein negativ Punkt - das Spiel hat im Early Access gestartet - nicht direkt als ""perfekte Endversion"". Neowiz ist hier auch stetig daran diese Probleme so schnell wie möglich zu beheben. Das einzige was mir bisher im Kampf fehlt - kein Autoattack? Oder hab ich das nur noch nicht raus? Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen. Wer sich ein MMO sucht und mit älteren MMO's nicht mehr glücklich wird - wird hier sicher einige Spass und Erfahrungspunkte finden.

Broken quests from the start for me, got to a point I couldnt carry on because the quest was bugged and I couldnt re start it. But to be honest the tutorial was rubbish with poor translations so maybe i couldnt find the re start.

Graphics are ok, as is sound / music but for me gameplay is poor due to controls being very clunky. Combat looked interesting but confusing to understand.

- I was so hyped about this game, so I bought their founders pack to get that "" 2 days head start "" , etc.

- Got stuck on the loading screen for hours with the towers picture, couldn't even create my char.

- When I finally got in, the FPS was crap and I have EVGA 1080 SC !

- Logging out means you probably won't be able to log in again.

- The lag was terrible, the servers were crowded and the fact that WE AS PREMIUM users didn't got a reserved slot on the servers to log in freely without any problems was so unprofessional !

- Constant updates and creating NEW servers was so stupid ! How the hell you want to release a new game with ONE EU SERVER ????

- No auto attacks

- 2 days head start was a lie obviously , more like few hours head start.

- Waste of money right now.

- Too expensive for getting pretty much nothing as a premium user with founder pack.

All these issues and more add up to a fun game with fast combat. That said, the game is lacking in vision. The story is sleep inducing. I really need to mention how dated the UI is, really, the UI is terrible. 

I feel right at home in this mess of an MMO. If you're looking for hand-holding tutorials or any guidance at all don't bother with Bless Online. Bless is a throwback to a less casual attempt at gaming while retaining a few modern mechanics; but even those improvements to the older structure have a terrible UI, really, Neowiz; near 70 million spent on this and you have a UI that feels like a cheaply copied Windows 3.1. 

Needs:
A complete review of all translations with a team dedicated to consistent usages for skills, stats, and other shared-terms.
A complete and total UI gutting. Seriously, the UI is terrible, fix it. The only redeeming quality is that there's a light transparent view for detail behind the UI.
Fix the early level scaling and mana/resource generation. Early combat is stunted by severe resource issues. Resource management should be gradually applied, not required immediately. This includes fixing the tuning of Paladin damage (Neowiz acknowledged though Emissaries that it is incorrectly tuned)
Fix hit box and AOE indicator issues (late hits, out of range hits, and damage AOE hitting before channel is complete and out of zone)
Major QoL pass for all game systems.
Address the feature-incomplete menus for current systems (kind of related to UI issue, but some basic features are missing from MMO staple systems)

Bottom line: The game is fun. It's nothing new. It doesn't advance the genre. Neowiz is showing that they have a team with a poorly outlined vision that has no idea how to streamline and polish content. Their balancing seems half decent, but there are imbalances in PvP that will hamstring the game from competing with more PvP-centric titles.

Well Yes and No, if you're paying the normal standard price hell yes, buy it, it's fun!
If you're like me and you want ALL the cosmetics so you decide to pay 150 bucks don't bother, atleast not yet, the game needs a LOT of improvements, for starters, they NEED to fix the Bless Screen bug, at the moment you have to restart your game MULTIPLE times to even get into the game. The game is also sorley unoptimized and there is no way to optimize it through the game, you have to go into the game engines ini files, there are a bunch of forum posts about it online, so it wont be hard to do.

Aside from those two problems, the game is fun, it feels like the people complaining about it have never sat through an mmo launch before. Tab targetting is a non issue, I personally don't mind Tab targetting but they're releasing action cam for all classes eventually.

The translations can be a bit off in some areas, the most glaring are in the tutorial which if you don't have a prior knowledge can be a bit confusing but it's not game breaking, It's on blade and soul levels of translation which are kind of just funny to me. 

I've played countless MMORPGs in the last 10 or so years and this is by far not the worst launch I've been through, this has been handled quite well, the CM's (Community Managers) are quite active in helping, both in tickets and on the official Bless Discord.

ich möchte mich einmal kurz zu Bless Online für Europa äußern und versuche es Objektiv zu schreiben.

Ein Freund, der so wie ich, seit über 15 Jahre MMO´s zockt, erzählte mir von BO und wie toll es doch wohl sein würde.
Daraufhin habe ich mir das Founder Deluxe Paket zugelegt.
Dass es beim Headstart Probleme mit der Latenz & Co. geben würde; damit war zu rechnen und okay.
Aber es ging fast gar nichts, weder das erstellen eines Chars auf dem Wunschserver, um mit den besagten Freunden zusammen zu starten, noch das Gaming: es dauert ab und an bis zu 3 Minuten, bis ich meine Rüstung wechseln kann, ein Teil. 
Okay Lag´s....alles gut...aber eine Übersetzung in´s deutsche fehlt völlig; nur bei einigen Zwischensequenzen gab es kurze deutschsprachige Untertitel.
Aber Menu, Erläuterungen?! Hilfetexte?! Nichts!!!

Die Grafik ist schön gemacht, man darf nicht vergessen, für ein 7 Jahre altes Game, klasse! Aber ganz weit weg von Zeitgemäß.
Ebenso die Feinheiten der Grafik, das verbundene Miteinander von Gebäuden und Landschaft z.B. ist oft nicht schön.

Aber was mich nun zum Rückzug bewegte; zum Einen die weiteren Extremen und unspielbaren Lag´s....das noch immer nicht erstellen von Chars auf dem Server der Freunde...da bringt mir der Headstart wenig, bzw. gar nichts!

- Novità del combat system. Cè poco da dire, è divertente e complesso da perfezionare.
- Velocità nella gestione delle problematiche. Ragazzi dove si è mai visto che aprissero server nel giro di ORE.

Decent combat, decent soundtrack, decent graphics. There is a whole lot about the game that is decent, not a whole lot about the came that really makes it stand out from most other MMO games on the market at the moment. The good news is that since it is early access the devs do have times to fix the game and if they do they will have a fairly good product, and if they do not they will have lost their player base, in the end it all comes down to the choices they make before the full launch.

Things that I could complain about at launch that are no longer an issue: 

FPS/Optimization. I am running max settings except for shadows and get more than 60 fps everywhere, including the capital cities.

Splash screen stuck. They fixed this quite fast.

Some language translation errors. They recently fixed some of these, although I'm sure more exist.

Various bugs and errors, mainly with quests.

Making the game somewhat more challenging by lowering our dps, which I'm in favor of. They recently changed it yet again, as of this post and it is less extreme.

Give the devs more time, they're doing a wonderful job thus far. I've really been enjoying this game, and I am eagerly looking forward to its future. Neowiz deciding to be their own publisher was an excellent idea and is really what they needed for this game in the west.

You couldn’t log in the first day. 
What did you expect on a launch day?
The graphics suck, it’s not stable for my 1080ti and dual titan gpu I need 200 FPS!
It’s on dx9 and unreal engine 3 all this can be upgraded in time.(Look how far runescape graphics have come from 2D) Was PUBG optimized when it came out? Hell no yet through time they fixed it and it’s the most played steam game to this date. 
The game has been out in Korea and Russia and Wukanda they’ve had plenty of time to fix everything!
They changed the entire combat system obviously with that alone there’s a lot of tweaks it’s gonna need before they can focus on the current bugs it already had.
To sum it down no game is perfect or will ever be perfect the day it comes out they become good with support. Everyone wants a perfect mmorpg but quit one day after starting because it wasn’t perfect and won’t support it anymore. This game has a lot of work ahead of it and in my opinion potential for me to level up multiple characters to max. I played to the point of looking at my phone and saying oh fuck it’s 6 am something no game has made me do in a while. Rather than saying “Screw this refund” how about send a ticket or forum post saying what’s wrong and what you want implemented without feedback this isn’t going to go anywhere and you’ll be stuck looking for the WOW killer that’s never going to appear.

Right off the bat this MMO feels so fluid, and combat feels smooth, The graphics are pretty good and the details in locations are good. There is a lot of good in this game. As for overall design of the game, its spectacular.

But there is a great deal of underdeveloped qualities in this game. Abilities and skills are just too vague. I have no Idea where my character is heading and feel like I have no real control over how my character progresses. Other problems have been reported in translations and there are issues with servers, For instance, my pc is intel i7 32 gig ram, with NVidia 1080 ti and Initially I was running settings at max, but it is just not possible. As soon as I completed tutorial and headed for the capital city, it was a disaster. The game is simply not optimized, and I cannot imagine the difficulty lower spec users are suffering. There are other issues with quest markers, and balanced problems.

Overall, the game needs to be fixed, there is work to be done here, but, I still have very high hopes for this game. I will not be refunding it because I do see that everything that they need to make this game spectacular is here.

Yes they could talk more to us, but then again i rather have them talk less and focus on fixing the things that need to be fixed.

As always people are faster to criticize instead of having a little of patience.

The combat feels good, the story is ok, nothing major but still interessting enough so that i not just skip through it, and the translations are fine for me. so ppl who have the ability to actual read and use there brains won't have that much of an issue. sure the tutorial part where there tell u to mount the second stance was confusing but how hard is it to combine that if u have one already equiped and u have only one more to choose that even if the name not match that would be the one. 

ppl cry about poor optimisation and all. sure it could be better and there will have to take another look at it but the game is still playable. there is an fps fix out there thats not hard to do and improves the game a lot. i for myself have no high end computer and have 0 issues with the game performance wise without the fix. what get me wondering how some of the ppl who defenetly have a high end pc because there say so themself can have issues while i compared to there pc run the game on a toaster and have no issues at all.

7.  Pet Taming (got a blue today)

1. Not getting everyone from our gaming community in the same server due to the ""no new character creation at this time"" thing on servers.

1) PERFORMANCE - The poor optimization was one of the main reason Bless failed in KR/RU/JP and now it's one of main reason why it will fail in NA/EU. Sure, there are manual .ini settings that can be tweaked to help with the fps/stuttering issues  but why does the player have to do the developers' job?

2) TRANSLATION - It's so bad and I know that this is Neowiz's first time self-publishing a game and these translation errors will be fixed over time, but come on... First impressions are the last impressions, did they actually hire someone to localize the game or did developers just used some outdated version of google translator?

3) INCOMPETENCE - The developers don't seem to know what they're doing nor can they decide on what they want. They're extremely slow on their decision making and response time, leaving the community to speculate and fight over issues that could've easy been addressed from the get-go.

4) CENSORSHIP - The removal and alternation of entire cutscenes/questlines was something that no one asked for, nor was it ever mentioned by the developers pre-launch and the chat filtering system is so bad that it offends people rather than protect them, all of this just so you can change the rating from Mature to Teen? Why throw the majority under the bus just to please the minority?

I can continue on with more reasons but I don't want to make this review too long. OVERALL THOUGH, I was impressed with the new combat, though flawed, it was fun and engaging. The world of Bless is huge and the ability to tame and capture  almost any monster is a plus. The PVP looks entertaining and the whole RvR/FvF/GvG aspect of the game looks very promising. The game is burning right now, but if the developers could just address these issues, the fire will stop and people will return with positive reviews.

Now for the bad parts....

For a game that was released in 3 different gaming territories (Korea, Japan, nd Russia), you would think they would have gotten all their bugs and kinks out before the release to NA/EU.  All they had to do was translate the game, remove the P2W elements, fix maybe some combat variables to make it more western friendly....oh...no....for 7 years, and this game is as astrocious as an alpha release.  And it's not even a NEW GAME.  It's a SEVEN (7) YEARS OLD GAME that finally got released to the NA/EU territories.  7 YEARS!!!   The game is plagued with bugs, server problems, quest problems, loading screen problems.....this is stuff for new games that was just made.  But this game has already been released in other territories.  This shouldn't be an excuse just because it's ""Early Access"".  ""Early Access"" after 7 years?  Yeah, my arse.  I expect this game to be 95% polished, with 5% bugs being more like...mistranslations, combat balance for pvp, combat balance for pve and dungeons/raids, English and other language misspellings and such.  Minor bugs that usually aren't caught initially until you get a lot of people to try it out.  This was a horrible launch.  I have played MMOs for 30 years since the days of MUDs (text based MMOs), and this is a sorry excuse of bad launch.  The last game I experienced in a ""beta"" environment that had a horrible launch was Vanguard, and look where that MMO went....it died. 

First impressions mean everything to keep players engaged.  The first impression I had was....I downloaded the game...and in 10 hours of trying to play the game....I either 1) crashed, 2) failed to load, 3) stuck in loading screen, 4) stuck in black screen of death when trying to change character, 5) got flagged as PvP so my own Hieron city NPCs decided I was the opposing faction and insta-killing me, 6) can't continue quests because they keep freaking failing due to above crashes.  I barely got less than an hour of playtime in this game and I wasted 10 hours to this early access early play time to not be impressed with this piece of garbage.  I refunded this game and I am thankful I did.  THis game was stressing me out to no ends.  Other Korean MMOs had better better and better stress tests without the crap bugs and crashes I have experienced in this game that is already SEVEN YEARS OLD!!!

This game deserves all the negative reviews and criticism.  A game like this that has been out already in other territories should not have these kind of failures.....PERIOD.

If it only had minor stuff, this game would have been so much better.  I watched all I could with this game and now it's lost another player who could've spent countless of money on Lumena.  So long for that.

(Early Access Review): Yes, it had a rough start. Neowiz announcing they were only going to launch with two servers, one EU and one NA... by 10:10 AM PDT those two servers were already full. Give or take another ten minutes two more servers had already been added NA. Within the hour most players couldn't get past the launch screen... and if you were able to get on a server you had quest NPCs taking 3 to 5 minutes to respond to quest updates. The game was brought down a few times to fix these errors and would only be down for about an hour to an hour and a half. Mind you, the game just launched, were they prepared for it? Not completely but not worse than other MMOs. 

(Actual Game Play): Besides from some translation blunders and the tutorial not exactly explaining the UI interface, the community Help chat is actually pretty insightful and responds quickly to basic questions if the game doesn't explain it well enough for you to figure it out. Once you get past the first possibly ten levels... things get easier. Now pathfinding is special, if you want to AFK during those moments to check your phone or go to the bathroom it's great... but if you actually pay attention to your character at all, you'll notice you'll go some pretty bizarre paths to get to your destination and that's if you don't get trapped on a rock or step. 

Early levels are not party friendly, until mid-teens about the time you get to the first dungeon is when you'll start actually getting quest items with your party, etc. As for the taming... be prepared to test out your reflexes and your spacebar.  Either way, plenty of pets and mounts to pick from assuming you can get the level scrolls you'll need. And for crafting, extracting, and upgrading all seem to be pretty similar to many other MMOs. Just be prepared... remember you cannot trade fellow players. 

Lastly, the game is promising. Third or fourth time(s) the charm? Don't let the negative reviews fool you... a lot of anger over the early access will die down in a few days and as long as Neo has plans for some end-game content and adding the additional classes... you'll have plenty to do to keep you busy.

[h1] The Bad[/h1] 
I highly recommend staying away from this unfinished, unpolished piece of dung, the performance is abysmal, i was getting 8fps in town, open world as long as no one was around i had a constant 60, got into a small camp with a few people, it dropped to 30ish, for a 3 year old game running UE3, cmon, its 2018 we expect better.

Text in general was not properly translated, in fact it was confusing, i wasnt sure what my skills did, doing the tutorial was very confusing because of it, it was telling me to add stuff to my bars that didnt exist, they had different names than what the actual quest text said.

[h1]The Good[/h1] 
The combat was actually entertaining, it wasnt a big deal, like nothing revolutionary, but it was enjoyable, questing was pretty standard, a pretty ok ish mmo when it was working at least.

The voice acting was actually ok and well done, which is amazing for an asian mmo honestly and the story though I didnt really get very far seemed interesting.

[h1]Conclusion [/h1] 
The launch experience i wont really complain about, I really wouldnt mind sitting in queue if I knew the game was worth it, but it's not, it really isnt, its not a playable acceptable product, and honestly early access doesnt justify all the issues.

It looks fairly decent, but runs awfully while doing so. On a 5820k @ 4.7 & and 1080, I'm getting 100 fps farming, with no one around me AFTER .ini fixes. PvPing against 10 people dipped me down to 30 constantly with stuttering occuring far too often. 

The main reason I bought this game was PVP. At it's current state, there is no Arena, Ranked, Honor Point system (working, it's bugged currently), among glaring balance problems. While I can't speak for 100v100, I can safely assume it's nearly unplayable.

Leveling was fine, around 30 it started slowing quite a bit and forcing me to take quite a bit of side quests. 

I hope for nothing more than this game's success. In it's current state though, I can't recommend anyone spend it's current pricetag. The devs haven't made this game a labor of love, which is what I was hoping for. The glaring problems from previous versions, are still glaring problems now. After years of development and in production, I was really hoping for a new renovation of the game. I really didn't get anything I was hoping for. 

I highly suggest you look at something like GW2 that's free-to-play, and essentially does what this game does, but better. Tactics are essentially weaponsets in GW2, and each have Utility skills you can manipulate. Skills also combo in GW2 linearly, instead of separate chains. Regardless of this, I feel the system is much more polished and playable.

First, a word on the current storm of negative feedback surrounding Bless. This game was previously released in other countries. However, the North American version of Bless is Early Access. In other words, this game is NOT a finished product. The development team has stated, in so many words, that they are using the resources provided by Early Access to rebuild Bless into a new and better game.
That said, In it's current state, the game is very playable. It's got a lot of great ideas, some original, and many reminiscent of other games. Though, there are a few bugs that range from the slightly annoying, to the downright irritating.
The combat is where Bless shines. It's very smooth, and well animated. There's very visceral feel to it that really makes the character feel powerful. The character actions are a blend between combo abilities (similar to BDO), and 1 off actions that all have a variety of different cool downs.
Character creation is deep, and well thought out with a lot of great presets to start from which allows a variety of good looking characters without a lot of time investment. If desired, more time can be spent to create something totally unique, or even possibly absurd. Ralph Pootawn comes to mind here. Templates can also be saved for later use, and the files can be provided to other players to load for their characters. I'll also not that characters don't start out looking like homeless drifters. Right from the beginning, they look at least respectable.
The UI is very well done, but the translations are a work in progress. 90% of the time they will be enough to get by.
There is an included auto run system that allows your character to automatically travel from one location to another, and it works exceptionally well most of the time. Often times the path it will take the character is inefficient to varying degrees. It tends to be wide on corners, and it often will walk you all the way around an area rather than straight through it. On the plus side, my character has yet to get stuck while auto running.
I've only briefly used the taming system, but so far it seems interesting. All characters are able to tame almost any animal in the game, and then use it as a mount or a combat pet. I've managed to tame 5 different animals as mounts. This has proven very useful, as each mount has it's own stamina that is consumed while riding, but slowly regenerates when not in use.",True,1527661773,1527661773,True,0,0,0.000000,True

This game is PVP orientated, But we do not even have PVP Arena's or Battlegrounds. So we cant even convert PVP points to Lumena which they have shown during the Emissaries event.

Also the game has numerous bugs and even some game breaking bugs. You cant walk through the city without having 10 FPS while i have a GTX 1080. For some reason everything is ServerSide loaded. Yes you can manually tweek the config files but so can Neowiz. Seems they havent played the game themselves since Action Combat which was shown in trailers isn't even in the game due a ""bug"". They didn't find till launch.

Also the dungeon finder is shit. It took me 3 hours to find a party? Like what the hell there are 40k players playing the game. I doubt noone is doing the dungeon.

And of course for the finisher of the game. You can dupe items and its easy aswell. Just any stack thats tradable will do.

I wasn't really expecting much but what I do expect is optimzation on such a outdated engine that is UE3 which was used. I can understand some server lag especially on release but this is different. FPS is all over the place with solo instances being the closest you can come to something repectable. 

Pros: 
- Generic MMO which is good because its not trying to hard to be something that is not already succesful.
- Ability to tame PvE Mobs and use them as mounts
- Combat looks nice (but isnt)
- Classic currency system with silver/gold and gold seems difficult to obtain. 
- Not horrible english voice acting.
- MUSIC IS FANTASTIC (however see below)

Cons:
- Performance
- Missing Classes that have been available for years.. Not such an issue but items for those classes drop and are specific to those classes that are not released or have a timeframe.
- Horrible text translation ""You Achieve 20LVL"" 
- Basic Chat Filter.. word such as Damage are deemed inapropriate.
- PERFORMANCE again.. and again. 
- Devs thought it was intelligent to launch an MMO with only 1 NA/EU server.. didnt think they were going to be popular?
- Combat lag.. mainly during combo attacks. Delay is like working with a bad ping.
- Huge cities that feel empty
- Important NPC's just placed in non-themed random areas
- World seems generic- Mainly Cities
-No Fall Damage!!! How is this even possible in a MMO that will eventually have World PvP. I guess just jumping down mountains will have no negative penalty.. Lets hope no cool Warlock Fear abilites that could have once been cool. 
- PvE enemies appear in the exact same places.. No randomness for doing hunts 
- Horrible travel system that performs and looks like trash. 
- Embarrasing travel .. Gryphons, Dragons, Airships... and Gondola Rides!!!!!!!
- Horrible UI which doesnt seem to be customizable.
- Quests require steps which require the player to open tabs which overlap next quests steps. 
- Menus are very laggy
- Menus and overall game feels very F2P 
- Game has a upfront cost and requires a 10/month fee.. Why when I die the first option is to ""Revive Here"" by using real money currency!?!?
- Combat is very easy for PvE and really boring and repetitive.
- Music is not used appropriatly for the MMO and scene. Just feels like a great soundtrack composed of two very talented artists went to waste in a world that just wanted sound and not substance and mood.

PROS:

Character creation is pretty detailed so you can make a lot of cool and sexy looking characters.

Architecture in cities and environment are pretty good looking despite graphics not being that great.

CONS:

Game optimization is very very poor. Sure it is launch and major cities always have some fps drops it does not explain why the only place I could get constant 60 and have decent expierence was the dungeon. Most of the times anywhere else in the world fps would and the game would even freeze time to time.

Combat is pretty iffy and it is about 50% done of what was promised. The only class that has fully reworked action combat is berserker. They also called it rhythmic combat, but I does not seem like it. The moves are pretty clunky and animations don't really match up the skills being casted. A lot of skills also make your character very static while at the same time mobs throw out a lot of different attacks that should be avoided.

Cash shop is okayish, it does not seem to be pay to win, but the prices are considerably high for what they are offering. Another thing to note is the resurrection system which uses real money currency Lumena. When you die you either run back to your corpse or you can pay some amount of Lumena to resurrect on your body.

UI is pretty terrible in Bless, it is probably one of the worst I have seen in MMORPGS. Some places are hard to navigate and majority of bindings do not make sense. Another thing to note is the translation which is so awful, it feels like it was done with Google Translate.

As it is now the game feels more like a cash grab then actually a try to fix the shortcomings of previous versions. If you're like me and feel this game is a smelly pile of poo and lies then go for refund, even with more that 2 hours played there is possibility to get money back.

When it comes out later today i would glady pay 30 dollar as that's what this game is worth at the moment. Its not a bad game and as frustrated as I am right now I really want this game to work. I wont go into much detail cause so many people have explain this in there comments 

Con:

Bad translation
Horrible fps
freezing at the title screen
bad business pratices
bad support team
missing combat mode(action mode)
founder packs can be missing upon reciving.

pro:
I personally like the story for certain races(when the tranlastion isn't horrible)
good combat
generally a fun game


Like I said until they fix and update the game I don't recommand getting the founder packs, and if you really want to try it out just pay the 30 dollars, the game has potential to be good, I've been waiting for some sort of mmo to come out so despite all of that i will still hang on to the hope that game will be good. I bet im not the only one too despite all the negative reviews.

Schritt 2. Sicher darüber aufregen das man im Startbildschirm hängen bleibt. Nach 2 - 50 versuchen ist man dann endlich drin.
Schritt 3. Eine Warteschlange von 2500 Spielern. Hab gehört AFK Spieler werden nicht gekickt. Also morgens einloggen und arbeiten gehen.
Schritt 4. Nach 2 Std Warteschlange schafft man es dann online zu kommen nur um nach 2 Schritten eine Nachricht zu erhalten, das man vom Server disconnected wurde.

I was so hyped for the US release of bless, i was on board to buy the $200 collectors edition and when it got dropped to $150? hell yeah. Let me just say, this game had the right idea because hot damn, high end dungeons/PvE content, open world PvP with massive guild v guild siege modes, gotta catch em all 2018 simulator with a ton of unique looking creatures and a dope as hell character creator? sign me right up.

The idea was great, how it was presented was absolute soggy garbage and i refunded this product after 10 hours because i could not stomach supporting this company with a collectors edition purchase. Frame drops/terrible optimization, poor localization (god that combat poison translation error in the TUTORIAL was beyond bad), empty game world outside of certain sections, random crashes, and awkward combat with it's stance system, which i almost want to say this is WORSE than the previous combat system.

The only fun i had in this game was making my character and getting to experience the new player rush from a new mmo,  outside of that the experience was less than mediocre. OH everything i just mentioned only applies if you actually got into the game itself, dozens of start ups (hundreds if i'm feeling dramatic) just to see the logo and not actually play the game. 

I was worried i wouldn't be able to grab a refund for the game due to me redeeming my collectors edition grab bag but there were no worries, got an almost immediate confirmation and pending refund email. Might actually go pick up a few fun games now here in seven days. Save yourself the pain and heartbreak, do not buy this game or wait until they eventually go Free2Play because we all know that's going to happen.

- Tutorials that're bugged and mismatched for the wrong classes.

- Horrendous translations to english the likes of which not even google translate could muster.

- FPS stuttering on even the most modern of rigs with many reporting drops below 30 FPS on specs that far outclass the recommended builds.

- Lack of action combat camera on all classes bar the berserker.

- Gear drops and tooltips popping up for classes that aren't even in existence yet (Mystic, Assassin and Warlock)

- Servers frequently shit themselves so if you get into a fight (PVP or PVE) during that expect to start teleporting around à la dragonball Z

Can't speak for crashes as I've crashed twice in 20+ hrs combined.  All in all, the ini tweak is huge.  The game is DX9 and doesn't really make full use of modern hardware.

Combat
As far as combat, I've only played mage and paladin, both were smooth enough.  Not action combat smooth but nowhere near as delayed as FFXIV.  Especially at 2.0 launch.  It's the same basic tab targeted combat found in most classic MMOs, but with combo instead of rotations. You end up with two tactics or action button rotations you can swap between freely out of 6.  Thankfully, it doesn't have massive global cooldowns that really stutter combat.  The keyboard gymnastics needed for comboing on the other hand is annoying to me but you can remap the keys.

UI
The UI is plain, boring, and takes up a LOT of the screen.  Can't resize things and very few things can be turned off.  I never understood why games just didn't adopt what Rift did ages ago and make everything customizable.  This would be a really nice thing that should be fixed with polish.

Leveling 
Leveling has lots of main story and side quests, if you focus only on the main quests you can dead end a few times but if you actually do the rest of the content, it's not a problem.  Dungeons are fun enough without feeling tedious.  Granted, if you're trying to race to level cap or don't want to explore then I can see how they'd get boring.  This all was very much the same issue with FFXIV's 2.0 launch, except dungeons couldn't even be run for exp due to how low it was.  The only game where the game didn't feel like a grind to launch level cap for me was WoW, but it launched with soooo many quests you could level 2 characters and not repeat quests.

Server issues
Typical launch week woes that could have largely been mitigated if they had an open beta.  Queues, new servers, several maintenance downtimes, and worst of all, locking servers from new characters being created.  Hands down, the worst aspect is starting in head start and then your friends can't join you due to it being locked out.  So when your guildies start the game, they'll most likely go to a server you couldn't even had selected from the get go.  This was the biggest issue with head start imo.  I expect queues, i plan on server communication issues and lag.  I don't expect my whole start to be wasted due to friends being locked out.

Crafting
Surprised you didn't go into this one.  Character to character trading is currently disabled and gathering mats uses consumable items.  Just gathering what you need to start leveling is very expensive for the level (crafting unlocks at 14).  This whole system is rubbish and really lacking for a PVE game.  It hurts the market greatly.  This was one of the really big disappointments of the game.

Areas
I'm playing Union side and so far have liked it enough.  The cities have a massive sense of scale which most games are missing.  The areas have a lot of stuff to kill without being unable to run through without pulling 20 mobs.  Side quests and hunting quests are spread out so it's not too bad.  I will admit the areas lack flavor, but it's got that whole arid desert region thing going on...so yeah.  Just moving to the jungle was a huge flavor change but sadly, lasted all of a couple hours.

Dungeons
I've only been through the first two dungeons so far.  They are pretty direct, easy enough to duo or solo, fun to group with, and decently paced.  I'm curious to see how the party required ones are later on.  I highly recommend not solo grinding the same dungeons for 8-10 levels as that's super boring imo.  Mix it up with some questing here and there and it has a much smoother feeling.

Overall verdict is it's got a good solid base but needs more time to bake.  Not sure what people are expecting for graphics, it's an MMO.  I can't say i've ever been blown away by the graphics of any launch day MMO compared to a top end single player game.",True,1527660565,1527693655,True,0,3,0.496595,True

Basically, the game is something new. That’s about where the fun stops. as of right now. I will try to remember to come back later and re-review - when this game inevitably becomes f2p.

Between the hours spent on the “Bless online” screen, the constant lag, crashes, and downtime, which by the way, is completely forgivable, barring the below, I’ve not seen a worse launch since D3

Once you’re actually in the game, you can get a feel for it, generally speaking I have a decent rig, and sometimes it’s nearly a slideshow, the optimization that was said to be due to UI rework? Yeah not great. But what can you expect from a seemingly rushed product, built on UE3 and DX9. People are modifying .INI files for the love of god, in 2018.

The classes don’t feel very fresh. You got your paladin healer, guardian tank, sprinkle in your bow/magic class for dps, bam, you’ve got an MMO. The one thing that was different was the choice of no auto-attacking, that’s weird to get used to, but the combo system is neat and evens out the experience.

The shop, is pay to advance quicker/convenience, it’s not p2w, but to be competitive you’re probably going to need that sub, or spend some money outside of the game purchase.

The content in general is your typical mmo content, go kill x, go find x, etc.
There is forced pvp in the open world upon reaching a certain level. You can buy an item for in-game currency at first, to “unflag” yourself for 10 minutes at a time I believe. 

Currently according to max level folks, there is a lot of missing content at max level, that was promised with the game. Take that with a grain of salt.

All in all, it was fun to play for a bit, was new and shiny, but ultimately it’s seeming like a shady business practice, in that they were very hesitant to publish anything about their cash shop, and that the content promised for end game is not currently there, along with the whole, ""promised optimization""

All that said, I believe there is a reason this game failed 3 time already. I don’t hold anything against it, it’s a neat concept, just very poorly executed and not worth the money at this point. I’ll probably come back in a  year or so when it’s f2p.

Hence some of the people who bought it early were not able to play it early because of various problems like getting stuck on the opening Bless Online screen, getting disconnected, and seemingly endless que times to name a few.

Like I said earlier, this is early access. Without the problems, I felt like the game mechanics were pretty solid. The guide quests were super helpful and completely necessary. I really liked the cut scenes for the main quest. I felt like the translation problems were minimal. The tab targeting that the mmo community is slowly moving away from felt fresh with the addition of combos (this may be the wrong term), which are skills that have to be activated in a certain order to complete the combo. Along with the combo system the ability for everyclass to have a pet are what makes this different from most other mmorpg's.

Been playing MMO's since 2006 when I was much younger. I've played games like World of Warcraft (my first), Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Elder Scrolls Online, Black Desert Online, Vindictus, Mabinogi, MapleStory, etc. I have played them all, but those are the major titles that come to my mind.

I have been playing a decent amount of Bless Online so far. I am coming to the game mainly for PvP and RP. Currently level 17, but have some guild mates who are near max level. The main questing has been a solid experience with impressive cutscenes. I think the leveling has been too much of a cake-walk, but the Bless staff team have acknowledged this.

There are some serious blemishes. Optimization isn't awful, but it's not great; it's mediocre. The mature language filter needs to be an option, not forced. Length of messages is very short, which hurts the RP community and creates too many separate messages. Server optimization needs to be improved, but I know they're working on it. 

I'm excited to see where this game goes. People destroying it while it's in Early Access is ridiculous, imo. The Bless staff told people there would be issues in EA, and players expect a perfect experience already because they chose to do a soft launch.

 It's a fun game with a decent storyline. The combat has been better than I expected after watching reviews on Youtube. The game does have issues, for sure, such as  getting stuck on the Bless title screen and frequent disconnects. The frame rate does drop quite a bit too. These are also known issues that Neowiz has said they're working on fixing. Neowiz has been working on fixing the issues that keep poping up all through the Early Access.

   Despite all the hiccups in the game, I am having fun. Got my Paladin to lvl 29 and a Guardian to lvl 13. I hope to see more people jumping into the game.

  The BLESS splash screen seems to be fixed for me. Ive been able to log right into the game. I haven't been disconnecting either. So that also seems to be fixed.

I was disappointed with this game causing me to refund. I would love to recommend this game because its the first I have played in which I didn't have to buy a mount or pet and can actually get my own. That I loved and is pretty nice. But the bad fps requiring you to edit ini files to get to properly give you some decent playable fps should not be a thing to have players do. The fact that the hardest boss is the title screen because you will be stopped at that alot before you can even make a character. 
The disconnects was a big killer for this game. I spent a good 3 of my hours in the game trying to connect and make a character just to have a DC. I like to actually make my characters look nice before playing without feeling rushed. I then found out when the disconnect pops up you can keep working on the character and save the look restart and go through the whole title screen boss fight, hope the server you are on didn't block creation of the faction you wanted after the possible que, load your character look, and finalize your character before going into the tutorial and getting thrown off by the terrible google translations with a possible disconnect.
Also the fact that they said they will start with one megaserver with multiple channels but turned around and released multiple servers so if you joined guilds or have friends that got the game and everyone got hit by the server split by either too large a que or the fact that the faction your friends or guild are joining just got locked out you are out of luck playing with them unless they all dont mind going through the character creation process again. There is even the fear if they decided to shut the other servers down to compile back down to one again wiping characters and progression that has driven people away as well.
Out of the 10 hours I wsa on this game, I played only 7 of it and got to level 19 and played the first dungeon. I did enjoy the game some but alot of the glaring issues with reveal that alot of the content is missing from the normal version which should not be a thing for a game especially if you are trying to release a failed game for the fourth time this time to the west which is known to heavily criticize MMOs. After seeing this, I put in my refund and got it. 
The fact that I am around 10-11 hours in on the game and steam gave me a refund should be a clear indication how bad this game is faring as well as the other negative reviews about this game. Now if the game continues and really improve, I will absolutely give this game another try but right now its just not worth playing in its current state.

Bless Online hat viele Fehler zum Start gemacht, viele Bugs, keine Übersetzung in Deutsch zum Start (Außer Untertitel) bis jetzt und sehr viel Serverprobleme.

Was 95% dieser Review-Sektion aber vergessen ist, dass diese Probleme nicht nur an Bless liegen. Auch andere MMORPGs hatten derartig holprige Starts, auch schlimmere. Manchmal auch bessere. Bless würde ich in der Goldenen Mitte ansiedeln und damit als guten Start benoten - um mal 2 konkrete Beispiele zu nennen: Guild Wars 2 als positives Beispiel, ArcheAge als Negativ-Beispiel. 

Nun aber zum Spiel: Ich finde Bless bisher sehr gelungen, das Kampfsystem bietet eine erfrischende Mechanik die auf Combos basiert. Der Fokus des Spiels scheint eindeutig aufs PvP gerichtet zu sein,  Dungeons sind teilweise Solo machbar und gelten momentan einzig zum Level-Push und schnellem Setfarmen.

Auch das Upgrade System der Rüstung ist kein neu erfundenes Rad und erinnert stark an das stark verhasste System von Black Desert Online, allerdings abgeschwächt (Die Schwarzsteine etc. aus BDO zum Upgraden findet man hier deutlich einfacher und ohne einen derartigen Zeitkonsum)

Die Quests sind bisher recht einfach gestrikt, neben der Hauptquestreihe gibt es die bekannten Themepark Quests, dazu ein System das mich stark an das Erfolgssystem von Herr der Ringe Online erinnert hat - nämlich die Hunting Quests, Töte z.B Banditen, Stufe 1: 30 Banditen, Stufe 2: 60 Banditen, Stufe 3 120 Banditen. Das ganze kommt recht erfrischend in die Queststruktur geschossen und bietet eine Menge EXP für die Tätigkeiten, die man ohnehin vorhatte.

Wie das Endgame aussieht im Spiel, kann ich erst zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt beschreiben, momentan befinde ich mich im >20 Bereich. 

Es wird definitiv die nächsten Tage weitere Probleme geben, da jetzt erst noch der große Spieleransturm kommt, der sich keine Headstart Edition gekauft hat oder von der Collectors Edition die Kopie besitzt.

Erwartet daher, wenn es jetzt schon Probleme gab, also keine Wunder, sondern vielmehr das es sich nochmal verschlechtert und dann aufbessert, wenn die Hate-Welle um Bless vorbeigezogen ist.

Wieso das Spiel ""Größtenteils Negativ"" bewertet wurde, ist mir allerdings wirklich schleierhaft. 

Ein ""Ausgeglichen"" hätte ich verstanden, aber das ist einfach nur ein Hate-Train der dem Spiel nicht gerecht wird. Ich weiß auch ehrlich gesagt nicht, wie man Leuten, die so schnell so negativ über ein Spiel entscheiden und dieses dann in Grund und Boden stampfen wollen, weil es ihnen persönlich nicht zusagt, ein MMORPG liefern soll das ihnen gerecht wird.

Sowas kann einfach immer passieren, gerade mit so einer Vorgeschichte wie Neowiz sie hatte, die Probleme mit Steam VOR dem Release und dem Druck den Erwartungen gerecht zu werden ist da einfach genug Potenzial im vorraus für einen holprigen Start gewesen, in so einer Situation würden so einige Spieleschmieden  einknicken.

Ich hoffe ihr könnt euch abseits dieser Review-Sektion nochmal dazu überwinden das Spiel inruhe anzuschauen, wartet aber ruhig noch eine Woche, bis die Release-Welle der Leute vorbeigezogen ist, schaut euch das Spiel an wenn die ersten Kinderkrankheiten ausgemerzt sind.

I followed some streamers/YouTubers who had beta tested the ""new"" Bless Online which was supposedly being configured to suit NA/EU players with a new combo system. The system works, and it feels alright to play with.

The problem arises once I heard the players uproar for not being a P2W (Pay to Win) game, they devs answered that they would promise to keep the game NOT pay to win. These days I have a hard time trusting developers due to the fiasco of other games like Destiny 2 and SW:BF2. But I kept an open mind regardless.

When you start off you're not likely to feel the ""pay for convenience"" as they call it. However once you start queuing up for dungeons is where the game takes a big U-turn in ""pay for convenience"" in order to summon someone you will have to pay the lumina(the currency which you have to PAY real money to get) in order to summon someone to the instance.
This doesn't only discourage people to do instances more than once, it doesn't even make sense(?!) it not convenient to WAIT for someone to WALK to the instance.. 
I'm only 6 hours into the game, therefore I haven't even tasted the real rotten fruit as of yet. I bet there is something that is gated behind Lumina which will infuriate me even more.

Not to mention the servers being UNPLAYABLE at peak hours, the delay is about 30-40 seconds per interaction. Neowiz could've handled this so much better, I guess every developer these days are ""listening to community feedback"" which is code for ""We listen but don't give a rats tail."".

First off, getting into the game is neigh impossible, with issues ranging from stuck on loading/start screens, servers crashing, factions being locked or just general game crashes.

And THAT is only after I somehow managed to start playing, because the very first Intro quest is already near impossible, because the text is both incorrect/copy-paste from one class and also impossible to understand what to do, pure random clicking finally got me past it.

How you can launch a game, without even going through the VERY FIRST QUEST and checking it's text is completely beyond me.

As is, as of today May 30th, the game is a complete technical mess.

Issues encoutered by every users:

• Login roulette. The game will launch and try to connect to the servers, but if it does fail, it'll stay stuck on the welcome screen with no indication whatsoever that it failed. You have to manually close the game and restart, which can take up to two minutes of loading on a HDD, and you better hope it works. It can take more than five attemps, at least on my side.

• FPS is hectic. I have a 1080Ti, i7 7700k 4.2GHz and 32go RAM -- I get dips below 30 FPS regularly. You have to manually edit .ini files to get a stabilized FPS but you'll still suffer in large crowded areas. Worst is that the game isn't even beautiful compared to competitors.

• Translation is incomplete, at times outright incomprehensible. One that really stunned me was the small sentence that congratulate you when you level up: ""You've become 10Level"". There's plenty worse, but this one was the earliest and the one that stuck in my mind.

Servers? Game just got released early, Servers for games are always full and have que, not sure why people whine about it when they know its going to happen, after a few days the ques will be gone, wait a few days if you dont want to see a que, the opening areas will have less competition and you will have a better time!

As for people who are whining about the Packages, They are character and server locked, its stated in several places, so when you grab them make sure you try out the character first, its no ones fault but your own if you grab it without looking.

Nota geral que dou para o jogo (tirando o peso das atitudes de quem o está administrando):> 6,0

Agora explicações sobre o porquê desse possível 10,0 ter virado um 6,0:

-Founder pack extremamente inútil: pelo menos pra mim, o intuito de comprar o founder era a vantagem de poder jogar 2 dias antes dos demais que não quisessem pagar um pouco mais por isso, só que os servidores estão extremamente lotados e batendo fila de 500+ TODOS os dias e horários, isso tirando o primeiro dia de closed que foi um CAOS! o server ficou caindo/reiniciando, bugando e dando rollback. e olha que nem levei em conta os itens adicionais que vieram com o pack (esses pelo menos vão durar por 30 dias e acredito que 2 dias não vão fazer tanta diferença no seu uso)

-Otimização: Tenho um setup bacana (acima dos recomendados) e mesmo assim estou tendo uma dificuldade absurda de segurar o desempenho no game.. Quedas constantes de FPS (40- com as config gráficas em nível médio), os loadings geralmente congelam o jogo como se tivesse usando uma página do explorer no windows 95.

-Bug no Launcher: Provavelmente se você executa o jogo direto pela steam (como eu sempre fiz com todos os jogos) você verá um problema em que seu jogo ficará na tela de loading infinito (antes de entrar para a seleção de servidores). Solução que encontrei foi abrir o launcher do jogo diretamente pela pasta como administrador, mudar a compatibilidade do mesmo para Windows Vista (pois sou windows 7) e para os que tem windows 10 trocar a compatibilidade para windows 8.  mesmo encontrando a solução, foi deprimente perder 1 hora procurando uma solução disso pela internet.

Enfim, dava pra ficar citando pequenos detalhes aqui que podem ser ignoráveis para muitos mas para mim em um conjunto (igual o que está sendo apresentado aos seus clientes) já está fazendo o jogo ser extremamente questionado. Dica que dou é que não comprem o game agora, esperem ver relatos de players sobre as reais mudanças.

The optimizations that were promised by the developers were never delivered upon release (with a 6600k @4.6ghz and gtx 1080 I got ~25 fps in the main cities on the lowest settings). Every time I pressed a skill, my fps took a nosedive from around 110fps (in instanced areas without other PCs, by the way) to around 60 - 75fps, making the combat look more like a slideshow than anything.

They promised complete combat overhaul, yet the new system feels incredibly unrewarding. Chain skills (the vast majority of the skills you use) have a significant delay after the initial press, and more often than not the skills are stationary, making the entire combat feel sluggish and... bad.

The censorship (which is slated to be fixed) is currently unexcusable, with words like ""how"" having the ""ho"" turned into ""**"". Translations are mediocre at best, and the servers are just a total, complete and utter joke. When you crash (which will happen cause the game is programmed terribly), it's a gamble on how many minutes to how many hours (yes, hours) it will take for you to get back into the game, as there is a queue system that somehow allows people to move backwards in queue. 

Questing is... questionable, although that's not really on the shoulders of the NA Neowiz team. There's nothing about the story worth listening to or reading.

As far as a review, and for the record I am not an Emmissary, the game is better than most of the MMOs that I have Played over the past few years.  Haters are gona hate and Ive seen a lot of that so far.  Yes they got slammed with players on release probably a lot more players than they were expecting.  Well they should of known... its been out for 7 years now ... Blah Blah.  When Blizzard released Wrath of the Litch King, their 3rd release, it took days for them to fix the sever crashes and line quesues that they were plagued with. The also had the same issues with their large patches such as Ulduar durring that expansion.  I think that Steam and Neowiz did a comendible job of opening new servers and stabilizing them durring the first 24 hours. I know this because I streamed the entire first 24 hours LIVE as it happened.
  I personally love the gameplay and the fact that there are still que lines on day two has to say something for the gameplay or the servers would be dead. The graphics are beautiful.  Im having no lag issue granted my computer is a beast. But these people saying that they have these awesome rigs and complaining about issues are a little scketchy to me because im only running a GTX 970 and I am having no issues.  There is a lot to do in bless with questing, hunting, farming and crafting with a lot more to come.  The combat system is complex and chalenging and takes a brain. You cant just roll your face across the keys.  It actually takes practice and learning to play your character which is lost from many MMO games today.  There is an auto travel system for many quest which makes questing a bit easier.  There are some issues with translation and items being named one thing but called another but its not too hard to figure out.   People who are only playing for 2 hours and saying the game is worthless wouldnt know if a good game bit them in the arrrsss.  Yes it has issues but it is in no way crap.  I say this as a person who doesnt mind the fact that I payed the amount I did and its the first time I have ever payed more than 60 bucks on a game in 36 years of gaming.

That being said, does it have some issues? Absolutely, the fact that a game can come out without a properly translated tutorial is abysmal and should never have been allowed. However, once you get past the poorly translated skill upgrades, and tutorials, and start getting into the stance changes and skill combos you find yourself experiencing a rather enjoyable and surprisingly unique combat system. If I was to say it did remind me of anything I'd say it's a lot like Blade and Soul in the sense of how you chain together attacks and then much like old school FFXIV:ARR to get the maximum level of tryhard you can even stance dance around if you so desire. 

The game isn't for everyone, especially those who go into this expecting a fully polished, fully finished MMO. Those who joined in the Early Access who have already refunded well, that's unfortunate however most who have already dropped the game, I can honestly say gave up far to early to have been able to experience even a 10th of what Bless has to offer and had they given it more time they might've actually enjoyed themselves.

I would say that this game isn't on the level of other available MMO's even with all of its performance issues resolved however.

Performance:
  - This is a bad release, maybe the worse I've seen on a release.  I would like to add to the already abundant complaints on this that I believe most of these could be positive reviews or at least delayed until people reached late game if the performance issues were not as bad as they currently are.  I think it would be worth checking out recent reviews later if the studio actually invests the effort in fixing this issue.

Quality of Life:
  - You cant trade between your own characters, even premium currency is bound to a single character, which is stuck on a character that I was going to switch off.
  - The UI is clean but not very customizable.
  - Mouse binds are not a thing.

Financial Concerns:
  - A costume is 2600 Lumena, which is a little more that $20 USD.  You can almost get 1 lumina from a low level dungeon run, which means if you ran a low level dungeon 2600 times you could get a costume that way.  You can also get a couple 1-3 lumina from killing players.  
  - Almost nothing is bound to account, meaning you might have to make purchases multiple time compared to other MMO's.
  - I don't know how this game will make money.  The cash shop is over-priced incouraging players to stay away from it.  Theres no subscription.  Poor reviews will drive down sales.
  - I've purchased Lumena from the game that I have never recieved.  Money into the ether.

Poor customization
  - The skill tree has some very easy decisions where it would be foolish to go the other way.
  - Chaining abilites aren't nice, it limits what you can do.  When compared to WoW where you might have a skill rotation that is optimal, this makes it bread and butter by force, and makes skill availability in PVP a thing of luck sometimes.  It demands static rotations in dynamic situations.",True,1527656671,1527718731,False,0,3,0.000000,True

Gameplay:

The combo system is fine but you have to completely rebind all the keys because they're all over the place by default.

I knew the game was already a flop in eastern regions and that their former western publisher, Aeria games, cancelled it. And that says everything, if Aeria games, wich is best known for his sh*tty gaming catalogue, does not want to publish your game...

Bless online is terrible. I will pass on the servers problems or the infamous stucking loading screen bug even if those issues should prevent anyone to pay for it.
 
Let's talk about the game itself then. I think the number one problem of Bless online is his general unfinished and outdated appearance. I will carefully and honestly list for you some of the major issues of the game :

- the poor frame rate, the stutters, the screen freezes (especially when you open the option menu)
- the ugly graphics and gross textures, 
- the clipping at near distance,
- the unnecessary complicated combat system (very static and outdated by the way),
- the music stopping suddenly without any reason,
- the poor in game cinematics
- the poor localization
- the roughness of the UI (the option menu looks like a dev build), 
- the keybindings reseting to default after returning to the game,
- the mirrored races (the 4 races of the two factions are the same, only their names change ), 
- the missing classes (not gender or races locked, they're just greyed and unavailable in the character creation)... 
- ... Yet their stuff are available in the loot table (wich means that you can loot an armor for assassin while the class didn't exist in the game, minimizing your chances to have some adequate loot for your class).
 
Everything feels like it was (badly) made 10 years ago... On top of that you can't choose your faction on certain servers because Neowiz force your ""choice"" at the creation of your character ( seriously Neowiz ? And how can I catch up with my friends if I can't choose their faction ? ). 

Bless online is clearly an attempt from Neowiz to make money with a old game unpublished in western regions.
They're just trying to do what Black Desert publisher did last year, sell for 40 bucks a F2P game to westerners foolish enough to pay for it... 

I'm not angry against Neowiz, they did well... they took their sh*t and brought it on Steam, convinced that they will be some gentlemen and women like me willing to pay to taste it. GG guyz.

Yes, there is your typical mmo launch issues present at the time I'm writting this review but if you played through quite abit of launches, You would expect such things to occur at this point, especially when the developers are self publishing it after being trapped in publisher hell for years now. 

Outside of those issues you'll find this game to be a nice change of the typical forumal. ""kill x mob"" quests now are something completely optional called ""hunt quests"" and the main storyline is rather enjoyable to read through on the union side as most of the quests from 10+ onward are political based. Then there is the ""guide"" quests which will pop up as you level, they teach you things ingame.

Mount and Pets, as advertised, can be obtained from pretty much anywhere in the game by just taming a enemy, you can even have a hippo mount if you wish and the Character Customization is very flexable, to the point where you can be a deformed monster. 

The combat system as a Berserker is quite good. I'll admit it's not 100% action combat but for what it is, it surprisingly works quite well and feels very rythmic, as was advertised. The only issues with the combat is that close range fighters have a huge disadvantage against long range fighters. 

The crafting system can be confusing if you are coming from something like WoW, as you cannot just craft all the time by a simple button press. No, instead you gotta craft at a certain station which you can also purchase a portable version of via an ingame merchant for like 3 gold, which just 1 gold can take abit to get, But the crafting requires ingriedients and you also gotta learn recipes, you dont just know how to create everything and can make it right then and there. If you got the right ingredients and you are using the right station, you'll craft the item by your typical crafting menu but it's sorted by what type of recipe it is. The creation of the recipes item is no different from other mmos really. Click then watch some bar and bam, you made it. 

Exploration is tied to questin but you can choose to ignore the quests and just go out and do whatever.  Like doing some pvp. Which speaking off, there really isn't much pvp going on ingame even though is a open pvp game. Different factions or even opposing guilds can attack you. 

The art style speaks for itself, really. The screenshots you see is how the game will look, pretty much.

Translations are crap.
Game runs like crap.
optimized like crapl.
Unreal Engine 3 and Direct X 9 in 2018, okay.
The game looks like its from 2012..

The world feels empty and dull. Lack of NPC's and Monsters.
Cities are bland.

NO action combat for all classes, only berzerker has it. was temporarily disabled without ANY notice. A big selling point was action combat, well looks like devs clearly didnt fix that before release..

This NA/EU version Dont feel different from the jap/kr version at all..
Makes me wonder what the hell they did all this time, feels like absolutely NOTHING..

For now, I'd definitely stay away from this game and request a refund if you bought it. 

This game is NOT an early access title, stop defending it as that..
The game was released years ago.

Why sadly? Because the combat was pretty fun in the time that I played. With some improvements, I can see small and large scale PVP being fun with this combat. However, this is another one of those early access games that has flaws that wouldn't have been acceptable of anything that costs money. Optimization is a complete joke, with 20 FPS being the standard for the best of times. This is essentially the same optimization the game had in it's other regional releases, despite promises upon promises that this time was different!

Speaking of ""this time it's different,"" an action camera mode was promised with this release as a replacement for tab targetting MMO gameplay that we are all sick of. This option was shown in every trailer, and at the emissary event weeks ago for every class. Yet, the game released without this feature for 4 of the 5 classes.
Despite the fact that the shield of ""early access"" is easy to hide behind with this one, I'm still going to call it out: the localization for anything that matters in this game is dreadful. The story quests are fully voice acted and have proper english text, but the tooltips for skills and passives are google-translate level of indecipherable, and a lot of side quests and tutorials are the same. The very first tutorial asks you to do something with ""combat poisoning,"" when it's asking you to equip a stance...

Despite all of this, the developers have been stone silent about these issues. The only official thing they've said since launch was a post saying damage was out of whack compared to healing, and that they were aware of the issue.  None of the other issues though, no timelines for fixes, nothing. We exist in a world now where developer communication is considered a bare minimum, and eventually every developer has to realize this and be prepared. 

This is all outside of servers issues, some of which are expected for an MMO launch, others are the result of pure incompetence on the developer's decision making abilities. This game could be great with some serious work, which is what is hoped for from the money a developer receives from early access.

crucial as the combat system and skill mechanics. Imo its a very bold thing to do and alot of games out there could benefit from doing more things like that.

As for the game itself, i think it is very impressive. 
Its fun, and that even while it was plauged with the normal launch day issues most mmo games end up having.

the character creation is superb! now some of the functions seem to be missing on launch like the lighting option dosnt actually do anything atm but as far as options go it really feals like this game has been watching and learning over from its peers, grab and drag body parts, sliders for everything, free style color options, in terms of functionallity id say its a close second to the black desert creator if not on the same level

The combat which was a topic most were worried about is actually really nice, its not pure action combat but once i played around with it and understood how it work it started to become very satisfying

one thing i was worried about thanks to revelation online was the amount of effort actually put into localizing the game. did they do voice acting? was it any good? did they spend more that 10 mins thinking about the dialouge they translated?  yes yes and yes, the voice acting is very very good, i would go so far as to compare it to ff14 voice acting or at least a close second. the translation is decent right now with some spots here and there that can throw you way off
hopefully the devs see these and fix them up in the coming week, that would be the true test. 

then of course i should also point out the main issues i had with the game so far.

one big issue is the splash screen bug. you start thegame and end up stuck at the splash screen. somtimes you do somtimes you dont but its a real pain to have to restart the game several time before you actualy get to do anything in it
hopefully they fix this immediately because it just seems like a simple fix

another would be that translation. when its good its very good which is most of the time. but when its bad its possible that you will be totally lost on what is is your supposed to be doing. i spent a good 20 mins trying to figure out what skills  the tutorial quest was talking about due to inconsistantly named skills. and when you level it does the weird thing of saying youve reached x-level instead of level-x

and lastely the language filter XD, over reactive language filter that will blot out anything with 'ag' in it but some how miss   certain actual sensor worthy terms. its even sensored an anounce ment made by admins that they were trying to fix the issue. but at least they know about it

I think this game really has alot of potential. ive only seen footage of what it was before the change and playing the now version i can say im glad i never did play the before because the changes made it so much more interesting. my one wish is that it stears clear from the path that revelation online chose. that being the constant introduction of new content before actually acknowlodging let alone fixing bugs and other issues in game.",True,1527653503,1527653503,True,0,2,0.500945,True

Founder's pack items only bind to ONE character, and yes, that includes the currency for the ingame shop.  Aside from that, I had a real hard time with the title screen boss.  The gameplay itself is pretty vanilla, which I really don't care, I knew I was in for a retro feel, but it's not compelling enough for me to try to restart my game several times before working (and yes, I did try the ""fixes"" people have mentioned on Youtube videos and forums).

The FPS dips that affected many people wasn't TOO bad.  However, I actually had to go into the game engine file and manually change the minimum, and no one should have to do that.  Even with this fix, the game FPS dropped or even locked up when performing certain actions, and especially right before cinematics were triggered.

Technical difficulties aside, the translation is awful.  I got stuck in the tutorial longer than I care to admit because it asked me to equip a ""poison"" when it really meant for me to put a stance in a skill slot.

Day 2: Cannot get onto my original server due to queue times and the queue freezing randomly, forcing a full restart. Made another character on a new server and got in no problems. Made it less than 5 minutes into the tutorial quest. Cannot for the life of me understand the horrible translation. Knew from other users that it was god awful. Still couldn't figure out how to add skills to my bar or whatever it wanted from me. I must be hella disabled to not figure out something as simple as clicking a skill I guess.

I managed to get 3 character 2 in one server at lvl 35 and one in another server to lvl 30. I did this because i know the ""first"" server I am in will always have millions of ppol in it so there will be ""queue"" issues, so i made another character in a low populated server so i can continue playing. 

The second issue is the ""Loading Screen"". I managed to get around it by changing from ""full screen"" to ""borderless windows"" or ""Full windows"". I just keep switching and i notice its on the ""loading screen"" for more than 10 seconds, i quit the game and restart the cycle until i get to the character select screen. Once i see how long the queue is for the main server, i go to the second server.

Third issues is the random crashing. I know this one is the worst but i just remain calm as i know its only ""50%"" of the game. the first 3 hours i had lots of crashing and fps. After I made some changes to the .ini also uncapping the FPS i haven't crashed at all unless the server maintenance comes up and disconnects me.

The game is poorly optimized.  If you want the better performance, you have to dig in to the .ini files and make edits.

The tutorials (You know, the first thing you see after you make your character) might as well still be in a foreign language for all the sense they make.  In the Paladin tutorial I was asked to ""Attach 'Hinder Tactics' combat poison to an empty slot in the Link Tactics tab and add 'Focus' technology to an empty slot.  What they meant for me to do was assign the 'Intimidation Tactics' stance  and the 'Concentration' ability to the bar through a series of clicks (no drag and drop.)  It was very frustrating and confusing for someone who has no idea how to play the game.

Combat consists of tab-targeting and spamming 1-R-R and 2-R in the early levels and I only assume expands to include 3, T, and Y for your chains.  I found using R, T, or Y to be very inconvenient and wanted to map them to some of my mouse buttons, but only the middle mouse button was able to be mapped in game.

I had issues with quest advancement and completion, but I don't fault them for that as it was likely due to launch day server issues.  There is the issue of the opening splash screen, however, that would just sit there until you restart the game for another chance at actually launching the game.

It is absolutely not worth 52.99CAD, or whatever price it will be once it officially launches.

Keep in mind this game is almost now 7 years old and has been launched in multiple markets. After all this time to have the same optimization problems that caused publishers to drop out and forced them to self-publish through Steam is just astonishing to see from a business perspective.

It seems the video game industry is the only industry in which you can give customers broken products and then ask them for money and tell them it’s ok we will fix it later.

Não é o melhor MMO que eu joguei nos últimos 5 anos. Lançamento complicado, erro na tela de login que pediu uma maratona para ao menos entrar na seleção de servidores e otimização péssima, beirando o rídiculo para um jogo lançado em 2018.

Apesar do primeiro dia ter sido uma vergonha, o decorrer das horas me trouxe surpresas relativamente agradáveis. A mecânica do jogo apesar de target traz uma mistura de FFXIV e Guild Wars 2. A partir do nível 20 você sente o combate mais fluído e interessante, ainda não sei dizer se o ping é o motivo, mas em algumas situações a transição entre as Tacticas das classes é meio travada e atrapalha o combo.

As dungeons são bem feitas, os bosses tem uma certa narrativa. A história embora repleta de clichês é interessante a ponto de entreter e nos deixar querendo saber mais. Sobre o PvP  não tive muito contato.

No geral o jogo precisa ser polido, melhorias de desempenho urgentes se fazem necessárias.

Prós:
Gráfico bonito, cenários variados
Dungeons curtas
Ótimo Design Character

Contras:
Péssima otimização gráfica
Traduções de baixa qualidade (em inglês mesmo, algumas frases não fazem sentido)
Controle confuso (explicação mais adiante)

Pontos que achei relevante apontar positivamente:
Pets e Montarias domáveis
Raças variadas não-humanóides
Dublagem em todas as cutscenes
Variedade de Sets

Em relação aos controles, não é o pior do mundo. Jogo Guild Wars 2 a 5 anos e me acostumei a controlar a câmera em combate pressionando o botão direito. Vi no Bless a mesma mecânica de câmera, mas ela é muito mais falha, em combate o jogo ignora o botão direito pressionado por vezes, fazendo com que você perca o fluxo de combate e consequentemente a janela do combo (ao tomar algum tipo de stun, o jogo ignora o botão direito pressionado; coletar loot dos inimigos também causa o mesmo efeito).

No geral é um jogo ""ok"", a proposta é muito boa. Ainda há muito chão para ser percorrido, o lançamento teve seus problemas, mas tudo isso pode ser superado e o jogo pode vir a fluir. Isso se a empresa focar nos reais problemas e se comprometer em corrigí-los. Vale a pena a experiência de mente aberta.",False,1527651314,1527651314,True,3,52,0.730440,True

1.) The launch wasn't even as bad as some people make it out to be. I've been through much worse for much longer times (weeks in a few cases).

1.) Combat - bland, unresponsive (delayed)
2.) Optimization - horrid
3.) No customization - at all
4.) Have to hack INI to see some improvement but it's not going to fix the game.

The biggest issue was they locked the character creation on the full servers (which my guild has tried to get everyone on) and was stranded outside on a random server playing solo.

We were under the assumption that Bless was going to have a mega server cluster with multiple channels so that you could play or fight vs any other guilds in the game.

This suddenly changed the day before release with an announcement that there was going to only be mini servers.

Combine that with a terrible stability launch and multiple resets, server lag, and poor overall translation (and a tutorial I couldn't even get through due to a bug)  and it left a really sour taste in my mouth.

[b]My system:[/b]
I have had no issues running the game at 60+ FPS at all times and I have experienced no lag. 
I have: 
a 400MB internet connection
a PC with a OC i7 7700K, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD and a 1080 GTX video card. 

[b]Minor Issues:[/b]
The only issues I have experienced have been the bless loading screen (which I fixed by adding all .exe to my firewall including the battleeye client exe Bless uses) and the occasional server maintenance. Other then that, no issues. 

[b]What I like:[/b]
Combat is nice and fast paced (ranger gameplay) and I enjoy the leveling/pvp/taming a lot. I have yet to hit endgame or do high lvl PVP but from what I have expereinced, it is a good foundation for the game company to build on, if given a chance.

[b]My final thoughts:[/b]
Yes there are server and some performance issues. That is to be expected in both a MMO and an EA game launch. Anyone who played FFXIV Stormblood launch would know that what we are experiencing in Bless today is nothing compared to that. FFXIV had a single story quest that gated leveling and unlocking content 2 hours into the expansion. There were millions of people that did not progress for multiple days due to the bugged quest. Now ofcourse Stormblood is doing great, FFXIV fixed the issues a few days in and everything was fine. I could give a dozen more examples.

I would say to give Bless Online at least a few days to sort out the server issues. You gave 10+ other MMOs more time then that. Have a little faith in the MMO industry and give the game a bit of time to work its kinks out. Early Access is supposed to last 6 months and anyone who purchases an EA game needs to understand, your taking part in the final 6 months of developement. Not a polished final product.

After refunding the game I kept up with what the devs were doing, how responsive they were, and how open they are to the community. After seeing them address the server issues, issue a balance patch(it's not perfect but it's a good start), and continue to prove they are listening and actively developing, I decided to rebuy the game. Let me make this clear, this game has issues. There are community fixes and dev fixes actively being worked on, the Reddit, steam forum, and discord are extremely toxic. Personally on my second time jumping back in with realistic expectations I'm happy with this game. My wife and I are having fun and that's something no other MMO since Aion has brought us.

I wanted to love this so bad. I couldn't wait for it. That being said the english patch for the JP server has better translations than the official release.

I really hope this improves over the coming months but too many things stand out in this game as generic asian mmo and the quality of a free 2 play game in 2006.

DISCLAIMER. Im still very much learning the game. some info i quote is from reading and asking around rather than experiencign. Im sure you all have enough salt anyways. Till have my review with a grain as well.

I went into the game expecting to get an average dungeon crawler MMO with decent graphics and pretty waifus hoping there was actually enough to do OUTSIDE of dungeons in the game. 

Im reviewing the game completely disregarding the launch maddness and unoptimised stuff.

till now

Pretty waifus, Check
Pretty game, somewhat. its not BDO, but its not bad either.

but thats where the good pretty much ends

bless doesnt bring anything new/unique/spectacular to the table PvE wise.

its your standard MMO where the entire world is basically for leveling and after that its empty/devoid of much reason to go back except for a craft mat or 2.

so really. its pretty much standard of 'mmo's' these days where they call themselves mmos but are actually just level once and then que for dungeon simulators 2018. And theres already World of Dungeon craft and Dungeon wars 2 'MMO' 'eyeroll' that do dungeons much better.

CRAFTING. What there is, while limited, is decent. theres a sufficient amount of depth to keep someone busy. and on the surface, seems about reelevent enough to your characters strength to keep crafting profitable. Unfortunately its almost dependantly tied to mats obtained from dungeons, which is huge turn off for someone like me who would rather just take dungeon based instanced content and throw it into the gutter for saddam and osama's ghosts to torture. The one upside to it is that dungeons can be farmed solo as well as far as mats go.

COMBAT SYSTEM: On the best of days. i wouldnt like tab target. I still dont. But objectively. its ok. Im not sure how i feel about losing the ability to customise combos, but on the other hand, this way is much easier to balance for the devs. Right now, action combat is bugged and removed from most classes so ill abstain from giving any final verdict.

PEEVEEPEE

now here ill get actually a bit excited. PvP design is nice. Theres 2 factions, atleast from what ive seen. theres no level 45 killing newbies in lowbie grounds from their own faction. Im not sure if thats not possible in game (which would be nice) or if people are just busy leveling. But id hope its the former.

PvP over Elite farming is awesome. Im sure there will be some PvE guys who wont like it. But as far as im awarr, theres elites in non pvp areas too so they can have those.

disputed zone pvp is nice. Its also nice that untill you reach near max level, the PvP immunity items are cheap and easy to get. Its also nice that those items dont have 100% up time. so whales cant just make themselves immune to pvp in conflicted zones and cross faction 24/7

Getting xp and currency for PvP is awesome. IF its limited to conflicted and cross faction areas. I havent yet experienced BGs or 100v100s


GEARING AND ENHANCEMENT.

My feelings are mostly confused over this. Not because i dont get the system. but because of the mixture of both vertical and horisontal progression

farming high level dungeon to get bis. Pretty standard. get BIs. Enhance it to +15 which is extremely grindy to do, which in itself is fine. But ive already learned that further expansions will come which will make previous enhanced gear useless. I mean what.
Seriously. You go through WOW rng to get the gear, You go through BLACK DESERT RNG to enhance it, then do it all over again every few months cuz they release more powerful gear 'content' and your max gear is useless???? i really dont get that.... Theres no variety either stat wise. you have one set bis for each class. But then again the game doesnt really support mix matching stats for classes. Which isnt a bad thing at all imo. just is what it is.

The enhancement system itself tho is pretty much BDO as far as i understand it, just a bit less brutal. you have a sword. You can change its rarity (colour) and its 'level'. You can safely level up the gear up to level 10 i believe. then it can degrade. You can farm mats to stop it from degrading. Equipment has its failstacks. failstacks increase the chance to succeed. and GOD BLESS the enhancement isnt capped to a ridiculously low level. No failing 346 times and still being capped at a success chance of less than 10 percent. Instead it caps at 50 percent no matter what level you are attempting. Which is MUCH MUCH better than BDO. Id have hoped for caps not to be there in the first place. But whatever.

overall. Not reccommending the game. The game has one of the very FEW open world PvP relevent designs. reminds me of BDO's launch months without the lowbie camping cancer, which is AWESOME. In my mind tho, the Open world PvP is the only thing bless has going for it right now. and it wont survive too long with it imo.

Ill undoubtedly post a followup review once ive spent some time in endgame. Maybe even wait for some more content to come out

My advice. Stick to EvE online, the only MMO worthy of being called an MMO. or ESO. the second best.

or just play survival games. More MMORPG than most of the utter crap plaguing the MMO genre.

Sim consegui, depois 4hrs entre fechar e abrir o jogo, filas e mais filas, consegui jogar....  Ter um i7 + 1060 e rodar um jogo que usar DX9 e Unreal Engine 3 dropar mais fps que PUBG quando lançou. O jogo já é antigo e não otimizaram NADA dele, NADA NADA, na cidade no ultra dropava pra abaixo de 30fps.

Aaah, mas vc colocou no ultra... No low o jogo dropava pra 35 fps constante, isso que o jogo vem travado em 60fps se vc  n alterar o arquivo interno do jogo.

E a jogabilidade, o que achei?
Vc é obrigado a usar uma sequencia de skills (combos), se vc errar uma skill desse combo, ele reseta e se tiver em CD as skills, vc fica parado sem fazer nada só tomando do mob, ou correndo que nem uma gazela pra não morrer enquanto volta o CD.

3 - You have to ""fight"" other players for mobs or quest objectives, you can spend 15minutes trying to kill 1 mob from your quest... That's an archaic system and needs to be changed, Gw2 does it perfectly.
4 - Questing is the worst thing ever, SO GENERIC and dumb.
5 - Combat is clunky, the game does not respond well when you try to combo.

First 48 hours (founder 2 day head start) of the Early Access have been a little rough. Occasional server lag, disconnects, and difficulty getting into the game, but the devs have been very responsive and are actively working with the community.

There are some issues that are a direct result of Unreal Engine 3, such as objects loading slowly, and there are some questionable translations, especially in the tutorial but most of these will be fixed as time goes on.

Despite all this, I'm enjoying the game. There are tons of creatures to tame and the combat is interesting, and will improve as the devs have announced action combat will be returning for all classes after some more tweaking.

firstly i must say out of all the early access games ive played in the last few years this has been one of the better ones if not the best only one or two maitenances on the first night no real massive downtime on the first day. (roughly about 2 hours all in all it was down for on the first night for maitenances.) so i think its doing fine.

the game itself is quite fun theres a bunch of things to do nothing that hasnt been done before but still a variety and it doesnt feel like a massive chore. the combat is fun for a tab target game the combo system makes it interesting. i prefer this kind of combat to pure action combat because its not a a buttonmash fest and you have to think about what your using and how to utilise the stances to get the most of possible. 

the problems atm are quite normal for any recently released mmo and i can deal with that it will get better with time only problem i have which is just a preference is that some classes i want to play arent out. (mostly assassin) but thats not much of a problem ill just get familiar with the game till its out.

another issue i would like to pick up on though this failed in other regions and is a old game according to some its been tweaked quite a bit for us and they keep on tweaking it just have patience, i still feel like it has promise and i hope people give it a go because neowiz are actually really trying as a company to live up to what people here want which is suprising since i cant think of many companies who would actually go to the lengths they did to make this build of the game for us. it is similar but at the same time very different to the other builds it has in other regions i hope it has a steady success and helps people remember what mmos are for to have fun and enjoy the adventure be it pvp/pve or other.",True,1527647707,1527647707,True,0,0,0.000000,True

I won't go over the game's problems, because I think a cursory search of other reviews will paint the picture clearly. But the makings of a solid experience are planted here. They just need a little water from the devs to grow. As far as launches go, there has been worse, and the problems that are present here are easily fixed.

Time will tell if the devs are committed to supporting this game, and I hope they are, because there is some solid foundation to make something pretty fun here.

Day one: (first two hours) The game goes from the splash screen directly to ""Disconnected from the server""

After a frustrating 2 hours I finally figured that out. I then spent the next three hours being stuck on the title screen. I went to bed never even making it into the server que.

Day two: I get up early before work and try to get it running. I spent an hour on all kinds of fixes to get passed the title screen. It finally works! I go to make a character on the server with my guild, and that server is locked. You can't create any characters on it. So now I can’t even play with my friends. So I reluctantly create a character on another server and leave for work.

Day two (cont): After dinner I spend five additional hours trying to get past the title screen. Nothing works. I’ve spent ten hours with this game now and I’ve played for twenty minutes.  

If this was a beta then these types of things can be expected, but I paid for this game, and I can't even get past the title screen. I've seen some bad MMO launches before (DAOC, FFXIV), but in my personal experience this one is inequitably the worst. I'd wait a month minimum before trying this out.

Das Kampf system gefällt mir ganz gut erinnert mich an die guten alten zeiten mit etwas extra pepp(ist mal was anderes als immer nur action combat mmos die toll ausschauen schön flashy combat haben aber an content  null zu bieten haben)

Die Spielwelt und die charactere sehen echt nicht schlecht aus.

das game hat zwar seine bugs aber hey es ist Early Access klar gibts bugs

die server probleme werden auch immer weniger (gestern noch laggy und delays in quests und beim looten. heute schon viel weniger bis garnicht)

1.  The Community Reps are useless. 
Aside from Coffee, the rest of the crew is genuinely useless. Penta has given wrong answers several times and during server issues that effect gameplay, they don't talk to the community! During launch they shut down character creation on the first-born servers and didn't talk to the community about the possibility of a server transfer or way to help reunite guilds, so people quit in groups.   

2. The translation is machine-made.
Fan websites have a better translation of your skills than this game does. Why are we paying for a game where the JP-> NA port has a better/same translation?  Skills cost 5 gold per point to spec and that's a lot of a new player's money to try and learn how the skills and system work!  Because of this translation issue, they should have provided free resets to the community for a limited time, or until the translation was fixed.  When asked about this, neither Coffee or the CMs responded.

3. Optimization is terrible! 
Even people with high-end computers are running into frame issues in a game thats supposed to support 100v100s?  There are fixes for this where you can edit your .ini however there should have been more done to prevent this. Some of the settings should have been premade by the devs as well!

Its still in EA so action combat isnt fully implemented and they are still working on optimizations for newer hardware.  

Dont listen to all the folks jumping on the bandwagon of hate.  Like they said its EA for a reason.  optimizations, and yes the imfamous loading screen issue they will pin down shortly.  They also did make a mistake with only 1 server initially so everyone joined new servers, founders items got locked to certain characters.  They already put out put a ticket in and they will move to new character on a new server.  Company is doing everything they can to make everyone happy.

It has been a hassle getting logged in with the loading screen issue and with the queue on the initial server.  MOVE TO A DIFFERENT SERVER FOLKS.  its not rocket science.  The only issue i have to say is the extra cash for 2 day head start kind of sucked as were not really getting it. really the only complaint i have, but its not a big deal.  its an mmo release after all and the first one done by the people who actually make the game.  theres no publisher here.

The engine simply doesnt work, FPS drops are consistent even on a pc that can run BDO on 60 fps consistently, the UI freezes your computer consistently for small spurts for no reason, the windshields literally 5 inches from your face and trying to adjust it simply launches it into the stratosphere, and finally the game itself freezes like its going to win something.

Lack of optimization is not neccessarily a bad thing and shouldnt affect ones purchase, however with this game having been released previously it doesnt really scream GOOD THINGS at you while you play.

Bless online has some of the easiest leveling in the game, which is one of the only things I am pleasantly surprised by.  Most games with enchanting systems like bless have long slogs of leveling and enchanting to keep people around for years (im looking at you BDO) simply because they lack content.  Bless seems to have corrected this issue.  It is altogether possible to hit level 30 in around 10-14 hours while running dungeons and while it is boring it isnt neccessarily difficult.  The problem with this is that the game is so boring you may never want to find out what combat or pvp is present at endgame and if you are lucky enough to not crash every 30 minutes you might even get that chance.

Con(s):
 -Frozen title screen. People cannot get into the game so refunds are constantly being asked for. The timer counts down while you are stuck on the title screen, so there goes about an hr or more of the 2hrs you have for refunds. The good thing is, THEY CAN FIX THIS. Its only been the second day. (personally I probably have about 2hrs stuck on the title screen, but its been spread out.)
-The translations can be bad at times, but if you are in the right mood they can actually be quiet funny. ""5Level"", instead of Level 5. XD
-The chat filter is a little...off. But to me its actually pretty hilarious on what things are filtered and what aren't.
 (They can fix all of these things in the cons list, so its really not that bad.)
-Skins are a little expensive. 2600 lum. for a costume. The mount/pet skins are better around 1500 lum.

Pros:
-Devs seem to really be on top of things. They have already done a lot of fixes and added more servers. Haven't fixed the title screen yet, but I have faith.
-The game is fun! 
-There are so many mounts and pets to tame! And you get 40 slots for them. I usually get bored with MMOs fast, but because there are so many different tamable creatures I can see myself playing this for a long time. There are random chances of getting higher rarities when taming as well. So that adds some spice to taming~ ;)
-It isn't P2W. 
-39.99 is not that much money for a base founder pack when the game itself will be 29.99. With the updates, you will get your moneys worth in the end.
-No Required Subscription!
-I have a geforce gtx 960m, and the game plays decent (it was really good before the influx of players, but what can you do?) for me. 

Overall, I would say give it a shot! But maybe wait til they fix the title screen first. So you actually have a full 2hrs to mess around with it if it turns out its not your cup of tea.

The game is currently not in a state where it is playable. That's too bad, because I honestly did not think the game was THAT bad. I did enjoy some parts of the game.

However, the devs need to fix a lot of things:

[h1] Translation [/h1]
The translation is really bad. It's like the devs didn't take the effort to do the translations by theirself and threw everything in Google Translate. I even doubt that someone at their team even proofread the translations.


[h1] Optimisation [/h1]
The game is not fully optimised. It's runs like crap and it feels too clunky. You will only get (really) low FPS and you can't do nothing about it. People find fixes by changing values of a initialization file found in the game folder.
[i]Side note, the game has a FPS cap. To remove this, you need to change value of  bSmoothFrameRate to FALSE in the initialization file BaseEngine.ini to unlock the FPS cap in the game. Why wouldn't you add this to your settings Neowiz?[/i]

[h1] Loading screen of Death [/h1]
To even play the game, you need to surpass The Loading Screen of Death. You literally need to restart the game multiple times to even enter the game and select your character. Some people are lucky and only need to restart two or three times, but if your luck is shit like mine, you'll spend atleast 15 minutes restarting the game over and over again.

It's not gold or anything but it's a solid MMO. I'm impressed that it's not shit. 

There was a few burps and queues connecting, and some server maintence here and there, but once I got in, I didn't really lag at all. I expected it with the volume of people trying to play at once. It was reasonable to assume there'd be some connection problems, but honestly stormblood and archeage releases were wayyyyyyy worse than this.

The optimization has been drastically improved from the RU version. I am getting mostly 60 fps. Some places it's a little choppy but nothing major. I am not sure why others complaining about shitty performance, Im running very smooth.

Quests are voiced over and the voices are actually nice and the acting is decent.

The combat is nothing special, but nothing bad. It's also different and takes time to get used to.

There's no P2W in the shop. There's cosmetics, a pvp safe thingie, some pets and mounts, and a few EXP boosts, which some people may consider P2W but I consider it pay to go faster, which is fine with me. As long as nothing give stats I'm cool. Besides partying up gives exp boosts so no big deal.

[h1]To start, the game is no where near a finished product, which isn't bad, just be ready for a lot of in-game issues. This is my personal experience with the game as a [b]founder[/b].
Lets list some things about the game that I like:[/h1]

- Open-world PVP focused MMO with a touch of PVE content (dungeons for example)
- You can tame pretty much any creature in the game and ride/keep it as a pet
- A surprising well done combo combat system (no, it's not action-based combat)
- The game looks pretty good graphics wise
- Cash shop doesn't seem to have anything P2W
- Developers who seem to care about their game [as of the advancement playtime]
- Factions, just like in Archeage
- Voice acting (whether good or bad)
[h1]Those are just some of the more notable things I enjoy about the game, now for the things that I find rather ""dumb"":[/h1]
- Seems to be having a ton of server issues (not that I worry too much because it is the first week of launch)
- A few classes have been locked out when they are clearly visible as future classes that have already been released in other places (for example, assassin weapons STILL drop even though the class is not released)
- FOUNDER'S PACK ITEMS ARE FOR :b:ONE CHARACTER:/b: (hopefully this will be fixed in the future)
- Some ""lag"" occured when I first played the game, seems to be a lot better, but still might not be the best on certain user's systems
[h1]With that all said, there is certainly more I could touch upon, but these are the biggest things. Looking at the Steam reviews, it seems as if the community has given up on this game within the first two days, I personally am still supporting it, hoping the devs are working to ensure this game's success.
So, wanting to know whether to buy the founder's pack or not? The answer from me is no. If you were enabled to use it on multiple character or at the very least transfer the stuff from it over, i'd say it was worth it.

- DX9 optimisation is absolutely terrible. Fine for some, very bad for me. It sits on one CPU core and 8-10gb of memory while under-utilising GPU.
- Default config is a joke. You may need to tweak config files to make the game playable.
- Early access LUL
- Terrible translations, incomplete (and apparently inaccurate) tooltips abound.
- No severe P2W but there is purchasable convenience including exp boosts and pet related stuff, which can affect gameplay speed.
- Premium membership fee is high but it doesn't seem required at all.
- Game is fun which is a shame since I kind of wish I could remorselessly refund.

EDIT: But wait, there's more! I wasn't aware of the full extent of these before.

- Early early access (28th) may have been an anti-refund tactic as it's classed as a DLC.
- The game has released in three regions prior (KR, JP, RUS) where it has largely failed.
- Significant content, including the entire endgame, was supposed to be present but cut.
- The devs have very few excuses for the terrible localisation considering timescales and promises.
- The company are wildly making 'balance' changes which show they have no clue how the game operates.
- No, really. They nerfed everyone's damage damage by 70% in addition to buffing the healer class again. Paladins are unkillable & break pvp for now.
- A deeper look into the skill trees shows very little intelligent design.
- Combo system is fun, BUT it looks like a significant limit options, skill and variation.
-Premium currency (lumena) for a lot of advantages. Most won't use these but whales will be able to buy progress to a significant degree.
- Communist auction house. Prices are set, comrade. No room for capitalist dogs in this video game economy.
- Everyone has the same gear because there isn't any variation. Item drops come from a VERY short list.
- Premium membership exists to reduce in-game costs that are artificially present. Not having it will hurt your cash flow.

I had high hopes for Bless because I am a big fan of MMORPG's but I am sad to say it is absolutely not worth the money. 

Pros:
- Neat take of spellcasting
- Incredible character customization

Cons:
- Outdated visuals
- Not optimized (framerate/loading)
- Poor translations
- Riddled with bugs
- Game isn't stable (crashes/lag/freezing)
- Content is shallow and unoriginal
- Doesn't feel like a true MMO (most zones are riddled with narrow mountain passes/corridors)
- etc etc etc I could do this all night.

0,49,6,2694,2694,76561198034315642,0,english,False,42373781,"Okay so, I want everyone reading this to block out the crybabies giving this completely subjective negative reviews and actually read up about the game from someone who has played early access games before and generally has some kind of understanding about MMOs and how they work. 

I saw ""The Lazy Peon"", one of the worst MMO review youtube channels make a video on this game and his following kind of helped crash it down in a time when it needed people to have hope in it and boy did it not feel good to see how the game has been bashed considering it has been a pretty successful early access compared to a lot of MMOs I have played before.

I will start by listing the things I personally find good about the game and then its flaws in the current state. I really hope whoever reads this really takes an objective approach to the game and its current state.

This game (not the JP, KR or RUS version but this specific one) has brought back that sense of fulfiilment you get when you play a good MMO. The combat system overhaul has been great and I feel at home playing it as if I was playing Tera or GW2 with mixes and matches of other successful MMOs but made more crisp, more skill oriented, more enjoyable and much more easy to mess up combo wise for newer players. It is still a tab target MMO but mix that with the perfect amount of action and critical thinking and you get a fresh combat system. 

The taming system allows for you to be unique with your choice of mounts and pets since almost every mob in the game can be captured and made into a mount or a pet. This gives a huge variety of choice for people while leveling everyone on an equal playing field with the random skill system of pets. You can spend as long as you want catching pets and mounts until you get the perfect one for you, kind of like Pokemon with the 'got to catch 'em' all feeling.

The storyline is not as bland as expected and Neowiz now actually have done English voice-overs of dialogue (although there are a lines missing here and there >.>) but the storyline definitely at least keeps things interesting with different plot twists thrown in here and there and some pretty unexpected scenes happening around halfway through the storyline.

The character customization is very open and very free. You can pretty much make any kind of character you like. Just a few little details missing but very similar to BDO's

The animations and graphics of the game are above average although optimization (to be discussed below) is lacking at its current state. I would rate those around a 7/10 however, the sound effects and music add both eye candy and ear candy (if that makes any sense) and bump that up slightly due to the feel. The actions you perform in game can be felt as at least somewhat meaningful and you know that you are doing something game instead of having some weak sound effects feeling as if your character has no effect. I would say that the volumes may perhaps be too loud but that is just for my personal liking. I have the master sound turned down to 1 and headphones/soundcard volume at max.

Now... The bad:

Let's start with the translations. Very bluntly put, the translations are not very good. At all. They barely work as a guideline for players to understand what the game means but it seriously lacks effort. I can see how the poor translation can put people off but I would personally not consider that a huge problem as it can be fixed very easily if time is given. You get a pass on this one due to the circumstance.

There is not much customization in class specific skills. You just use a bunch of beryl or rose stone/blue stone and get some extra stats here and there but it does not seem very meaningful and gives little variety. There is a meta to be discovered and once that comes out, everyone will be using the same stat specs for each class depending on what they need the class to do. If Neowiz changes that a little bit or tweaks the system to make it less linear, I feel it would help players be more unique with the skill specs they choose instead of just boosting damage of x skill by x %.

The performance of the game is very poor as of right now. The game is a GPU memory hoarder and is poorly optimized for almost any PC. Most of us have manually changed settings in .ini files to fix the fps and make it at least a stable 30-60 fps. Without those optimizations, the game runs at a disgusting 10-25 fps in most areas. This can or cannot be easily fixed by making changes in the .ini files however the optimization itself must be made better in the future or more and more players will get frustrated and quit the game.

The graphics and UI themselves are barely satisfactory. An exact, on-the-dot 5/10. The design of the UI must be updated and made customizable! Currently, it looks very dated for its time and cannot be customized, made bigger or smaller as well as some UI screen just not staying up during movement. This should be changed some time.

There are also many bugs including a duplication bug which must die

Now the worst problem so far. Although the launch itself was quite good, the one thing that messed it up was the servers and the lack of proper space management for players. If Neowiz released founder packs a few days earlier to more accurately gauge the number of players who would play, they would have been better prepared to deal with the huge influx of players on day 1. Most of my guild sat in queues of 6 hours until suddenly, the main server was first faction locked (you could not join one of the 2 factions and eventually both factions were locked) followed by a character creation lock. The servers were overwhelmed by how many people were trying to play, to the point that around 5 servers had to be added to NA and (I am not sure how many exactly) around 3 had to be added to EU to compensate for the servers being locked so that more people were able to play and at least try the game out. 
This is a HUGE problem. By the time early access ends, players will see that some servers are character creation locked, aka, completely filled and could decide to not give the game a chance. Seeing how impatient most players nowadays are and the fact that they cry at every little wrong detail is an important piece of information to take in. 
My guild and I were also personally affected by that. As of now, the guild is split between various servers with no knowledge on whether servers will be merged into the Tanara, the main server, once they perhaps expand the server size or whether server transfer tokens will be given to us so we can all play together instead of sitting in voice chat together and feeling as at the fact that we all were split into different groups instead of being able to enjoy the game at its fullest, in good company and have huge amounts of fun together as we intended. Neowiz, you must fix this. This is very important for both the players and for you...

This is about all I can think of, off the top of my head. 
Once again, I would like to ask anyone who reads this review (or managed to get through all the babbling) to take everything going on with BO right now with a grain of salt. I trust that Neowiz will fix the game and make it into an amazing MMO some time soon once they get their thoughts together. Please be patient and give them a chance. 
To the developers: Do not give up and do not give in on making the game p2w. That is our last hope for BO.

And in these final words, I would rate the game itself a 7.5/10 because it feels fresh, even with all the negative things it has going on. It feels good to play Bless. Plain and simple. It may not be perfectly optimized, there may be bugs, the servers may be messed up right now but... keep your hopes up because the game looks promising and the game is GOOD. It is not just average like most MMOs that have come out and died within months. There is real potential here for a long term MMO to dedicate time to.

They are addressing concerns at record pace, and opened up 5 new servers very quickly to accomodate the growing player base.

This game is Early Access and also we're also on day 2 of launch, so expect a ton of negative feedback. Most of the people enjoying the game are busy playing it, not complaining in the review section or on Reddit.

Pros for the game so far:
Combat is unique
Leveling is interesting
Zones are aesthetically pleasing and so far seem to mesh up pretty well against one another
The classes all feel different and have different play styles

Cons for the game so far:
FPS hitches
Localization issues (translation isn't there yet {can't think of annny other games that had this problem *cough*aa*cough*bdo*cough})

Every single class moves and turns with ASDW, and straves with Q E, turning the camera with right clicks... except berserker, which inexplicably strafes with A D and has the camera locked to the mouse. This makes clicking several important UI elements which cannot be set to a hotkey a bit frustrating, and when a loot roll pops up your mouse completely stops controlling your camera until you bid on the item... even if you are in the middle of fighting a boss. This jarring transition got me killed several times.

Every single skill description seems to have been run through google translate and babelfish several times to the point where I have no idea what most of my skills do. There is an ability which can be upgraded to ""Increases the cooldown cooldown, but further reduces cooldown cooldown."" What???

Standard annoying MMO launchday issues of servers being on fire and crashing aside, the game is lacking any kind of interesting or unique draw.  Most MMOs you can accept that the first week's going to suck for playability.  That said, I didn't have many issues beyond server downtimes and a little lag.

I also did not have fun.

I've played hours and hours of Korean MMOs such as Lineage 2, Blade and Soul, Archeage, TERA, and lately Black Desert Online.  Each one, while not a GOOD game, had a lot of draws to them and enjoyment in playing them.  Bless Online is missing even a glimmer of hope that it will ever be a good game.

The combat is clunky.  The chains while seeming like an intersting mechanic are more limiting to what you, the player, is actually able to do in combat.  The animations are boring, static, and often times annoying.  The music and sounds of the world are altogether forgettable.  The graphics are 2012-era at best, and while bearable, had a severe amount of pop-in and oddities.

The game ran poorly.  I don't have the strongest machine in the world, but I can run most things at a mid-high level with a stable above 60 fps.  I ran at roughly 20 on MINIMUM in towns, 30-60 out in the world depending on if there was a single other player on my screen or not.  

I made it to level 21, having done the dungeon a few times to see what gameplay would be like.  I have never had a more generic, boring experience than that dungeon.  5ish mobs of very weak strength between each boss, with my ranger 1-2 shotting them.  Bosses dying in a snipe + another attack or two.  I don't expect solo content to be difficult, but I expected better from the first dungeon.

If you told me this was a badly made mobile game hurriedly ported to PC I wouldn't have been shocked.

[h1][b] Gameplay [/b] [/h1]
A janky buggy mess. Despite the game being titled as an Early Access game, Bless was announced in 2011 and uses the Unreal Engine 3. Bless has been out for over a year in other countries. 7 months in Russia, and a year in South Korea/JP (info according to the wiki, might not be 100% correct). The point is that the game should not feel like this with the years of development it got. 

The UI is atrociously large. It feels like a mobile game. The movement is janky/feels off. The performance is subpar. The options menu is pathetic – there is no way to turn off chat filters (words like HOW are being filtered to **W….srsly), and the graphic options are barren. The game ran at around 40-50 fps on my 1080+i7-4790k. The translations are subpar, noticed multiple spelling/spatial errors in the short time I played. The tutorial itself was hard to understand because of the directions given are very clearly written by someone not fluent in English. 

The biggest positive for me was the launch experience. I fully expect MMO launches to be utter crap, but after downloading (which required no patching), I was able to get in the game, after some slight troubleshooting with the launcher, within 15 minutes. No queues, no waiting. Also, the character creator was nice. 

[h1] [b] Graphics [/b] [/h1]
They are decent. The game is fairly old, and Unreal Engine 3 is a good engine, just not for MMOs. Still the FOV felt too restrictive, and the graphics felt generic, uninspired, and dated. 

[h1] [b] Audio [/b] [/h1]
Amazing. Hans Zimmer is the BEST part about this game. 

[h1] [b] Final Verdict [/b] [/h1]
I strongly recommend giving it 6 months while following the game to see what happens. As it stands in its current form I cannot recommend it due to the gameplay that is surpassed by older games. Unfortunately, stick with WoW/ESO/BDO and the wait continues for the upcoming Pantheon, Camelot, or Crowfall. This assessment is only on 2 hours of gameplay due to choosing to refund it, so this might change as players progress into the game, provided they can endure the initial controls/feel of the game.",True,1527642613,1527643137,False,0,2,0.523810,True

My frustrations with the game stems with how they handled the launch.  As one of the players that logged on exactly at game launch, downloaded the game and was pigeonholed into playing on the only 1 US server available, i eagerly accepted my founders pack loot and began questing.  shortly after the first sever issues arose when a quest was bugged out literally causing 100's of players to stand around a shady hotel room nightstand trying to find ""don chicos"" journal.  After a while and constantly spamming F, I was able to continue on my quest.  There was then about an hour-long maintenance, which I can only assumed fixed that problem, and the game was down and new servers were created for NA.  I contemplated starting a new character on a new less populated server only to learn all the founders pack gear I had on my original character could not be transferred... I was then attempting to play and was put in a queue of 3000.  you read that right... 3,000 people for the original server, one that most people were not hamstrung to.  I chalked this up to server new release pains and that ended my session for the day (I was in the queue for about 30 minutes and the number of people in queue actually went up)  I looked forward to putting some time in today after a trip to my office and to my shock I was greeted with another queue of 1600 plus individuals.  After much disappointment I decided to reach to stream to request a refund.  At the time the game dashboard stated I had about 12 hours of game play and I probably was in the game for about 3-4.  The rest was in queue and attempting to navigate error messages.   The founders pack was meant to allow early access to a game that clearly was a work in progress.  My only ray of hope that is in a couple of weeks they will fix these problems but in its current state it is unmarketable to me and not worthy of the proceeds they are asking for.  A group of friends and I also had issues trying to create characters and play together as servers were locked randomly throughout the day as well as factions being blocked out.   I was very pleased with steam and their customer service as my full refund was issued after only a few hours.  My honest advise is that if you are a casual player with playing hours that are similar to the majority o the working force (Window of 4PM to Midnight) you will be frustrated to no end trying to connect to a server with a queue of hours to play, only to get DC’ed somehow and have to go through the process again.

First the bad:
Unfortunatly, its more than a bad launch. Its a full on lack of followup with what was advertised.
Instability, hell 3 mintues in you see proofreading errors in translation, System preformace is off the walls. High end systems chug at <30. Low end systems run decently oddly. The promises of there being no pay to win. While there is no direct pay to win, the cashshop grind is real. $10 for a single row of bagspace for example. Cash shop currency to get a faster resurection? Yep... Crafting/exp boosters. Again its there. Sure there are skins and cosmetics. Hell, the ""founders"" packs contain skins, with the limit of them all being 30 day. So you get a CHARACTER BOUND subscription item (yes, its per character not account). some temp cosmetics, and a 2 day head start. Worth money? No.

The Good:
Combat is fun! Skills are intresting, and feel smooth to combo and swap between specs quickly.
Taming creatues as mounts, and pets is a really neat little gimic. You see a cool creature, chances are you can tame it. 

The Ugly:
Login Queues... Aside from hype. at first there where 2 worlds, slowly they added more. Still looking at 2-4 hours to attempt to log in.
Character Restriction. Made it past the queue? Hope you can make a character on your groups faction. Too many players on the other faction and your locked out. Only way to swap it requeue and try again.
Pay for convience - Some things are convince, sure. But the publishers have clearly seen that microtransations make money and if you can do something for a price, its in the cash shop.
NO PLAYER TO PLAYER TRADING. If you come from BDO this is normal for you now. But give that items for classes that are not coming with release are dropping its kind of silly to think that your only way to trade is a client regulated Auction house that sets min/max.",True,1527641834,1527641898,False,0,2,0.500000,True

Combat

The new combat combo system is great, I find it flows well and provides a good skill/fun balance.  The concept is simple building up a tree of combo skills based off initial opening skill.  Combine this with stance switching and build combinations and it is very promising.

Graphics

For an old engine the game still manages to look nice.
Performance is limited due to a badly optimized dx9 UT 3 engine.  I'm afraid of how bad FPS will be in 100v100 battles.

Content

Its hard to comment too much on this because queue times being 90% of play time mean its impossble to experience the full game in its current form.  So farm I have enjoyed the dungeons and open world content.

The lore is good, unforunately to get the T rating the story has been sensored.  In my opinion all MMORPG should be marked M or higher because of the player base.

Worth picking up?

The obvious comparison and competition being BDO, both are endless Korean gear enchantment RNG hell. Bless has some actual instanced dungeons. Bless also actively rewards you for PKing instead of punishing you for it, since rather than a guild system where players make their own PvP battles with a karma system for random PKing, it's faction-based like WoW (what year is this again?).

The UI is comparable to TERA's. In that it's bad. Freeze your game for several seconds if you haven't opened a certain window in X minutes bad. It's hard to navigate, there's about a thousand different things you have to do for something that should be a right-click from your inventory to feed your horse, and there's seemingly a few thousand different things for you to unlock in the ability/passive progression system using three separate currencies.

Optimization is some of the worst I've seen outside of unity asset flips. Hope you like everyone sliding around in their underwear t-posing, because you're going to see it a lot. Framerates are unstable at best, and consistently low on a good day. I should not have to look up instructions on reddit regarding editing .ini files to get acceptable performance out of a game.

Graphics are alright. They're far from amazing by today's standards and UE3 is showing its age here. Very reminiscent of TERA all around. Some textures (particularly eye makeup for some reason) have some REALLY low resolutions. 

Gameplay isn't bad. It's clearly designed as a tab target MMORPG and then they couldn't figure out what to do with it and tried to make it TERA. It's playable at least. Hope you also like your horse dismounting you because it ran out of energy for the 10,000th time. Same with pets (which don't seem to do anything? I thought they were supposed to auto loot but they haven't been doing that for me either). There are craftable items to restore energy faster, no doubt the original plan was to have cash shop items do this.

While the P2W cash items are not nearly as bad as some other games (even BDO is worse in my opinion), it's still got some tangible, objective benefits for people that pay past the entry point compared to those that don't. For the most part, you're looking at EXP boosts and cosmetics that do nothing beyond alter your appearance.

There are a few good points... Character customization is quite good - Better than TERA, not quite up there with BDO. Well, there's one good point anyway.

tl;dr TERA is free and has a more fluid combat system. BDO costs a third of the price of this game and has better everything, though if you're the type to pay extra for a game BDO will easily be the most expensive of the three. TERA being a close second.

Dated graphics, some of the worst English voice acting this side of Croatia and more than a few dated mechanics and many questionable design decisions bring this game down in a bad way.

第二次伤害改动出来了。缩短了个别职业技能CD, 法师大众所抱怨的冰指技能CD从0秒延长到7秒（避免无脑，以及PVP的强势风筝。）
野怪以及副本野怪血量减少20-25%。
连击增益增加, 6连击可以增益80%dps。

现阶段问题还是大体相同，
射手 （Ranger）缺少高伤害, 等待下周技能伤害改动。
Guardian, Paladin 还是较强, mage少了冰指, 但原本输出就不差. 三者职业较为平缓。
Guardian作为tank，缺少群拉仇恨技。
Paladin作为治疗, 治疗技能加入连击技, 众多玩家感觉到不适应感。掉血是一个比较随机的事件, 有的大治疗, 需要前面放两个小治疗, 这期间的施法时间, 可能T就倒了。
Berserker 伤害可以，但技能节奏太慢, 缺少一些填充技能.

下周会有进一步的伤害改动，会直接涉及到技能伤害改动。有待研究。
2018/6/3
Devs声明会在下一周发布新的伤害改动，具体如何有待研究。
现行的伤害补丁, 让我跟几名玩家研究了下。 现在已骑士为例, 大多数玩家还不知道连击可以达到6连击。 Guardian甚至可以打到8连击。在之前的伤害补丁, 基本大多数玩家以为连锁技只能打到3连, 4连。
连击的伤害加成大大提高, 这是由于姿态互相切换, 造成连锁技可以延续。实测 6 连锁的伤害高达 3 连锁的两倍 （骑士）。以前因为伤害太高, 技能连击根本用不上多少来让玩家思考输出循环。这次伤害改动和6连锁以上, 让众多玩家重新思考输出循环。
骑士(Paladin)现在体验普遍良好。 地位最差的现在应该是射手（Ranger），以单体输出为职业核心, 但现在不管是输出还是走位都差其他职业一大截, 现不推荐新人玩这职业。

2018/6/2
游戏经过一次玩家伤害patch
[h1]缺点[/h1]
各职业伤害降低比例70%左右
整体PVE节奏环境下降(落差大)，由1套连击一个怪(不超过5秒)，演变成数套连击一个怪(本人骑士为例, 1只怪要打将近20秒左右), 低级玩家做任务，打怪，打本总体难度上升。

[h1]优点[/h1]
原来PVP环境，由Guardian和mage为首，基本无人为敌。 补丁后，伤害比例大幅降低,技能连击量加长,环境良好。各职业加强移动/躲闪/自保技，PVP环境下,战斗更加灵活。

总结, 补丁大方向是对的, 但对于pvp和pve的划分应该更加明确,此次补丁明显很粗略的降低各职业伤害, 还需要大改动。
现不推荐新人尝试, 等后续补丁更进。

最初评测
游戏是老游戏了，不过欧美服大改了，没有什么RMB玩家因素。
[strike]根据Bless reedit和玩家反馈，游戏时间超过30小时都有成功退款的情况.[/strike]
听玩家反应，前两天head start已过，超过两小时基本不能退款。
除非很感兴趣，不然不推荐入手。

[h1]缺点[/h1]
1.刚开服，服务器承载不行，基本所有网游开服都这样
2.游戏优化不好，顶配电脑也没法稳定住fps，不过可以通过改客户端文件，大大改善fps，但也只在80-100fps徘徊。
3.刚开服，很多都需要抢怪，独狼很难玩下去

你可能会面临频繁掉帧，服务器延迟，拾取延迟，对话延迟。 这些都是网游刚开服的典型情况。此外，游戏优化本身不行，如果介意fps的话就不建议你入手EA阶段了

[h1]优点[/h1]
1.大改后的欧美服战斗连击系统，完全可以说有一半以上功劳救活了这个游戏。游戏的节奏大大加强。 同时因为各种连锁技，操作难度相比日韩服提升很大。
2.职业可以从6个姿态里，选择两个装备，战斗中可随意切换。提升了职业的多样性。我以自己骑士为例，选择了一套奶姿态和dps姿态，在pvp和PVE中可战可退。
3.相比日韩服的技能释放无聊的1234，欧美服独有的连锁技演变成1>A/B/C>a/b/c, 2>A/B/C>a/b/c,3>A/B/C>a/b/c，同时因为可以随时切换到第二个姿态，两者连锁技可以相辅相成，当然操作难度大大提升。
4.游戏是PVPVE，官方照顾到两方面玩家。

战斗系统很有趣，给游戏大大加分，现在个人等级即将30级，很快就进入中立区跟对立阵营抢土地所有权了，个人还是会继续玩下去，帧数在改了文件之后，倒是相对稳定。

Warning！如果你电脑没有gtx1060左右就不太建议玩这款游戏了，掉帧会让你很难受。 你可以等游戏正式发布之后再考虑。

你如果硬要玩下去，后面估计也是妥妥差评了。不管游戏潜力多好，如果电脑玩不了，也没什么用。

Some have legitimate grievances about the way the game launched into early access (which I will address), but the level of vitriol and froth expressed is less about expressing concerns in a constructive fashion that might further a game they wanted to like and more about crowing over a game they never wanted to succeed in the first place.

First off, to say the early access release is rough is accurate. It's rough. I truly believe if Neowiz had come out and been more forthright about the state of the game, at least some of the anger could have been quelled in advance. The problem here is that expectations were not set up correctly on behalf of the developer and community alike.

Some of the problems include:

- Server crashes/disconnection issues
- Server load problems where quests/looting would not advance properly or lag severely
- Optimization issues even for high-end systems
- Poor translations at some parts of the game
- Action mode being disabled for all but one class
- German translation is actually English

Some of this is to be expected when any game launches. It's not ideal, but it is forgivable. Other MMO launches have seen at least some of these problems, after all, and were produced by companies with a much larger budget. Others, however, do have some community members rightfully upset; after all, one of the first quests you see in the game that teaches you basic skills is nigh-incomprehensible due to unacceptably poor translation. Frames grind to a halt, even after lowing graphical settings. Previews of classes gave an impression of combat that was not fully accessible at launch.

That having been said, torching the world down around this game and calling it a cash grab and parroting talking points about Asian MMOs is disingenuous to what the game DOES offer. Here are some of the highlights:

- An absolutely beautiful world with attention to architecture and detail nearly everywhere you go
- A quality character creation process that rivals Black Desert Online's
- A mature storyline that includes questioning morality in a post-oppression regime, the discovery of one's mortality, and the formation of government.
- An interesting 'rhythmic' combat system consisting of chaining combos
- A taming system that allows you to capture and improve a number of creatures you encounter in the world
- A cash shop that, thus far, does not feel exploitative or overbearing

It's missing some quality of life features; for instance, its support for roleplay at current is poor. The chat limit ought to be increased significantly (50 characters is not enough for anyone, much less RPers), there is little emote support, and you cannot sit anywhere in the world. But the good news is, the game is still in early access and is expected to remain that way for several months. The devs have proven responsive to community feedback, which is why it's important to do more than yell ""dumpster fire"" with a thumbs down. Ragebombing reviews is a popular outrage tactic by the current MMO gamer communities, but hopefully substance will rise to the top. If this game fails, it deserves to fail on its own merits rather than because the hivemind yelled some uncreative variation of ""Asian MMO cashgrab P2W dedgaem"" enough times.

Overall, this game has a lot of promise, but the community is utterly disinterested in a modicum of reason before they torch yet another MMO and accept no responsibility for their part in a barren MMO landscape.",True,1527641600,1527641600,True,0,0,0.000000,True

This game has failed 3 times in different regions, it is an ""early access"" game but not a new game guys. There is no reason this company couldn't learn from their mistakes. It's simple, they are thieves who just want your money. 

I already refunded the game after 18 hours of play. About 9 of those hours was me just waiting in the queue and another 2 hours was me trying to get past the Bless Online title screen. Yeah. You have to actually alt+f4 and quit the game and somehow have RNG bless you to get past the title screen; there is no workaround it. After that, if you had friends you wanted to play with that were already in a server, most likely you were locked out of that server and cannot play with them ever. That is because they stopped allowing characters to be made in that server for whatever reason. These guys are liars, remember how NA was supposed to launch with 1 server and was confirmed by their official Twitter? There is about 6 servers now after the day and no channels. Good luck trying to play with your friends because fuck you, Neowiz goes back on their word. 

Once you're actually in the game, like many other reviews (theres a reason why everyone repeats it, because its true) the translation is half-assed at best. The skill tutorial is something you just have to guess through since it won't be the name of the skill for your class. Took me quite a while but got through it eventually. While you're playing, you probably notice the frame rate is terrible even though your rig is good. You have to manually change things in the .ini files to make it run even remotely smooth. Theres even a guide to doing it yourself (in 2018 mind you) on the subreddit. The most I got was 150fps in an instanced dungeon playing alone, which was great, but why would you be playing an MMO alone? In the town and outside dungeons I fluctuated between 9fps to 60fps every second. That part wasn't too much of a bother to me but I also had to ask myself why did I need to do this in the first place. As you play you'll notice the global chat having a lot of censors in it. Their language filter is hilariously bad. Even their in-game GM messages are censored in some parts with words like ""cau**"" (Cause, 'se' is profanity?) Again, minor issues that should have been checked. 

If you actually read this far, you should be discouraged from buying this game and you should be. But I will end this by saying the combat is decent. There's combos like Blade n Soul and auto-pathing to quests like in Black Desert Online (you will get stuck on a bush and never move though). That might be why some people enjoy it, but its nothing new. I did not reach end game so I cannot comment on that. The tab-targeting issues and action camera is a big complaint on the subreddit, but since I played a Berserker I did not encounter those but you should read more on it yourselves. The character creation is also pretty nice, again similar to Blade n Soul. 

TL;DR: IF you can ignore (poor optimization, plain MMO experience, RNG logging in, etc.), then go ahead and play it because everyones idea of fun is different.

THE GOOD:
I can't say there were any for the only hour I was able to get in without getting stuck on the loading screen. 

THE BAD:
Well where do I begin? Oh right the huge hindrance of the splash/loading screen where I would say 80-90% of the player base in the US got stuck on. 
I spent 3 hours trying to get past it and was able to successfully get past it twice: Once during the first day where I then had to sit on queue behind over 5000+ players as they though it was such a good idea to just have three servers. So an emergency maintenance happened to so quote and quote mitigate the issue at hand with the server and the splash/loading screen issue. As the servers came back up more servers were available but the most important issue was never addressed nor was there any word from the developers on where the issue at hand stands. It mainly pointed out that the maintenance was over. The second time I was able to get on was today, but not after multiple trial and errors with having to ""resize"" the client before launching as this supposedly resolves the issue according to other steam and reddit users. Other than that there isn't any actual fix but to just keep trying until you get in. 

Now onto the game, lag spikes were horrendous to say the least, and the translations were off, if it weren't for the map one would be at a loss on what to do or where to go. After that hour I somehow just got disconnected and could not get back into the game again as I was facing the same troublesome splash/loading screen nightmare. 

Now would I recommend this to anyone? Sure if anyone wants to buy a splash/loading screen simulator it's a fantastic program.

After learning that this is not the first time they've tried to launch the game in a new market, there are glaring issues that NEVER should have made it to early access, if you can even call it that. 

Terrible optimization, poor translation issues (so bad that the tutorial quest for slotting skills on your bar talks about skills you don't even have yet), and their insistence at opening up servers when they see queues start to rise makes this nothing more than a cash grab. Not because the devs don't care, but because there won't be enough players around long enough for it to turn into a mainstay. 

If you are craving a new MMO experience, while this one is seemingly new and fresh, it's not really anything we haven't seen before. Basic crafting professions, basic combat classes, basic mount and pet energy mechanics. It's the same eastern MMO we've played before, slightly altered in a way to look new without really being new. Gear enhancement and destruction is present, along with the promise of action cams being brought to every class eventually so you don't have to tab target. 

All in all, when the game runs, it runs well. Spells look amazing, same with the zones and open world. But at the end of the day, that's really all it does well. And the truly sad part, it does absolutely nothing new. 

4/10 at best. Maybe bump that up to a 5.5 if they fixed a whole host of game bugs and issues, but I doubt that'll happen anytime soon. Please don't waste your money on the 'upgraded' versions of the game, unless you have the cash to spare. Pick up the game for 40 if your not sure you want to stick around.

Assisti milhares de vídeos no YT do gameplay do jogo no servidor Oriental e tudo parecia ser muito intuitivo o combate parecia ser excelente más isso caiu por agua a baixo quando depois de muita espera joguei bless online.
A primeira má impressão é o mau desempenho em máquinas capazes de rodar jogos muito mais belos graficamente que o bless.. Lógico que os desenvolvedores vão resolver esse problema conforme o jogo for se solidificando.
Outro ponto negativo ao meu ver foi o modo de combate muito travado, diferente daquilo que pensei ser ao assistir os vídeos. Os comandos demoram a responder e isso com certeza se dá devido aos 150 ms de ping em média do servidor Norte Americano.
Também particularmente não gosto de jogos Quest Based e mesmo sabendo que Bless é um quest based ele se mostrou muito hardcore nesse quesito, pois logo de inicio o jogo te coloca numa infinita jornada de : fale com ciclano, volte e fale com beltrano, volte e fale com fulano. Ao inves de no ínicio o jogo tentar te empolgar ele faz ao contrário com essas missões.
Não ha servidores na america latina e como ja disse acima isso atrapalha um pouco o combat action.. e uma tradução em portugues brasil seria bem vinda

0,12,1,607,607,76561198132017011,0,english,False,42373007,"A joke of a game. Performance issues even with  1080 Ti. Only time game runs at 60 fps is inside solo dungeons. In the world, you're gonna be noticing a lot of micro-stuttering and random freezes from time to time. Another problem with the performance is all the random game crashes (every hour or so). 

The combat feels very clunky and ""unrythmic"", a lot of spells lock you in place and makes it almost impossible to dodge spells from bosses. You can't fast combo your abilities and it feels like playing with 500 ms. I honestly feel like the devs have never experienced any other MMO's because this is by far the worst experience I've had with another MMO. 

Another problem I've noticed is the user interface, this is by far the worst interface I have seen in a modern MMO there are zero options when it comes to UI customization. Some examples being, you can't resize the map, you can't scale down hot bars or inventory, cant change size of the chatbox. I wouldn't mind all of this if it didn't take up so much space on your screen. 40% of the screen is being filled with things that take away attention from important things. The thing that tilts me the most is when you try to acess the in-game action house, which opens a web browser in the game and sometimes doesn't even load, and on top of that there is absolutely no functionality with the auction house. It doesn't even have propper sorting options.

Best way to level is to solo the same dungeon over and over (untill you hit level 33). 

Graphics looks like they might have been impressive back in 2010 but for a game in 2018 it looks more like a mobile game. I'd even go as far as saying it would have still been unsuccessful if it released in this state back in 2012. I know there's a lot of you out there who are super desperate for something new, a solid alternative to the current MMO's. Unfortunately, I think playing blessed will most likely make you realize how polished the current popular MMO's are.

Ein paar positive Dinge:

- Der Character Editor ist wirklich einsame Spitze. Er kommt zwar nicht an Black Desert Online ran, hebt sich aber DEUTLICH von der Konkurrenz aka WoW oder FFXIV ab. Und ich hoffe, dass kommende MMOs ebenfalls auf diesen Zug aufspringen werden.

- Soundtrack ist sehr angenehm und auch die Spielwelt fand ich obwohl das Spiel schon ein paar Jahre auf dem Buckel hat ziemlich stimmungsvoll.

Wait couple of weeks and see how committed are NEOWIZ to make it better. Otherwise, I recommend spending that money on three indie game that for sure will make you have fun with friends.

So all prior reviews, and many of those that will soon follow, will reflect very little actual game play. There have, as is common with any release, been bumps in the road, but the devs have been very attentive and have performed maintenance several times to address issues. If there is blame to place, I would say it was short-sighted not to allow purchase at least two weeks prior to release in order to guage the population and allot server space accordingly. 

That being said, I have played Bless before in a fully stable environment and have been giddy about the release in the west. It is a beautiful game with a wide array of races and classes to choose from, with more classes slotted for release in the future. The taming and breeding system relies heavily on lifeskills, so those looking to focus on lifeskill play should be happy, and action combat mode (which has not yet been enabled for western servers, but will be) is very engaging. The combat system as it relates to chaining skills is unique and requires strategy - lots of fun to me. 

No game is for everyone, but if you're thinking of trying Bless Online and are still unsure, I recommend waiting for the launch tension to die down so that you can read some reviews of actual gameplay by those who stick around for the fun!

Greetings!

Hey everyone, we know that there has been server lag occurring on several of the servers. As such, we are going to temporarily restrict new character creation on the following servers starting at 11:00, 20:00 (PDT/CEST)
[EU] Daimon
[NA] Lilyanthes
[NA] Murabi

If you have not already created a character on one of those servers, you won't be able to create a new one. You'll be able to select the server, but you won't be able to proceed past the faction selection screen.

If you already have a character(s) created in the server, you will be able to play with that character(s).

Please remember this is a temporary measure to help achieve a stable, lag-free experience on all servers. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we know many of you are frustrated - however, we want to get the servers to a good place for everyone as soon as possible so are making this difficult choice.

For those wondering when these restrictions will lift for these and other servers - we can't say exactly when yet, as it is dependent on when the servers return to a stable place. Please stay tuned for more updates!

Thank you

I put these issues down in hope that the dev team will fix them.

- No Official Forum, just links to steam community Hub. Need a feedback forum so theyre aware of problems.

- Wolf Noises howling out Marta are so excessive its annoying. 

-  I havnt seen a repair warning at all. Plus you cant do it below level 13? Dont understand...

- Some of the quests arnt very explicit.

- Skill window doesnt really explain initially how to equip skills. ANd terminology, like the use of ""mount"" rather then Equip is weird. 

- Enhancing and Upgrading companions isnt really explicitly explained.

- How to get guild levels, guild exp, and how many members you can have per level isnt explained. 

-  Emotes arnt visible. 

-  ""Stones"" the gatherable, are very rare.... lol??

- The publishers dont seem very involved.

- When people level, people dont know to do ""Hunting Quests"". 

- The interface i feel like is causing a bit of lag.

- I did some suggested INI fix that made the game lagg so much less. Though i still have spontanious FPS drop.

- Dont understand why you cant use flight paths in areas your story hasnt reached yet.

- Unsure what the requirments are for pets to give buffs.

- No stamina bar for when you sprint.

- There are just some little problems leaving open doors to lack of information, some weird balancing, some unconventionality, etc. It can be a little problematic.

List of grievances:

combat system is obtuse
     key rebind doesn't recognize special keys on mouse aside from left,right, and middle
     hand positioning is wierd both having to use WASD for movement and going back and forth
betweeen tilde(for combat style swapping[essentially a different set of skills]) 1-5 and R, T, and Y

camera system is obtuse
     going under water washes entire screen with a blue filter when you pop back up, slowly fading back to normal
     camera focus is wierd, seems to be center of mass as opposed to chest or head
     using cursor can be tiresome since you have to hold alt for the mouse cursor to pop up, can't have a toggle as far as I know
     free camera movement, however when you die currently, you have to hold left mouse button to change camera direction... 
     
gathering is down right annoying (pay for 1 hours worth of pickaxe time to grind ore?!) or buy a shit ton of 1 use items

collecting pets/mounts is a dull experience
    very simple minigame of hit the spacebar, and yes, 1 use item for this too. being ash ketchum is boring. Just play Monster Hunter if you were swooning for this experience

Story/voice lacks emotion
     Still better voice and story than BDO, but... its shit and I'm not gonna sugar coat it

Paying for a flying mount to travel shoots you into the clouds while the game loads, removing any sort of immersion. Not cool at all

graphics are meh, but its 2018 and these people are using Unreal Engine 3 still despite throwing over 60mil at this thing
     character customization is good though I'll give it that. Not amazing, not bad, it's at a decent place atm.

currently questing is much like BDO:
     Click on guy, accept quest, auto travel to quest, kill/collect/escort, auto travel to turn in. yuuuuuuuuuuuuuuup
     dungeons are meh
     haven't tried pvp but I just couldn't play this anymore

1- First of all, download the game, hard mission, had do re-download game 4 times to be able to have the full file ( I live in Portugal, Lisbon capital and I have a very good internet)

2- 10 hours later of everything done, logged on, in 29th at 1 AM to be able to have a character on the EU server, before servers go down and they lock it, was able, BUT... yeah but, resolution tottaly crap, could only make the 2 first quests in tutorial before game crashes with some weird bug. tryed to relog 4 times and coulnd't pass after the launcher.

3- Today was the ending line for it. Tried to launch game 20 times, and in the 20 times got stuck at login image, the blue weirdo log in. Changed the resolutions 20 times, from full screen to borderless, and all the other ratio and sizes of the display. N O T H I N G. and the fun fact, wans't the only one having the same problem but other people, my friend, were playing. 


To sum up, please, next time dont realese a game with major bugs, yeah major, if you can't even log in why do you really put the game on? just to win money? Even if it was only on the 1st day, tday ( 2nd day of it) not even a patch to fix this log in problems, no answer to community and it's all fine in the Dev's world...

Bom, sou o Tunico do Canal Niggamer no youtube.

Outro ponto negativo do jogo, foi um BUG na tela de carregamento onde travaram diversos jogadores PONTO NEGATIVO 2. E por ultimo, mas não menos importante, grandes quedas de FPS na cidade principal do jogo. Mas nenhum desses erros é referente ao jogo em si, o que eu digo é que o jogo esta perfeito,  a jagabilidade nova é muito boa, e o sistema de combate tambem ficou muito bem feito.

3. Server and faction locks have prevented players from being able to play their desired faction or server. In turn, this has fragmented guilds, causing many to quit.

0,69,1,142,142,76561198018992712,0,english,False,42372432,"First off, i have to admit, i was hyped for the game after reading myself into it and ""accepting"" the ""old"" model, tab target and instanced MMOs. But in the current state, rather wait for a moment. 

TL;DR included down below.

The hype dropped along with the way the CMs handled the communication pre-launch, censoring is still ongoing.

I will keep it as objective as i can be, knowing the past of the game. Obviously i ignore the typical launch issues. Those happen with every game, recently Dauntless.

To the performance;
But now to the game, it failed in multiple regions already, it is using Unreal Engine 3 (Released around 2006-2007?) and DirectX9 (Released along side of Windows XP) So you can imagine how the performance looks like.
On an i7 8700k it barely utilizes 15% of my cores, most of it is on a single core eitherway. So Clockspeed > Core count for this MMO. Towards the graphic card performance; The frametime jumps across 5ms-170ms on a GTX 970 @ 1440p, even though V-Sync is enabled. The FPS drops down towards the low 20s at times, even on lowest settings, while doing nothing but starring at a wall. Some people i talked to have worse issues, some have less. 

To the game itself:
Unlike popular belief; this game is not Pay-To-Win yet. Lets hope the developers keep their word, unlike the developers of BDO that put pay to win elements into the game after a while. 

It plays like the typical 2005 F2P MMO you would expect. Rather stiff, tab target, themepark. 
The graphical side is obviously not on the highest note, as you can take out of the engine and directx version used. 
It offers an relatively open world with no in-between loading times, even though I would probably recommend using an SSD to prevent atleast some texture pop-ins or ""loading barriers"" once the pre-loaded area has been exited. 
The reworked combat is a hit or miss, you get a set of ""pre-made"" combos you can switch around with stances. Quite cool and switching up the rather dull tab target model. 

But the biggest issue i have encountered is the translation. Beside the performance and the UI, those are the biggest problems. 

The translation is horrible. And i mean it. The tutorial on some classes even tells people to put skills that dont exist into action bars. ""You are 4Level"" is also one of the funny translations. It is plain lazy.

The UI:
Playing on a 1440p screen, i am used to have small UI's, and i prefer those over big and clunky UI's anyway. But this game scales the UI to the size of my resolution. The Inventory alone is almost 1000 pixels in height. The UI is NOT customizeable. 

TL;DR
I wouldnt recommend this game to anyone in its current state. There needs to be a lot of polishing and the developer needs to keep their promises of keeping this game free of ""Pay to win"". 
The performance is a mess. Mostly utilizing a single core on an i7 8700k.
The UI is big, clunky and lacks userfeedback, it is not customizeable and may cause lags upon opening certain windows.

I understand why many people find it not to their liking. Bless is a very traditional MMO, bringing the player back to the days of Vanilla WoW and other similar games. It can be a bit hard going back to finding your own groups, being forced to interact with other players for almost all the content in the game, and skipping some of the modern MMO convience features.

Bless is not a game for those who like to be pampered, which is an ever growing demographic. You will find very little hand-holding in the game, and if you expect things to be delivered to you with little effort, then the game is not made for you.

If you are a fan of traditional MMORPG gameplay, you will almost certainly enjoy Bless.

There is still some launch issues being worked out, but these problems have been very overexaggerated. The game is easily playable to max level with little issue. While the polish is missing in a lot of stuff, there has been nothing for me that was gamebreaking. 

Pros:
+ Great traditional MMO that requires socialization.
+ Insanely nice, large, open world with diverse landscapes.
+ Best Mount/Pet system of any MMO ever. You will never have to turn to the cash shop to get the best looking mounts or pets in the game. 
+ The game has really nice looking armor obtainable from playing the game, which is a nice break from the traditional korean system of selling the best looking armors in the shop.
+ Good character customization, rivaling BDO.
+ Servers and game run pretty well, with very little issue after launch day (may require some file tweaks to get working properly.)
+ Devs are pretty responsive, having put out balance and content patch in the first week. They also are in direct contact with many of the leading guilds. 
+ For a Korean MMO they have done a really good job at not having any P2W in the game (we will see if this continues to be the case in the future, I suppose).
+ The game has a lot of content, even if it isn't all released yet. This means that the game will be getting a ton of this content coming out over the next year, which gives you a steady stream of things to do.
+ Has a pretty nice gathering/crafting system. In-depth enough to be interesting, but not too much to be confusing.
+ Very fun/competitve world PvP scene. The game mechanics encourage large groups of players to run around the world and fight over resources. Very, very satisfying getting into constant guild v. guild brawls out in the world.

Cons:
- Ingame translations are very bad, but is apparently the top priority.
- The Marketplace/Auction House is very bad, laggy and the poor translations don't help.
- The classes were too strong on release, but are now too weak after nerfs, and will be buffed again (weird logging in and doing 50%+ less damage, 25% more, etc).
- The new combat system is fun, but not really complete. I assume we got combat 1.5, which is the version they made while converting from the old tab targeting system to the new free form system which isn't in the game for any class besides berserker. Some classes have chain combos that are useless, or stances that are very bad.
- The cosmetic shop items ingame are similarly priced to BDO, which I always thought was a bit much. Fortunately, Bless is way less reliant on the shop for cosmetics than BDO.
- Some ingame systems have small bugs that can be annoying, but not really game breaking.

Overall, for traditional MMORPG fans (Vanilla): 8.5/10

For fans of the newer style MMORPG (Legion): 5.5/10

Even if you don't plan to play the game long term, for $30 it is a pretty good deal. Could get a few weeks or so content playing casually. It might be worth waiting a bit until things are more smoothed out and then give the game a go (maybe in a month or so.)

As an aside: Most of the reviews for this game came from people who never got past the tutorial. The issues they had have since been mainly resolved. Don't let the +/-% scare you.",True,1527637471,1528018735,True,0,0,0.476190,True

Bless Online is a mixed bag.

The game itself is by no means bad - it has some nice ideas, and in the current panorama of either themepark MMOs (WoW, FFXIV) and hardcore PvP stuff (EVE Online, Black Desert?) this title sits kinda in the middle. You have your usual quests and dungeons, while being also focused on open world pvp and good old faction rivalries that hadn't been seen since vanilla WoW.

Now, you have to remember that this is basically an indie game. It is self published, and the devs don't have the manpower that Blizzard or Square Enix do. 

You also have to remember that the game is actually YEARS old, and was out in Korea, Japan and Russia for a loooong time....and tanked hard in those territories, for various reasons.

Now, the devs re-launched the game in the West....not without hiccups.

I won't talk about the servers and the lag, as it's an MMO and if you complain about servers and lags during the headstart you probably never saw a MMO launch before. Truth is, the team has been stupidly responsive addressing the issues. It feels like they are really trying to do their best.

It is true that it is graphically unoptimised. Some .ini tweaking can mitigate the issues a bit, but I cannot deny that the engine is kinda bad - no matter how powerful your rig is, chances are you WILL have framerate issues when in large cities.

I would like to hope that the devs will do what they can to fix this, eventually.

In short, while by no means the best MMO ever, I would advise potential buyers not to be swayed too much by salty people who are throwing shit at this game simply because they are mad they could not play much during the headstart. Those guys are hardly objective.

Maybe wait a few days, see how things evolve, and decide for yourself.

As for me, I am enjoying the game and I would reccomend it if you are looking for some good old PvP action but without the hardcore aspects and excessive grinding that other PvP MMO offer.",True,1527637325,1527637325,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Die Performance des Spiels ist aus der Hölle. i7 6700k gtx1080 16gb etc, 15 fps in Städten und Dörfern mit ein paar Spielern in der Umgebung. 30-40fps wenn man normal im Questgebiet unterwegs ist und auf paar Spieler trifft. Es kursieren einige angebliche config.ini fixes welche die Performance verbessern ""sollten"", mir hat das nicht wirklich weitergeholfen, vllt 5fps mehr. Bless sieht grafisch bereits veraltet aus, und einige dieser config Anpassungen lassen das Spiel zusätzlich nochmals schlechter Aussehen, als spiele man ein SPiel aus 2002.

Bless Online ist generell ein Technischer Super Gau. Das UI sieht nicht nur schlecht aus, auch dessen Funktionalität und Einstellmöglichkeiten gleichen dem Stand von 2002. Das Game bietet noch nichtmal die Möglichkeit den STandartmässigen 62fps lock in den Einstellungen zu deaktivieren, oder die Kamera anzupassen, das geht nur über die config im Ordner. Und das obwohl das Spiel mindestens seit 2011 in Entwicklung ist und bereits in 3 Regionen released wurde bzw in der Open Beta war. Die Probleme des Spiels sind also schon Jahre bekannt, Neowiz scheint allerdings nicht gewillt zu sein die Coreprobleme zu beheben, vllt können sie es auch einfach nicht.

Das neue Kampfsystem ist im besten Fall auch nur eine 5/10. Die Chainskills sind alle delayed um ca. 0,5 sekunden um den Anschein eines wie die Entwickler sagen ""Rhytmischen Kampfsystems"" zu wecken. Letzen endes sind dieses Chainskilldelays nur nervend un das nimmt den flow aus dem bereits extremen schwerfälligen clunky Kampfsystem. 

Leute die ein ordentliches PvP MMO suchen sind hier ganz klar falsch. Die extreme schlechte Performance mit diesem extrem langweiligen Kampfsystem lassen Bless Online nicht gerade als PvP Spiel in einem gutem Licht dastehen. Performance und Kampsystem sind einfach K.O Kriterien für ein PvP Spiel. Sogar der Actioncombat Mode wurde ohne Ankündigung vor dem release rausgenommen, nur der Berserker hat zugang zu Actioncombat, alle anderen Klassen sind auf unbestimmte Zeit pures TAB targeting.

Ich weiß auch gar nicht weshalb das Spiel als ""early access"" titel gelistet ist, das Spiel wurde wie bereits erwähnt 3 mal in anderen Regionen released, es ist also nicht neu. Ich habe noch NIE ein schlechteres MMO gesehn in sachen Technik, Optimization und Kampfsystem. was Neowiz hier abgeliefert hat ist unterstes Level.

I started the game and the first thing i noticed is the camera and movement isn't as smooth as I am used to with other MMO.  I continued with the tutorial to see what the combat is like.  First thing I noticed is that my left click does nothing, it doesn't auto attack.  I started attacking the dummies using the hotkeys and noticed there combos it provided but it just seems so slow between combo attacks.

Based on the early access you need to be prepared for poor planning, overpopulation, connectivity issues, server maintenance, long queue times and just a bunch of shit that is bound to go wrong.  If you went into this game expecting to download at blazing fast speeds, install the game flawlessly, log into the server without any hiccups, create your character without issues, secure your unique name that no one else could have ever thought of (sarcasm), instantly jump in and start playing without any optimization issues then you set yourself up for failure.  

Should Neowiz have figured out some way to anticipate the population it received and allowed pre-downloading prior to the time the servers went live REGARDLESS of how many users warned them, including myself emailing their PR department, that they would undoubtedly experience issues.  Yes.  

With this game being out for over two years now in three other markets and failed, should Neowiz figured out a better way to optimize the game more efficiently even while running on DX9 and UE3 and not the latest?  Yes, but I am no expert game developer so there might be something more elusive in that area beyond my knowledge.

Were we sold on the idea that there would be ""action camera"" available for all classes in the game at launch?  Yes.

Is it unfortunate we have to wait 3 months and maybe 6+ months for Assassin then Mystic when these classes are available in other regions?  Yes.

Is it amazing they expected 1 NA server and 1 EU server and 2 channels each to be able to handle the thirsty appetite of the MMO community?  Shocking!

Should you give this game some patience and allow Neowiz, though sorely unprepared, a chance to rebound from another poor launch of a MMO?  Yes because what else are you going to play?  

-GW2, the game that kicks out content every 3-6 months and you finish it in a week's time, or their stale WvW that has barely changed over the course of history?
  
-Black Desert Online, do you have some more hours, days, weeks, or months to invest in the game only to erase everything you worked hard for in one click of a button or their amazing dev team ""balancing"" the game taking the game back to closed beta 1 status all over again?
  
-AA, another Fresh Start Server?!  Huzzah! Wait...it's happening again...

Come on, don't kid yourself.  If you expected this game to kill the game you were playing before this then you better give them more time to prove that so they can deliver what they advertised. At least they aren't telling you that your ISP is the problem for all your issues in the game, am I right?  They're communicating and trying to put out one dumpster fire at a time.  If you don't like the game and see all these signs as early warnings as a potential dead game then maybe you're right.  Or maybe you're going to be kicking yourself months from now when all your friends that did stick with the game through the problems but knew the Devs would eventually pull a rabbit out of the hat will tell you this game is a breath of fresh air.

Just based on what I have seen so far it's enjoyable but everyone goes through the honeymoon phase.  Do I recommend you at least try it but understand this game will have its issues in the beginning?  Yes.  If you want, give it a week, let the devs get everything under control and then try it out.

I got a full refund from Steam and was quite happy about it... But about 6 hours later, I went and paid for the game again. I want to see how this all pans out because deep down there is a good game, once all the layers of filth and dirt have been swepped away (this won't be a few days or weeks, this is months to year) this has the possibility to be a really enjoyable MMO.

1. You were only given the opportunity to purchase a headstart packet right during the time of release, no pre-purchase available. 
2. As a result of not being able to prepurchase, devs had no idea on the population that would be crowding their servers. Upon release, all hell breaks loose. People get stuck downloading, people get stuck on the famous 'BLESS' screen, or other technical issues. Couldve avoided SOME server instability or overpopulation issues by allowing a pre-purchase, or providing a beta/alpha/stress tests. 
3. Once you get in the game, QUEUE simulation time! 3400 queue that only seems to go up. 
4. If you're lucky enough, you get through the queue and can create a character on the server - HOWEVER, at this time, you just run into a bunch of servers that have character creation restrictions and you're left on your own and unable to join your friends in their server (In my case, Tanara). 
5. Would be nice if you could just create a character on another server until they resolve these population/instability issues, however NO COMMUNICATION on this issue or whether a complimentary sever transfer would be offered because of your negligence.  While other MMOs have had these issues too, they've properly addressed how they would resolve it by offering server transfers - Devs cant even provide this or provide those in  my shoes any assurance of compensation. 
6. So we get stuck just sitting for 2 days (during the PAID headstart) wondering if its safe to create a character on another server, or if youll be stuck in that server. I've asked reddit, bless online forums, and have even messaged Bless Online directly on facebook, and SURPRISE - no one knows, or devs dont respond.

Non capisco se la gente è veramente stupida, o visto che il gioco ormai lo ha comprato, vuole per forza che tutti dicano che un game sia bello.. 

Allora,

● Il gioco è stato lanciato in KR, RU e in JP... cosa significa?
Che hanno avuto tutto il fottuto tempo per ottimizzare un cavolo di gioco.
Inizialmente il gioco aveva un'altro tipo di combat system, che poi è stato cambiato (a quanto pare fa ancora schifo).

● Quello che a noi hanno proposto è: il Berserk ha un semi-action combat, ovvero muovi il mouse e la telecamera si sposta, le altre povere classi invece (non ho capito perchè) hanno un meccanica di 18 anni fa... tieni premuto il tasto destro, per spostare la camera Q ed E per muoverti in laterale mentre skilli e tutto ciò, senza il significato della parola SCHIVARE, puoi andare a destra e sinistra quanto vuoi zio, il colpo lo becchi e muto devi stare, ho visto cose assure, streamer fermi mentre colpivano i mob e questi ultimi a loro volta colpivano lui. DOVE STA L'ACTION?

● Il gioco è passato per KR, RU e JP, arrivato qui FPS cappati a 62, possibilità di cambiare FOV inesistente, grafica che per l'età che ha dovrebbe girare a 120 fps in 4k con una 1080TI, e invece ti becchi che per avere +fps, il fov cambiato ed altro devi andare nei files di gioco e modificare tu, e uno che queste cose non sa farle? Eh giusto si attacca al *****. DOVE STA l'OTTIMIZZAZIONE?

● Dall'annuncio della release non hanno detto nulla su quanti server sarebbero stati rilasciati, non hanno fatto nessun test per la stabilità dei server, non hanno dato possibilità manco di un predownload quindi chi era fuori a lavoro alle 19:00 non ha potuto nemmeno metterlo a scaricare ed essere subito operativo, chi ha la connessione dell'ante guerra quindi avoja ad aspettare, 4 manutenzioni in meno di 24 ore.

Risultato?:
1- Panico nella community italiana costretta a dividersi in server a caso visto che i server non erano stati annunciati e il primo in lista era pieno con una coda con più di 1000 persone.
2- Il gioco se non lo facevi partire come amministratore e modificavi il file di gioco con la risoluzione del tuo schermo si bloccava alla schermata principale senza possibilità di chiderlo con un ""Quit"".
3- Crash continui durante la personalizzazione ed in game, lag e drop di fps. (vi faceva schifo prendere server decenti? Ah forse perchè dopo il flop delle altre regioni avevate paura di spendere altri soldi inutilmente anche qui...)
4- Chi preordinava il gioco il 28 alle 19:00 poteva subito scaricarlo e giocarci al MISERO costo di minimo €40 pieni pieni eh (vi piacciono 40 euri pieni in tasca per un flop). Purtroppo però chi lo ha preso per giocarci il 28 invece che il 30 (giorno ufficiale) del gioco ha visto solo manutenzioni ed ore di fila per entrare in un server.

Sono curioso di vedere in EU/NA i 100vs100 a furia di crash e drop frame.

Avrei tanto da dire e con tanta rabbia... Ma meglio non continuare. Daiii fatemi vedere come difendete un gioco del 2011 forzaaaa..

Peace.

Edit del 31/05:

Non avete preordinato il 28 per prenderlo 2gg dopo a meno? Peccato che il gioco non si sistema in 2 giorni, per questo ha avuto 7 CAZ** di anni ma NIENTE, flop in RU in KR e in JP, gli unici coglioni a cui piace prenderlo dietro siamo noi, ci godiamo proprio. Forza sganciate 30 euro, cerca: Bless Offline ops.. Bless online > sgancia €30 (per un EA del 2011) > pagaaah con Paypal.
E SPERO CHE NON TI RIDIANO MAI I SOLDI INDIETRO, perchè gente che lo difende così senza ragionare non merita di riaverli indietro *sputa*.

The Collectors edition bundle failed to mention that some of the items, the pet skins basically, are not permanent, they have a 90 day timer on them, after which, if you want them permanently you will likely have to buy it from the cash shop.  

They also drastically increased the cost of Inventory Space in the cash shop according to other users, likely to cash grab. 

The game was supposed to be what, the 4th try?  They promised and told us the Revamp would fix two key things.  1. The boring Combat, and 2. The optimization.  Well guess what?  They had to take away the Action Combat toggle promised to us from all classes but Berserker, for until the forseeable future could be god knows how long.  

Optimization? Lol......the game uses less than 20 percent of my CPU and GPU sources, its the same Unreal 3 bollocks as per usual, they did nothing to optimize the game, you have to pretty much go into the Ini files and manually change everything yourself and even then alot of users with GTX 1080 TIs and 7700k/8800k cores are reporting less than 50 frames while in cities.  While others seem to get 200+ for whatever reason.

TUTORIAL AND SKILL TOOL TIPS THAT WAS DONE IN GOOGLE TRANSLATION.  

I kid you not, the tutorials and quite a few tool tips, are done in Google Translate.  Therefore you have to rummage around to find out the right skill to use or the correct thing to do.

Cons:
FPS issues

Terrible translations
Unintuitive UI/can't move it
AWFUL voice acting, would be better without

So if you wish to decide to listen to the hate/negativity that people envoke that's entirely onto you, however, here's my take on this game. As of writing this, I'm achieving level 30. While quite not endgame status, it's close enough that I feel as though I've gained enough, as a first timer in this MMO, that I can make this review worthwhile. 

The Story

The questing system in this game is actually quite a relief. In focus of the main story, it doesn't really partake to other MMMORPG's ""filler"" quest within their story. Over the years of playing multiple MMORPG's, there seems to be a kink where the main character, yourself, is bound to have these ""filler"" story quests which are seen as endless grinds. Personally, the story in this game is actually quite through and through. They focus and stick to the content given at hand and reject such filler quests only to be given to reside in side quests - and even those aren't as bad as most. ""And what about the side quests?"" you ask, well there are lots to keep you preoccupied. Though most follow the standard, go here, get this, come back, or the other, go kill this and get rewarded, there is a more... short feel to them. For example, instead of killing 300 orcs, you only really need to kill like 10, if not 5 and the quest is done. This not only makes it beneficial for the player to take them up, but also since it's in the residing area of where your story quests are, I feel as though you might as well pick them up and get one massive exp boost along with it - which in itself is rewarding. Also, the tutorial quests given reward you with bonuses - as long as you can follow the broken english - unlike most other MMORPG's who just guide you through without much of a reward of accomplishment, a neat feature. There are also hunts in this game, much like FFXIV does, where you partake in killing a certain type of monster. Although their approach is rather different, it makes of a means to once again feel this level of accomplishment, a neat feature. Overall, the way that NeoWiz took on the questing system of this game is fairly decent and I'd give it a solid 7/10

The Sound

The music in this game is reminiscint of that of Guild Wars, or even Guild Wars 2. Though I have not personally taken into account all the tracks they have, the sound quality I will say is of similar taste, very fantasy and yet medieval. The sound's in this game feel par to that of any other top MMORPG and it's a good quality to have. In terms of the voice acting, it's really well done. If you ignore the animation sync with most of the actors in some cutscenes, the voice acting is actually quite decent for this game. Overall, I'd give the sound, music and the voice acting of this game a solid 8/10.

The Combat

The big combat mechanic war between the player base as some hate it and other's fairly enjoy it. Out of all the games I've played and actually remember, for all those reading to see if you'll like it I suggest watching a video of it or simply read the following as I TRY to elaborate this system. Carrying on, the system pretty much follows a 1 - 7 keyboard setting with a combo like system similar to that of Cabal Online and Blade and Soul. The Cabal Online aspect of it is the following, when opening up your combo, you press a skill from 1 - 3, these are the skills for the specific stance you currently have equiped. Much like in GW2's combat mechanics, these stances could also be in reference to how in GW2 each main hand weapon outputs a diferent skill set from 1-3. So if you got that down, good. Now, when you activate a said skill from 1 - 3 on your keyboard you have a combo mechanic kick in. Much like to how you would start your combo skill in Cabal Online, you have a meter indicating a gauge indicating how much time you have left before the combo breaks - though in Cabal Online it was pretty much press it on the right area and not time based. Beside the gauge there's a set of 3 different skills that are bound to R, T and Y respectively. Much like how it is in Blade and Soul, pressing 1 of the 3 letters will chain link your combo enabling you to do damage amd/or cc to your opponent. And that's pretty much skills from 1-3, skills 4-7 are your abilities in which you can configure into any combination you would like. Personally, although there is no dodge rolls for potential evasion and although there are some animation locks, I enjoy the combat and I believe that NeoWiz did an excellent job in displaying a ""better"" combat system. Overally I'd give the combat in this game a 8/10 due to the fact of my own personal dislikes, though I know of some other's who would definitely give it a 9 or even a 10 in their books.

The Graphics

""LAG! WHY IS THE GAME SO LAGGY?!"" is practically all you'll hear in the help chat in practically any of the servers (I have a character in all but the 1st server) and it's quite funny and quite sad at the same time. I find this astonishingly hilarious because I feel as though the general outlook of most gamers are to test and never understand. I admit, I was lagging too that I had to turn the graphics down during my streams and first reaction of the game. Although I had initially thought it was server, I came to realize everyone else having the same issue and wanted to know why. Little did we all know, thanks to someone on reddit for pointing it out and also on youtube for making a video on how to fix it, that the game's .ini setting has the game's min setting of fps to 13 and the max to something like 22 - which is VERY BAD. After changing and saving these settings I've come to appreciate the game in all max graphics with no lag whatsoever. However, people still have a tendency to complain and why not right, I mean it's what we all do until we get something free out of it. This act of complaining eventually got me to ask myself, can your computer even run the game? So before even buying the game, I implore you to look up the graphical requirements of the game before even getting it then wasting people's time trying to find out why you bought a ""shitty"" game that you want to spread negative views about. With that out of the way, the graphics in this game are really beautiful. Running it in both preset 1 and preset 5, I could say the difference was there but if you played from afar you wouldn't even notice that much of a drastic change. Both spectrums work well and can be played quite reasonably. It's quite well with the engine it's running on and does well in par to 2018 graphics. Overall, I'd rate the graphics of this game with a 9/10 because although it's aesthetically pleasing to see, there are minor kinks in some sections where you will freeze upon doing a particular action (opening up windows, entering cutscenes, etc).

Overall Score: 8/10

Despite the hiccups in servers and the misconcepted texts, I feel as though Bless Online could get really far with minor works. The game in itself is quite enjoyable, especially moreso with friends/family willing to play with you, and is very reminiscint of the old school type of tab targetting system. Although not perfect at all by it's current nature, it has a long ways to go if it ever is to become the success NeoWiz wants it to be. Would I give this/buy this for a friend? Most definitely, if they're the type to run rampage in a faction type game, most definitely. However, if you're the type to just casually hop on a MMORPG for the PvE aspects, I'd say give it a wait until they slowly find a way to pertain to your needs. It's a PvPvE game starting at lvl 30 and getting exp from your enemies faction's death while maintaining a good skill cap makes it veer off most/some people.",True,1527635771,1527635771,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Bless online's Head Start launch is just like every MMORPG's launch; It has started off rough and doesnt run perfectly, and it probably wont for at least a month (The Devs no matter how prepared they will be will never truly be ready for the games launch, thats just how it is). With this being said, I have still been able to experience a decent start to the game, and I never had the mindset going in that this game would be ""The Game to Change The MMO Genre"" or ""So Amazing My Pants Just Somehow Traveled Off My Body and All The Way To Romania To Have Brunch"". Hype on a game can seriously kill the expectations of it, and honestly I have no idea what expectations people truly had for Bless for its community to throw a tantrum (and I've been in the Bless Discord Chat for a while just to pop my little face in and kind of get a look at it to see if there were others like myself and look away just so I could have a blind perspective on the game). I could go on about the professionalism of the Community Managers and the Community, but thats lame; so I'll switch up the mood with how the games gone so far.

Creating my character how I wanted to, actually went well; I was able to adjust my creation to almost exactly how I wanted. the only thing I didnt like was the tattoo selection for my body was limited, but there were so many for my face (and I'm not a face tattoo kind of guy).

The Gameplay feels fun and the story, at least from the start, is simple enough for me to follow along (not to mention theres voice acting that isnt actually that bad to help my lazy self pay attention). Cutscenes didn't exactly work out sometimes, as some would kind of just freeze and pull me from immersion, but the races felt simple and their backstories arn't too bad (personally I felt I vibed with the Aqua Elves more), but going in, there wasn't exactly a class I felt I wanted to really play. I usually like playing DPS in most MMOs, but I just felt not much of an interest toward any class (not to mention im garbage at games so shooting fire at things or just blindly swinging a sword is usually my go to), but I mostly experienced the game through a Guardian and I actually liked it! It felt good to kinda start off as a tanky class; the combat didnt feel slow at all (so far), and the animations and starting gear actually looked cool (compare that to most other MMOs with their dirty potato sack that I have to run around in until im level 40 or I buy a costume to hide my ugly exterior from the other potato sack adventurers). The problems I had with the class was mostly the tutorial part; I didn't really know what I was doing to set my skills and how to execute somethings, but after I realized the mounting thing and what they call hotbars, it all kinda just fell into place. After that, I was a little bummed out how long I spent in my starting locations (but shorter time there is a good and bad thing depending on how you immerse yourself in games and if you're playing with others). I also really look forward to Dungeons and PvP (and im never one for pvp, I like my pve adventures) it could have the potential to keep me playing and finding a guild to be a part of for all the fun!

The Taming in the game was what I really wanted to just go out and start doing, but I didnt really start trying to catch 'em all till I was about level 10ish, where they kinda show you how its done. The Taming section is simple, Space to win, and the tab that holds what you've tamed is sectioned out as Mounts, Flying, and Pets (no Magikarps for me to ride I guess); and just so you know I have a whopping 2 Pets Tamed (only because I didnt really want to tame anything until I found like a stray cat, which I havent)! Tamed beasts don't fight with you, they just buff you which is still cool and useful!

The World itself looks pretty big to go out and see, but I did struggle a bit due to my need to do those side missions and hunt missions (Hunt Missions are just kill the same enemy a billion times to get some goodies, but its still fun to switch up  my sweet moves and shatter the hopes of the millions of horses and jackels that they won't grow old with a family).

The game itself has some odd quirks, such as the UI can't be changed much (it feels kind of big and bulky), text not fitting right in some boxes, some of the voice acting didn't match what was in the subtitles, and I couldn't find a cat to abduct like I'm Batman getting a new sidekick. (I'm refraining from mentioning how laggy the game was and how I almost died twice due to the game seemingly freezing before a scripted combat sequence, and the optimization issues because all of this can be easily fixed within their launch period of the game).

They've left some room for future updates with potential for upcoming races and classes, I have a couple things I'd like to see in future updates ((Now mind the fact that perhaps they are in the game but I just haven't gotten far enough to know or already in the works (its still pretty early on and I have no interest in rushing to max level or building a time machine to find out right now))
*Events. Events Tend to bring me back and keep me around, It's also fun to sometimes change the mood of serious games with less serious events.

*Events for guilds. Guild leaders can set up raids, field bosses, and group activities themselves, but sometimes it's nice to actually have things for guilds to do, rather than guilds just exist to exist.
*Player Housing. I like to have a home to hang my achievements and stare off into the sunset out of my windows.
*Community Created Outfits. I like seeing the cool ideas people have for dressing up in games
*Expansions. I don't what it is, but story and location expansions are just fun to see and experience.
*Power Adjusting for classes. please dont nerf classes to hell because they seem OP, why not just make the others OP to match..
*Fishing. I'm not one for fishing, but people like it in games, gives you something to do when you just want some downtime from questing and beating on eachother.

There's probably lots more to add (and I'm sure others have much better ideas than I do), but the Dev's have their hands full with the launch to worry about stuff down the line right now.

To kind of sum up my rambling: Launch is never a good time to start any game, the community needs to grow up a bit, good customization, fun gameplay, easy taming mechanics, a neat world to delve into, and Bless has room for current and future improvement! 
(And this is all from like a few hours of playing, god knows how much more exciting stuff there is later down the line!)

First and foremost, I will not be requesting a refund for the game as I will continue to follow it in hopes somethings improve.

That said, the overall recommendation for Bless is currently negative. It is NOT due to server instability and crashes. For decades of MMORPG launches this has always been a plague of the industry. However, you would think in 2018 this wouldn't really be an issue. But unfortunately it is. But that's not the cause of the negative recommendation. And while though it states on the Steam page that this is an early access title, unfortunately that's just not true. This game has been out for years in other regions of the world - Korea, Russia, and Japan. The BASE game has been out for quite a while now.

The negatives stem from much more. The Bless Rebuild Project was announced back in 2017 when Aeria Games backed out of publishing (thank god!!!). So in this time Neowiz mainly needed to revamp the combat system, translate, possibly make it a bit more shiny, bug smash, optimize. 

What..? Let's break it down:

+ For the most part I do enjoy the combat structure. I get what they're trying to do. Through further tweaking and analyzing I think it'll be fine.

- Though I do not PERSONALLY care, the action combat system was completely removed for every class except Berserker. Just does not make sense to only allow one class to utilize this system especially since it was apparentally a promised feature. Customers are having feelings of false advertisement

+ The cash shop, while yeah it's a bit overpriced for small things like inventory slots, etc., it does NOT feature any P2W elements. Good on you Neowiz

- Founders Packs are CHARACTER bound, not account bound. Once you accept it on your first character, that's it.

- No server transferring especially with all the ruccus  around the servers going on

- The Bless splash screen. Now this one I can't even fathom why it has not even been acknowledged by the Devs. This is a MAJOR issue. Thousands of customers spent $40 to $150 and cannot even access the log in screen. Now to the other side of this, yes they could be focusing more on server stability first, as once they fix this issue that's going to allow a lot more people into the game, thus continuing the server issues.

- The optimization is just ungodly horrendous. I run a high end gaming rig which pushes most games in native 4k to 40-60fps. I turned this game to 720p on the lowest graphical settings ( 1 ) and couldn't sit on a stable frame rate.

- The translations are abysmal. I'm assuming they took to Google Translate for the majority of the game. Players could barely get out of the tutorial area due to the horrible translations. Funny enough though as of what cutscenes I've watched.... They're fine.

So far the negatives by far outweigh the positives. For those stating they're running highest settings at a constant 60fps? I'm sorry I just don't buy it. I do not believe you under any meaning of the word.

Overall do not buy this in the state it is in. It's quite frightening to see this many problems in a game that has been out for years. It's not looking too good right now.",True,1527634597,1527634597,False,0,0,0.000000,True

This game is not polished enough for an official NA release. The controls are clunky, already a red flag for a action MMO.

The voice acting sounds like they grabbed some people from Fiver, handed them some lines and gave literally 0 context.

The translation for essential UI elements is abysmal. I spent probably 5 minutes trying to figure out what the tutorial wanted me to do for my berzerker. It was asking me to allocate the ""fury stance"" when I had only 2, and neither were called that. Also the allocating it wanted me to do was under a button that said ""mount"" so they should at least get that right.

I also spent probably a good 45 minutes trying to get into the game, getting stuck at the same intro title screen before server selection until I finally got lucky and got in, and I'm the minority of people that it worked for, have a friend who has been trying all day and every time he gets in the game crashes or disconnects and he has to try again.

And finally the servers are laughable. Currently reviewing during a 2 day head start. Once the official release hits, they are going to get absolutely flooded, and it'll be like every MMO, most of the servers from what I saw on NA were already full, how are they going to cope with the full release?

For one, the game is translated horribly. Everything is written in broken English, and some quest prompts do not function correctly, displaying a random character instead of the intended keys.

Two, the game's HUD and gameplay is clunky, and UI quality is quite low in terms of aesthetics and functionality. The game feels cheap from the moment you log in.

Chat filters are broken and filters random words in nearly every line communication (I imagine this will be fixed soon).

Finally, there has been little to no communication from the publishers / developers right up until launch, besides the bare minimum details. In times past, this would indicate that the community feedback loop present in many top games would be missing, added in with an additional barrier between developers and the community coming from another market.

Yes, yes it's an ""early access title and we all know what that means however, It is an ""early access"" that was previously released in Korea, Japan, and Russia where it failed subsequently .

Furthermore, in other regions, there are a total of 8 classes; however, the western version has only 5. This means you have a very limited range of character classes to chose from, with only 1 tank class and 1 ""healer"" class. Which makes the current combat not feel satisfying in my opinion. Not to mention, since the combat system is not that different from its other releases (this may change in the future) I don't understand the removal of the other classes .

Another complete minus is the voice acting, While at it's best it can be decent for the rest it horrific . Also, tooltip translations for skills are completely massacred thus it makes the confusing and dull combo system even less rewarding, as you truly will not understand what some skills do at all.

Some other issues for me also revolve around a poor UI customization (it's lacking completely)
→ no player to player trading (which might be set to stop booting)
→ no bloody auto-loot function giving the clunky targeting system and lag 
→ horrendous default key bindings (thank Hades you can change them)
→ camera position issues 
→ ho ho ho those aggressive chat filters !
→ title screen simulator; you need to waste 30 minutes plus restarting the game hoping you'll get to the server selection where you will → wait another hour or so to get past the sea of queued players .
→ You go to a shop to buy gear? Good luck ! It has no class sort option... 
→ Gear drops for the classes they removed from the game; really ? If there's no assassin character that I can create why am I getting assassin gear?
→ I might just be a noob but I never actually got to locate that damn sprint stamina bar ! Is it implemented ?
→ the complete lack of support for the players reminded me of their ""premium customer service"" for their founders pack which they removed upon backlash from the community . Little did we know they removed it for good !
→ pay extra to get an ""early"" start get stuck in a queue, you finally manage to log in and you see a big announcement with server maintenance in 5 minutes
→ poor story quests


Going to the good parts of the game 

→ I did enjoy running around in the bless universe but I'm not sure that's because the game is great/good or even decent . It might be because I simply wanted a new mmo to play and picked this one out of the sea of MMO's out there.

→ easy to learn combo system 
→ one of the worst game launches I've seen; they even managed to fuck up the 2 day early access (just lol)

Just a very average Korean MMO with horrible optimization, only five classes, plenty of bugs, and plenty of ways to spend money. However, this version does a feature a ""revamped"" combat system that is more action-oriented (unless you play guardian, ranger, mage, or paladin; they're stuck with tab-targeting) and, in my opinion, feels worse than the ""Rebuild Project"" that I played on Korean servers.

HOWEVER i would not recommend it at this stage as the server management and predictions were poor about the players count and interest.
I have experienced very poor play during 28-29.05.2018 on EU servers as they had to shut down urgently for 1 hour while the launch started just 3 hours ago.
Realms increased from 2 to 4, however this did not resolve the performanse issues on the next day. Game was unplayable on EU, while on US servers despite the 100 more latency I had, the game was ok most of the time.
They had to bring the servers down on 29 too to resolve the performance issue that everyone was experiencing, but again with 1 hour urgent maintenance.
Next one is that game does not connect/load every time and runs exclusively with DX9. Why?

I've played many others, witnessing (and enduring) several ropey launches along the way.
The Early Access launch of Bless takes the launch experience to a whole new low level.
In it's currect state the game and/or the servers are pretty much broken.
Thousands of players (myself included) basically cannot get past the Bless splash screen as the game loads up.
For many that's actually been their entire experience of Bless so far.
I have at least got into the game a couple of times during the 11 hours Steam has me reported as playing.
A rough breakdown would be about 90 minutes in character creation (that part is a good experience, lots and lots of customisation options mostly on sliders for easy use) and around three hours of gaming.
More than half of the 11 hours has been spent trying to load the game and getting stuck at the splash screen.
Of the time actually in game, two hours was spent repeatedly trying to complete one part of a kill-quest. Three mobs out of a spawn of six needed to die, but no matter how many I actually killed (hundreds in the end), the quest remained at 0/3 kills.
I was not alone, all across the server nobody was getting anything done. The game server was clearly overwhelmed.
The game is also thoroughly unforgiving to your graphics card. My poor GTX 1060 6GB card was working flat out.
This isn't a surprise given the level of detail in the game world and characters. I wasn't getting massive frame-rate drops, but many many other people were struggling with that issue.
In its' current state I cannot recommend Bless.
If you were thinking of buying the game, hold off for now, you really don't want to be a part of this fiasco.

-History of the Bless-

1, Devs (Neowiz Bless Studio) talked about the game concept, etc..
2, KR Server started with 16 Server.
3, but KR Players noticed there is a lot issue for game quality.

4, many KR Players started to quit the Bless. then amount of servers were decreased by half (8 Server).
5, Devs trying to improve the game quality for prevent more player losses.
6, but can't stop the players quitting because they can't improve the quality so much.
amount of servers were decreased by 2 server.

7, Russia Server started with publisher ""101XP"".
8, KR Server's amount were decreased again to single server.
9, Russia Server discontinued with half-year due to ""lack of game quality"".

10, Aeria Games canceled the publishing to EU/NA due to ""lack of quality and performance"".
11, Devs started ""Rebuild Project"" for returning back the honor. (:thinking:)
12, JP Server was started with ""Rebuild Version"".

13, However there is no improvement so much than KR (100vs100 Lagfest even skill activation, poor framerate, etc), JP Players started to quitting with bad review on several review websites.
14, Fatal exploit (Enchant Item DUPE) were found on JP Servers, and devs kept the nerf about crafting, enchanting, etc.
15, more JP Players quitting Bless because they can't hold the trust to the devs/publisher anymore.

I don't want to make a long review, probably I will edit this as Early Access goes on, but at the current state of founder packs Early Access here's what I have to say:

-Queue simulator 2018
-No pre-download, game is ~20GB, meaning people with slow connections will spend their 2 days headstart downloading the game.
-They started with only 1 server per region making it unable for everyone to login, forcing them to keep shutting down the servers for maintenance. Also the game in EU was released in afternoon-night give or take (time zones average), by the time they managed to fix everything so we could properly login, it was after midnight for Europe, most people went to sleep and lost their first day of headstart.
-1€=1$ pricing. This could also be considered as a scam. They also did this to other currencies as I've seen. Game costs 39$ but if you re in Europe you get to pay 39€. Here's some normal conversion rates: https://i.imgur.com/uUfbZnx.png

On the other hand I would like to point out it's still a very good MMO with a bad start. 
Graphics and sound effects are great, the reworked combat system is good although it's not working completely and also the translation is incomplete.
For some people it felt like a paid alpha test, with people paying to play 2 days before just to stress out the servers before normal release.

Negative points: 

-you have to configure some .ini files to get the game to actually f***** work. 
-game's optimization makes kittens die and children weep, it's so bad it makes you wonder what the f*** did the devs do in almost a decade of working on this sorry excuse of a game (yes it's almost that old).
-camera is beyond  f***. Action camera? yes but only on ranger and zerker. It's not a bug guys it's a feature 
-I wish the translation was done by google translate, alas that's not the case since it would've actually made some sense that way. 
-no trading, again who likes to trade with their friends in a mmorpg. They got rid of that, smart. 
-if you want to play the game, it's RNG. Yes, you read right, RNG. You may or you may not enter the game when clicking on play. Fail, try again, fail, try again. 
-It's not EA, it's pre alpha. They made a mistake when they released it. 
-braindead NPCs
-lame a** combat
-did I mention lame a** combat? 
-yes I did 
-you can't actually get in the right server, If you have friends on a different server, GG you're f***d, 
-servers die like flies, maintenance after maintenance without actually improving anything
-some servers are locked, they  impose faction choices or just let you play with character creation without actually letting you in the game. Fun fun fun 
-lumena or cash shop currency CHARACTER BOUND.
-game capped at 62 fps. You need to edit some .ini to uncap it. How very 2k18

that wrapps up the negative points. 

Positive points:  

+ can be easily refunded even after the 2 hour limit.

- B2P, P2P and P2W in one go. Some people say XP potions, crafting materials (non runes!) and anti-pvp flags aren't p2w. I dare to disagree.
- Very unoptimized. Runs at 25 fps with a 970 GTX on minimum settings with ini tweaks.
- DX9 UE3 in 2018
- support is nonexistent
- Groups of players split apart due to last-minute server adding
- witholding of information literally hours before release (no action mode for most classes).
- A joke of a translation, up to the point where tooltips are nonsense and the tutorial gives you a false flag to complete
- some quests prevent progression.
- the game got censored in the west, removing nudity and adult themes in order to get a T rating.

Nós que somos fãs de MMO's estavamos ansiosos por um jogo que pudesse nos trazer a vontade de jogar um bom MMORPG com amigos e grindar por lvl, fazer raids, pvp, gvg e por aí vai.
Comprei a versão antecipada o tal pacote de fundador que custou R$90,00, valor muitooooo alto para um jogo na steam atualmente.
Mas estaria tudo bem se pelo menos desse pra aproveitar os dois dias antecipados.
Infelizmente das 10 horas de jogo, fiquei travado na tela inicial por umas 7 horas pelo menos. Quando consigo entrar no jogo enfrento quedas bruscas de fps, travamentos em todo lugar e quedas do servidor.
Aparentemente não se prepararam muito bem para o lançamento. É inadmissível um jogo tão caro ter um bug tão bizarro já no laucher.

SOBRE OS SERVIDORES:

No primeiro dia haviam apenas 3 servidores e logo lotaram. Foi necessária a criação de outros 3 servidores.
Diversas pessoas comentaram negativamente aqui na Steam por este motivo. Haviam filas enormes para entrar nos servidores (como todo lançamento). 

Hoje (segundo dia) os servidores ficaram bem estáveis e sem filas para conectar !

Considerando que é um EA eu estou bastante satisfeito com a maneira que está caminhando.

SOBRE O JOGO:

Demorei anos para encontrar um MMO no estilo clássico, sem muita ""firula"" e sem Pay To Win.
Para quem não está empolgado com os MMOs do mercado, porquestão de PayToWin ou de Combate Lento, Bless certamente é a melhor opção para 2018.



PROS: 

- Visual do jogo totalmente Clean. Sem excesso de detalhes. Estilo Clássico.
- Possui a Trindade como todo MMO que se preze. 
- PvP com sentido. (você pode até adquirir seus itens por meio de PvP Points)
-Combate reformulado e mais complexo. 
-*****ZERO PAY TO WIN***** (algo extremamente difícil nos dias atuais)
-Pode ser jogado tranquilamente por jogadores casuais pois é rápido chegar ao lvl máximo apenas fazendo quests.
-Ao contrário de dezenas de MMOs, você não precisa matar milhões de Mobs para subir de nível.
- Não é um jogo para ser jogado apenas Solo. Há dungeons e raids que somente são possíveis em grupo.

CONS:

- A otimização não está boa ainda. Diversas pessoas estão com 25-30 FPS. Isso não impede de jogar plenamente, mas tem que ser melhorado.
- Algumas pessoas estão tendo problema para fazer login e necessitam reinicar o jogo para conseguir.



Recomendo muito o jogo.

With Bless, that is currently active in JP, RUS, and KR, one would think be some what stable, but feels like a Beta release.

While i understand that you can not predict everything & launch being critical at ironing out the presenting issues of massive connections, you can tell that the framework theyre using can not sustain the large player base. This is an issue of UE3 at its core & the framework they present to work along with the build of the game. There is a reason proper made games focus on their netcode firstly, take notice if they will have to reconstruct the game engine or build one from scratch. All of these issues are as bright a day to see for everyone as a developer & someone who tinkers with UE. 

Aside from what ive said earlier, the game is still meh. I've played JP,KR,RU Bless. All of which still present to me that they have not even taken seriously to build their game enviornment. Basic shaders,Basic materials & assets. Almost feels like they've made this game with the ""Blueprint"" design feature UE offers and not a object-oriented,omponent-oriented language. The game enviornment feels empty and just basic, as if someone just placed assets all over the world with no care and thats it. 

Skill usage still feels very basic.... Although I would say much better than before the Rebuild of the game. UI Clunky & cheap feelings, almost as if the UI is still a prototype. 

Such an awesome take on the mount system, yet they mess it up with having a stamina system. Stamina goes down very quick, jumping kills it so fast its ridiculous. I dont know what the devs were thinking when they introduced this, especially with the world being so big. 

Quality of skins,effects & costumes isn't so bad, i enjoyed it.

Not much content to do really. Dungeons or Monster quest killing is just about all youre really going to be doing. Besides PvP being end game, which by the way, i dont see be enjoyable with such performance and network issues. 

Over all, This game is still so incomplete... I would consider the state of this game Alpha to Pre-Alpha... 
Bless, After all the issues you have had, you should be letting us play this game for free, You should provide us with proof that your game is in a better state rather than charging us for packs. Pure Sillyness.

Alright so i'm not gonna review the game on the quality of graphics and gameplay blah blah blah but really on how I feel about this game. Iv'e been playing mmos for a long while now and I prefer them more than other genres. Heard bless was coming out and I was pretty stoked because i was tired of the mmos that we have as to date. I'm your average joe when it comes to games i'm not sponsered by some company or stream any videos so I can get donations and stuff. I missed work so I could get into the early access because well damned I was straight stoked to try the game as of anyone else who is playing. Before launch the Founders Collection sold for 149.99 when it hit launch time ***BAM*** bumped up to 199.99. o.O WTF!!!!!. They totally just raised the price maybe it was USD than CAD i dunno but w.e I bought it anyway. Downloaded it bam got it after a 400 queue wasn't that bad. Game starts out as every other mmo out there but there was a ton of people actually on asking questions, b***tching you know the usual. Didn't mind it though because people were actually playing and talking in the community. Got about a hour of game time than bam disconnect server issues no problem ill just relog. Well that didn't happen and I had to wait for a queue of over 1400 people T_T. F**K ill wait i was enjoying myself. Got to the character select after about a hour  **BAM** disconnect and try to relog servers down too be expected thats fine. Check out the community board well maintenance for about 1hr30mins okay ill do something else and  comeback. Checked about 20 mins before the reopen of the server and its up and now its a queue of 2400 people X_X. Everyone will probably take this as B***tching and complaining well your probably one of the people that didn't spend 200$ to just be scammed because it sucks. The games good has its problems but im still wanting to come home skip the gym and play because it's actually fun.

The translation may be slightly off in some areas but that is what ""/h"" is for (help chat). I found it funny that it took me an hour to get past tutorial trial because I wasn't mentally connecting a specific word with its synonym counterpart.

Considering all the alpha, closed beta, open beta, release games I have tested since 1997, I have to say that this game is doing well on its initial release.

During Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn,  its initial ""reborn"" release had a huge plague of instabilities with their own servers. What ended up occurring was that an entire week of no one being able to play was issued by putting the game into maintenance mode to fix said instabilities. At least now we can still play. At the moment, Bless Online isn't having that sort of major server instability problems, for which I applaud the fact that stability is being focused on straight from the get-go rather than just going with the flow of things like what Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn once did when it first came into release after it had a previous blunder of its past builds before a complete rework was ordered. As one can see now, a rework of a game's fundamentals can help a game tremendously and it is to my understanding that NEOWIZ was trying to do this when it failed in other regions which is why I have given them the benefit of the doubt, and I believe many others have too.

I've discovered people crying over spilled milk after they purchased founders and it stating there will not be a refund, with certain rare exceptions (according to previous posts here on steam). So if your one of those people, you should have read the fine print and understood that it would be backed up with little exception.

I tested a different release of Bless Online a few years ago within a different region and from what I have found in the present build here on Steam, the controls feel much better now than what I remembered them to be and movement feels improved too.

Some people have mentioned lag on a good system within towns and kept getting upset about the lag in town. Well, I have a good system also and found that by lowering the client's graphic-animations from ""5"" to ""4"" actually solves this problem (I am a 1080ti user). Speaking of graphics, the game is very nicely detailed if one actually slows down and just views what is created before them instead of rushing the game.

I also understand that autoroute often stops midway to its destination but I would like to think this to be a deterrent for botting or anything remotely similar. Basically, you still need to be at the keys is what I am hoping the reasoning for this to actually be.

I would like to say once more, yes translations in this game are not up to par with what they should be but it's possible that it could be because of the amount of time taken to try to rework the fundamentals of the game from previous versions so that a much more successful build would be able to be produced in English and released on Steam. Translations are still readable by a huge margin but luckily there is the help channel ""/h"" to ask questions until proper translations are made. I believe they had to be roughly translated due to the amount of work that needed to be done on the backend of the game. Had server stability not snuck up and become such a problem recently due to the masses flooding the ""gates"" when trying to enter the world, I would like to think that translations would indeed have been fixed quite quickly within the past few days the game has been released on steam.

In the end, I will give them a month to fix the underlying problems that seem to be costing them in the rating game. I will still give them the benefit of the doubt because from what I remember in other regions, the game has been improved and seems to have uncovered something positive that could bring the game out of its failing state -- it just depends on how quickly the instability problem is fixed.

Customers or potential customers should take all review comments with a grain of salt because ultimately the individual should try it before relying on comments since people have different tastes -- let alone experiences within the game. Many people are angry because they cannot play the game the way they want due to problems that are occurring on the English reworked version of Bless Online. So, do not let others decide for you, try it out and understand that one should treat game reviews just like movie critic reviews. However, the instability of the servers is something everyone should be aware of.

I still like the game but there is a lot of room for improvement and I hope it is done quickly with quality in mind.",True,1527632236,1527721932,True,0,1,0.000000,True

I played the game after buying the $150 Founders Edition, the game itself (excluding all performance based issues) is fun to play. I constantly find myself trying to grind out and complete the hunting quests, I just can't bring myself to stop. I very much like the tab targeting twist, it's not really action combat but not completely tab targeting. It is a unique combat system, the closest in game combat to Bless would probably be Blade and Soul.

Now I am not ignoring the plethora of problems that this game launched with but, it is ""Early Access"". If you participated in the 2 day head start you should of known what you were getting yourself into. There are games that launch without issue but it is to be expected to run into some issues. I myself knew the servers would be a huge issue as they more than likely failed to understand the amount of people that would be trying to load into the game. Performance issues are atrocious really, I myself had to spend about 30 minutes going through the .ini files to make the a bit more stable and run at 60+ fps, should we have to do this? [b]No...[/b] However to me this is forgivable as long as it is fixed within a week or so.

Character custimization is not as in depth as BDO but more in depth than Archeage. I enjoy the options I was granted with while creating a character I have no quarrels with anything in regards to character custimization.

So in all, I would say judge the game for yourself, if it isn't for you it isn't for you. However I myself will be playing and will continue to watch Bless grow. The only issues I see from others right now are 1. Them not understanding the many varying issues that go into launching a game and 2. Are whiny brats that reinforce their hype again and again. A game will not be a game worth playing if you do not allow to take lift and fly.

Thats when i stopped playing and decided to wait till this morning the 29th and  getting in was better but as i got in the fps was so bad i had to wait 5 ish min for things to render on my screen keep in mind im on a 50mb connection and i have a gtx 1060 6gb so not a potato by far then once it rendered i was averaging about 20-24 fps i did the first quest of dropping the dead body and went afk for 5 min and came back to a disconnected screen server crash again i didnt claim my rewards as a founder after i had found out if you for example claim them on a character on server 1 and dont want to be that character you lose all founder items on your new character and if god forbid you delete that character you lost all founder stuff forever,True,1527632141,1527632141,False,0,1,0.000000,True

The combat is refreshingly fast paced and easy to pick up, the graphics are pretty nice (though I've been playing WoW for years, so take it witha  grain of salt), and theres a MASSIVE amount of character customization. Seriously, people spent over an hour in the character creator alone. I'm also really fond of the Pokemon-style catch 'em all mount/pet system. I find a random animal out in the forest that looks vaguely rabid? Hell yeah I'll tame it and ride that sucker to the next town! Find some cute fox or a ravenous hellhound? Well, they're mine now, so I hope they like traveling with a two foot tall cat man. You can also level your mounts and pets so they can get new skills and bonuses, which I find very interesting.

Of course, there are problems with it; lag issues, random DC, FPS problems. That's typical for a ""new"" game release (yes I know its already been out in other countries), but its before launch so bugs are common. That happens with any video game ever. WoW is over a decade old and theres still lag/fps/DC issues in every patch that comes out. You just have to be patient.

Yes, from what I've heard from other players, the game devs haven't treated them well in regards to refunds for the founders packs and whatnot. I bought the standard edition because I've learned my lesson in the past about spending too much money on a game that was still in pre-release.

All in all, this is a good game to invest time into. Yes, there are language issues and we can only hope they'll be fixed, but if you spend half a second actually reading the text, then you can figure out what it wants you to do. Yes, there are lag/fps issues, but there is an easy fix for that and if any bitches and whines about it affecting their gameplay, then they're just lazy. It has good graphics, wonderful customization, refreshing combat system, and an expansive mount/pet system. I honestly think its worth the $40 bucks. Yeah, it would be nice at $30, but I've had more fun in this game for the last couple days than I have in anyh other MMO for the last year.

Changing the ini files made me get a ton more fps now I average 50-80 fps in areas with some people and npcs. Places with a ton of people in one place is still really bad fps but this is almost every game. For example, in Guild Wars 2 in Lion's Arch, one of the main hubs, my fps dips to 40-45 compared to the rest of the game. In Ffxiv in Rhalgar's Reach my fps also dips to around 45. Keep in mind these areas are not as congested as the first area of a game that just launched where literally everyone is trying to do the same thing.

In Bless after some people got further into the game so the capital city wasn't so congested but still had people, my fps was 50+. In the open world my fps gets to 60+ sometimes killing mobs while people are still around. Keep in mind I did change my ini files for this type of fps, since before this I got 34-45 max. For reference I have an i5-4690k (not overclocked) and a gtx 970, running at 1080p. I would say this game is definitely not for everyone but if you don't mind changing ini files, have money to spare, and you're interested in trying a new mmo this might be worth it to see if you'll like it.

Many of the negative reviews are because of server issues, queue times, and not being able to play with friends. This is expected for almost every mmo launch. When even big companies can't smoothly launch an mmo what did you expect here? When Ffxiv Stormblood launched, I waited in long queue times, I spam clicked a quest that was bugged for more than a day to try and get it done, the new areas that were introduced had worse fps because of the congestion. 

Positives:
+Fun combat imo
+ Parts of the world look really nice, other parts are just ok (Forest elf starting area was my favorite so far)
+No P2W currently. Cash shop is Exp boosts, costumes, inventory expanson, appearance change item.
+Music is nice
+Cutscene animations are decent compared to Ffxiv ones I'm used to, voice acting isn't the worst ever and is acceptable.
+You can exchange PvP tokens for a max of 60 of the premium currency a day, called Lumena similar to GW2's gold to gem conversion except this game has a cap.
+Pvp is encouraged and rewarded but there is also PvE content. There are no raids atm but the Japanese version has them. For endgame PvE, there are currently 3 end game dungeons you can do. 
+Pet and mount system is nice. You tame things around the world with taming scrolls to be your pet or mount. Taming is a simple pressing space at the right time mechanic but its nice to be able to essentially catch them all.

Negatives:
+Optimization needs work so you don't need to tweak ini
+Bad translations currently makes some aspects of the game hard to undersatnd but they released a letter saying they are gonna be working on them.
+Premium currency is character bound but they say this is a bug so it should get fixed.
+Not all classes are currently released that are released in other versions. This version is missing Assassin, Mystic, and Warlock but they are gonna be releasing these in the future.

Here are the problems as I see them.

1) They said 1 mega server for EU with channels and that they could add channels as needed. What we got was servers that filled beyond capacity. Then they locked servers. Then friends no longer could play with you and guilds were split because of this. Had they simply let us know before hand we could have spread out more evenly. As is, you may get separated from your friends as they open and lock factions and servers.

2) The premium serviers is per character, not for your entire account. Seriously??? Also the in game currency, Lumena is per character as well. Costumes? The same! Totally screws your player base Neowiz.

3) There is no AFK timer. My friend played today for four hours, but then he walked away with his character still logged in. Eight hours later when he came back to play, his character was still logged in. Are you in a 3 hour queue? Well guess what? There are lots of players logged in that are not even playing the game. Yeah, that will piss you off.

4) The lag from hell. Click on something and then wait 3 mintues until the server catches up. Buying something off the auction house? Prepare to pay in game gold but get nothing due to server lag. The game is literally unplayable during peak hours.

5) Constant server crashes, crashes to desktop, oh and let's not forget half a dozen hour long maintainaces. 

6) This game has been released 3 times before and they failed each time. The 4th time appears no different. All the BS about this being early release is just that: BS. 

7) Unrepsonsive developer. Very little information put out from the. No transparancy, only promises to fix things.

You know, I ended up finally letting common sense kick in for a little. I really wanted to like this game, and I really wanted to be a part of it and the community, but then I just added up all the development mistakes that have happened in the past few months during the port, with the fact that it's a game that's failed in other regions not only due to its awkward combat, but the base game itself. Yes, it's listed as an alpha game, but every other port of this type (BDO, Archeage, etc) started out as an almost fully working game, with some bugs, or misstranslations here and there. Bless started out with tooltips that make almost no sense, and bugs so severe that areas reload as you're in them, over and over and over again. I tried to push myself to play on a Berzerker (the only class with a working action camera), and I was just flooded with bugs and grindyness that it wasn't worth pushing though it. 

I [i] wanted [/i] to love Bless. But in reality, if a game is coming to a new region, with their primary feature being a revamped and fun combat (that's not even fully implemented in the 5 classes they claimed to have adapted it to) it's just a bunch of fluff to a broken game. Maybe they'll work on it down the road, fix their laggy UI, actually implement the action camera, add a dodge mechanic to most classes that interupts animations (you'll find yourself animation locked in telegraphs a LOT), hire someone to translate their UI instead of using an auto translator (You've obtained 2level! 10% damage increase taken reduction!). If you REALLY want to try it, go ahead. Maybe you can push past all the bugs and stay on it long enough for the developers to ""fix"" it. But they'll probably just look for a new region to port it to, I hear Oceania is the new hotspot for thrice failed launches.

[h1] ----------------- Original Review ----------------- [/h1]

The game is actually pretty fun. Surprisingly fun considering how skeptical I was from the previous releases and how shady the development was. [b] (There’s a TLDR in the end) [/b]

That being said, there are so many issues with it right now that I can’t really recommend it. So, I’m going to start out with the bad, and lead into the good. I haven’t played it for long (only had the chance to make two characters and get them past the tutorial) but there is a lot that can be said in terms of issues from there. Here’s what I’ve picked up so far:

[h1] Breakdown [/h1]

[b] Graphics 3/5 [/b] - The game looks okay. It’s not great, and it’s not horrible. It’s basically a more realistic GW2 artstyle. The skills do look very neat, and the effects are enjoyable. The transition animations are horrible. If you’re walking in a straight line and turn left or right, your character snaps in whatever the direction you’re moving without any transitioning animations. Same for most skills, sometimes it looks like your spine is breaking in half to switch to whatever animation you’re transitioning into. It’s a bit awkward to look at, for me at least.

[b]Audio 4/5 [/b] – The soundtrack is nice, but the skill and weapon effects are amazing. You actually feel like you’re smacking down with your battle axe thing when you charge it up. It has a nice feeling to it combat wise. The voice acting is pretty bad, and you can’t tell if the voice actors didn’t care, or if they used Microsoft Sam for some of the voices. But the combat sound effects were so enjoyable that I only bumped a point off for the weird dialogue audio.

[b] Gameplay 2/5 or 4/5 [/b] – I’m having to give combat two scores, because it’s not fully implemented. If you’re playing a Berserker and you’re using the action camera, along with the combos, it’s really enjoyable. It doesn’t have the same excitement as BDO does, but it’s pretty good in it’s own way. It’s some weird hybrid that gives you a sense of flow, and lets you play around with the combos to figure out how to adjust your abilities to each situation. So 4/5 if you’re playing on the Berserker. For every other class, it’s a 2/5, because you’re stuck with a clunky tab targeting system and awkward movement animations that don’t look right. They’ve -disabled- the action camera system for every other class, without even warning the players. They’re supposed to bring them back at some point, but that’s just stuff I’ve head from other players.

[b] Story ?/5 [/b] – I can’t really judge the story yet, since I’ve only tickled it’s fancy. It seems like it has a lot of potential, if it wasn’t ruined by the awkward voice acting. The developers did make use of the generic evil villain with a robe and facemask, but I enjoy that type, so hopefully they’ll sort out the translations and voice acting soon.

[b] Pay2Win (No?) [/b] – Doesn’t seem like it is, the cash shop gives you minor boosters, but nothing that makes you mega overpowered. It’s basically pay-to-level-a-little-faster. Costumes offer no bonuses, nor do they make you almost invisible to other players. (cough, cough, BDO Ghillie Suit, cough)


[h1] Summary: [/h1]

It has the potential to be a really good game, I’m a huge mmo fanboy and love to play new games in the genre. Graphics are okay, and the sound effects are nice, combat and gameplay is pretty fun (on the ONE class it’s actually implemented in). If all of the classes had the action camera implemented, and the developers were more transparent about missing MAIN FEATURES, I’d definitely recommend Bless Online. But, at least for now, I’d say hold on to your wallets until the developers give us a proper announcement about what’s missing, why it’s missing, and when they plan on giving it to us. I understand that they’re still working on the Mystic/Assassin, and that’s fine, but it also looks like they’re working on four other classes and forgot to tell us. 

[b] Note: [/b] You have to edit an .ini file to remove the profanity filter, and your characters don’t have nipples. They used to, but now they magically lost them during some weird censorship that happened. Not a deal breaker to me, but the game was made T rating friendly.

[h1] TLDR: [/h1] 

I really want to recommend this game, but until there’s some proper communication from the developers about [b] BASE FEATURES [/b] that were shown in trailers and promised to us (I’m looking at you, gameplay video of a ranger “aiming” to shoot her arrows) I can't do that. [b] Buy it at your own risk. [/b]

Ich kann die ganzen negativen Reviews nicht verstehen!
Es sind die ersten beide Tage eines Spiels (MMO), NATÜRLICH gibt es Probleme, ich hab bis jetzt bei keinem MMORPG Start erlebt, dass alles glatt läuft und man muss sagen, dass hier sogar sehr schnell gehandelt wird!
Auch wurde Feedback der 2 Tage aufgenommen und immerhalb kürzerster Zeit versucht umzusetzen, bestes Beispiel ist die gerade öffentlich gemachte Statuswerte Änderung.

Das Kampfsystem gefällt mir recht gut, es ist eine Mischung aus Action und Point to Click, aber richtig gut umgesetzt. 
Auch gibt es absolut kein Pay2Win, im Shop gibt es jediglich 20% EXP Boost etc. zu kaufen, nichts was einem beispielsweise im PvP einen Vorteilverschaft! Jeder der etwas anderes sagt (und ich bin kein White Knight) sucht sich nur Gründe, um das Spiel aus welchen Gründen auch immer, schlecht zu machen.

Zu dem Thema Premium Account kann ich nur sagen: Ihr bezahlt fürMMO's wie zum Beispiel Final Fantasy 14 oder World of Warcraft monatlich 12€ Abo, der Premium Service ist an sich nichts anderes!

Ja, das Spiel ist vielleicht schon 3 mal gefloppt und wahrscheinlich auch verdient, dazu kann ich nichts sagen, ich habe die anderen Versionen nie gespielt. Jedoch muss ich sagen, dass sie anscheinen daraus gelernt haben und haben es hier besser gemacht, denn ich kann wirklich nichts negatives festellen bis auf die ""normalen"" Startprobleme eines MMORPG.

Пришлось искать процесс или перезагружать стим, чтобы заново её запустить. Пробовал разные способы, лишь бы запустить эту игру, но проблема скорее всего просто в сервере, который не выдерживает наплыва.
Даже после того, как подождал огромную очередь, я не смог создать персонажа на сервере, где играл мой друг. Потому что они закрыли возможность создания персонажей, чтобы люди переходили на другие сервера, так как их всего лишь 4. Так что пришлось играть в одиночку.
Далее, когда я всё же подключился к серверу номер 3, я создал персонажа и сразу же понял, что есть проблемы с оптимизацией, так как мои Intel i7 6700k с GTX 1060 6gb не очень-то хорошо тянут игру. И только благодаря ручному изменению конфиг-файлов игры мне удалось добиться неплохого фпса, который иногда опускался до 40, несмотря на то, что я так и не побывал в населённом городе, где обычно дела с фпс намного хуже.
Но самое зашкварное из всего этого... это проблемы с серверами. Даже если они не на максимум забиты, они ужасно глючат. Мой друг говорил о 10-30 секундных задержках перед тем, как ему засчитает какой-то квест. Но я просто был ШОКИРОВАН, когда осознал, что на моём сервере у людей задержка была от 2 до 10 минут, что сделало игру абсолютно неиграбельной. За 2 часа я не смог даже пройти 3 квеста. Я знаю, что это ранний доступ, но релиз меньше, чем через сутки. И я не знаю каким образом они успеют решить эти проблемы до того, как люди уйдут из игры и она станет мёртвой.
Кроме этих проблем есть еще менее надоедливые, вроде цензуры. Даже в чате полно цензуры. Почему-то зацензурили слова ""heck"", ""ag"", ""neowiz"". Поэтому тебя цензурят даже если ты написал слово ""agree"", ""lag"" или ""check"". Для 2018 года такие проблемы - это позор просто.
Сам английский перевод в игре тоже так себе. Будто всё переводили в гугл транслейте.
Игра не настолько плохая, как сам её релиз. Она выглядит староватой для 2018 года, ничего особенного в ней нет, старый движок UE3 со слабой оптимизацией, так что здесь реально нужны нормальные локализаторы и нормальный релиз, чтобы она зашла людям. Но нет, релиз очень даже провальный. Так что, если уж и покупать эту игру, так только после того, как они исправят все вышеописанные проблемы.
Для 50% игроков раннего доступа вообще не существует, потому что у них нет этого самого доступа к игре вообще, благодаря неподготовленным серверам. Так что да, я очень не рекомендую покупать её. По крайней мере... сейчас.",True,1527630892,1527630892,False,4,69,0.675546,True

I will completely leave out anything related to ""early access"" like lag or long queue times of which that could be it's own article but I'll leave that to others.

Here are some problems that are just of the regular kind:
1)They didn't get a real translator.  Everything appears to be translated with google translate or worse.  Actually if they used google translate they might have done a better job.
2)Because of the poor translation, good luck figuring out what your skills do.  Of course you could just turn your brain off like many suggest and mash buttons and probably win but what kind of way is that to play a mmo?  Don't you want to know what the abilities do? 
3)Because you don't know what your abilities do due to the poor translation, trying to use their skill tree system is nearly incomprehensible.  Sure, I could go spend a couple hours sleuthing it online but is that what you feel you should have to do on a game release like this?  
4)Using a controller with this game causes it to crash frequently.  For some reason if you assign buttons on your controller and hit more than one button at a time, instant crash.  This was my experience, but the game has native controller support so this is just not what it should do.
5)The game only boots up maybe 1 in 3 times for me.  Good luck getting to the character screen.  At the moment the meme of Bless being a 40$ wallpaper of the start screen is pretty accurate.
6) I could go on with other things like the story being incredibly light and it basically being a clone of Black Desert Online or Terra which you could have picked up for free or nearly free... and how it's kind of a slap in the face that they want to charge so much for this...but whatever",True,1527630888,1527631071,False,0,0,0.000000,True

As someone that had been looking forward to the western release for a long time, this release was a huge disappointment.  1)The combat system we were promised wasn't implemented except for one class.  
2)The character creation options are more limited than in any other version.  
3) Where as every other region this game was released as a mature or equivalent game, for steam it was turned into a teen game which caused the game to suffer heavily from missing classes, missing and altered cut scenes, missing quests and even quest lines that led to plot holes, disjointedness, and confusion that were not in the original. 
Even the visual feel is altered.  As one person put in the official developer forums ""the look of the game is no longer organic and logical but, like the changed story line, is similarly disjointed and filled with what are often nonsensical changes. Long flowing skirts and sleeves on combat armor for one example. Ridiculously impractical, bulky underwear that sometimes shows through clothing and would interfere with mobility for another. Several mobs have clothing that seems very contrived as if the localization team have a pathological fear of showing skin, let alone nipples, which comes across as extremely sexist and demeaning."" (quoted with permission).
4) Creation in factions and in some cases entire servers can be locked out suddenly resulting in it being very difficult to play on the same server as your friends and server transfers are rejected.
5) the ridiculously overpriced cash shop cosmetics are character bound to one char on one server.
6) Promised customer service turns out to be a zendesk account that does not respond at all to most requests.
7) The servers have been surprisingly unstable for a localized launch of a game that has been available on multiple regions.

I came across a very hyped up guild, they really really want this game to be great. I have played a total of not very much game play vs Waiting in que for hours and hours. I'll be honest, I was really hoping for a good game to come to NA, I wanted this to be that game. I am disapointed. The first red flag I got was when I was alerted that there was no refunds on purchase. Wait what? Why? I bought the deluxe version. Second flag was, on launch only 1 NA server?  Only 2 days early access? Thats all good if you can actualy play the game for a bit beforehand, the fact remains that of those 48 hours of early access play, you are in a que for hours, get down the que and boom server restarts and you're back at the whole rinse and repete que line. No AFK timers...at all..anywhere, so people who may just be afk for hours "" Holding thier spot"" can just be in the game till...oh wait...a server restart. Just get some afk timers. The audio makes me embarressed to have even taken part in the voicework for this :( Half the audio is glitchy or entirly missing. The constant crashes and fail to even load the game makes this not playable. I have been gaming for years, so I have a certain patience with launches and new games etc. Bless really shows how a lack of Dev knowledge and communication can ruin a potentialy good game. The combat feels empty and slow. The Market/Auction house....opens an out of game website...Founder pack items and gifts are locked to a character and server and not the account, so even if a player wanted to switch servers to a less populated server they would lose all that stuff. Again we come back to a big failure on the devs part. I am uncertain that even if Neowiz manages to clean up thier act, fix FPS and crashes, even if they improve the combat like they claimed they would...it won't be enough to save this game. I think GW2 has more chance to suceed at this point. Well, one thing is certain, Bless Online has made me appriciate other mmo titles out there and I am thinking of trying GW2 again, maybe even go give WoW a chance in Aug.

The game looks good, has a huge map that's begging to be explored and I would've loved to explored it, combat is somewhat interesting and refreshing as well. Sadly this is all ruined by the fact that the Devs can't get a working game to peform correctly. The game has failed few times in the past, yet here we are. I got no clue of why they failed but what I do know is that if you fail, you learn from your mistakes. Here that doesn't seem to exist.

Why bother throwing out packs that give customers access to the game 2 days early before official release date when the servers are wank, fps is shockingly poor and loading screen freezes???

Vorab; Ich spiele seit Dark Age of Camelot MMORPGs und hab somit fast bei jedem größeren MMORPG der letzen 15 Jahre reingeschaut, zu 90% auch direkt zum Headstart, nicht selten auch Alphas und Beta´s.

Kommen wir aber zu Bless Online:

Wie die meisten bereits wissen ist Bless Online im Grunde kein neues Spiel, als solches wurde es aber auch nie vermarktet. Diesen Punkt muss man Neowiz also gutschreiben, leider ist dies auch der einzige Pluspunkt, den ich Neowiz für Bless Online geben kann.

Es wurde eine stark angepasste Version für den westlichen Markt angekündigt, die Preformance sollte ebenfalls stark überarbeitet werden, diese hatten seit 2011 nämlich in sämtlichen Neuauflagen starke Probleme. Ein weiterer Punkt, der uns Spielern offeriert wurde was das großartige, neue Kampfsystem das Bless zum release im Westen erhalten sollte. Eine Lokalisation in den jeweiligen Sprachen wurde ebenfall versprochen, alle Texte sollten somit hier auf Deutsch wiedergegeben werden. 

Mit diesen Aussagen konnten sich vermutlich die meisten hungrigen MMORPG Fans anfreunden, denn viel Alternative gibt es derzeit nicht, ausser alt bewehrtes. Es kommen zwar so einige Interessante Spiele raus in naher Zukunft aber auch eben erst in den nächsten Monaten bis hin Ende 2019. Bless Online wäre also für viele zumindest eine super Alternative bis zum nächsten Release geworden oder eben Ihr neues Hauptspiel.


Somit standen doch alle Tore offen für Bless hier im Westen, oder? Ich sage jetzt einfach; Ja! Wir wollten Bless, wir wollten Bless so wie es versprochen und geteasert war!

Was ist jetzt mit Bless Online? Was haben wir Spieler im Westen bekommen?
Eine Katastrophe die so lange nicht mehr gesehen wurde, ich würde fast von Scam sprechen, gerade für uns die wir für 2 Tage Headstart ordentlich Geld gezahlt haben oder gar die armen Hunde die sogar zur Collecters oder Deluxe Version gegriffen haben - sorry Leute!

Wenn ich sage Katastrophe meine ich damit nicht den misslungen Start, die Server Lags, Abstürze, Disconects, Bugs und Hot Fixes in den ersten 24 Stunden die bis jetzt anhalten - wie gesagt ich spiele seit 15 Jahren MMORPGs und ich weiß wie ein Release in der Größe abläuft. Its like; never play on patchday / Release day. ;)

Das was ich meine geht viel tiefer in die Illusion und den Hype, der hier sehr clever inszeniert wurde und das was letztlich geliefert wurde. Alles fängt schon beim Marketing und der Kommunikation an. Es wurde im Grunde ja nie große Werbung gemacht für Bless Online - richtig? Keine Dicken Aufhänger auf einschlägigen Internetseiten, keine Youtube Werbung, keine Pop Ups beim Surfen... da war eigentlich nichts, nichts an das ich mich erinnere.
Man hat es geschafft durch ""wir arbeiten hart am Spiel"" ""bald fertig"" das Interesse zu wecken und Viral zu gehen, es gibt heute keine bessere Werbung als wenn Youtuber und Streamer etwas viral machen, das Interesse wecken und genau das war hier der Fall. Man hat einfach das Interesse der Leute, den Hunger nach einem neuen MMORPG im Westen greifen lassen und die Werbung lief von selbst.
dazu gab es nur wenige fundamentale Aussagen und Infos von Neowiz und wie weit das Spiel jetzt genau war, war eigentlich bis zum Ende auch nie bekannt. Also wurde ich immer heißer und neugieriger, genau wie Ihr denke ich, oder.
Aber außer Fan Theorien oder Vermutungen von großen MMO Sites gab es nicht viel. Erst 2 Wochen vor Release am 28.05.2018 wurden Videos gezeigt, in dem das Kampsystem zu sehen war - 2 Wochen vor Release! Ebenso zum Bezahlmodell oder den Packs oder gar dem genauen Release Termin. Man hat gewartet bis Ihr / wir so richtig heiß waren und blind ins Boot springen würden - es hat gepasst. Dazu der ""Emissär"" Hype und hey.. selbst der move ist gelungen.
Im Bereich der Vermarktung und im Bereich der Foren, Discord, Community Verwaltung arbeiten jetzt zu 90% Menschen kostenlos via dem Emissär Programm, keine gelernten Branchen Mitarbeiter.  Dazu kommt das vermutlich 50% der Leute völlig ungeeignet sind, sich damit nur selbst profilieren möchten (mods und community mods) oder sich einen Vorteil daraus erhoffen (content streamer). Neowiz freut sich, es ging weiter viral und kosten tut es auch nichts! Noch immer klingelten bei keinem von uns die Alarmglocken, oder nur bei wenigen... bei mir leider nicht, erst jetzt denn Professionalität sieht anders aus bei einem selbsternannten AAA Game.

Nun aber zum Spiel:
Grafik und Performance: Das Spiel sieht auch im Steam Release aus wie ein Spiel das eben schon 2011 das erste Mal auf den Markt gekommen ist, es wurde sicherlich im Laufe der Jahre angepasst aber man merkt deutlich das es technisch veraltet ist was die Präsentation angeht. Die Chars sind meist sehr gut aufgelöst und scharf in Szene gesetzt aber gerade bei der Umgebung bekommt man HD Texturen und hier rede ich von HD nicht einmal von FHD. Ähnlich wie man es aus PUBG kennt, den Pixelbrei der dann Felsen etc. darstellen soll.
Das könnte man dulden, wenn es zu Gunsten der FPS geht, tut es aber nicht das Spiel ist auf 62 FPS cap und kann native nur bis 1920x1080 Pixel auflösen, also FHD. Wer WQHD oder 21:9 spielt hat ein Problem... dazu kommt die nicht flüssige Performance. Die FPS sind messy, selbst auf Rigs zB mit 1080 und i7 8700K, und der Netcode schreit förmlich um Hilfe.
Hier wurde nichts, wirklich nichts verbessert oder deutlich überabreitet im Gegenteil, die Japan Version lief bei mir und meiner Gilde um einiges runder (und das aus DE via VPN).
Man bekommt also ein Spiel auf dem technischen Stand von 2011 / 2012 das nicht wie versprochen einer kompletten Kur bzw. einem Lifting unterzogen wurde.
Wie das Ganze dann im Realm VS Realm läuft mit hunderten von Spielern die aufeinander treffen und tausende Animationen gleichzeitig... 

Kampfsystem:
Das Kampfsystem zum Headstart am 28.5. ist mehr als gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber vermutlich Geschmackssache, ich selbst habe nur wenig Zuspruch bis dato gehört. Das neue Action Combat System? Ist nicht verfügbar, gibt es nicht - keine Kommunikation von Neowiz wann und ob es überhaupt kommt.

Lokalisation in die deutsche Sprache:
Kurz - nicht vorhanden! Nur wenige Video Sequenzen wurden untertitelt und das in einem deutsch, das jeden erschaudern lässt. Alles ist auf Englisch, das wäre ja halb so wild aber auch die englischen Texte und Beschreibungen sind aus der Hölle mit Teufelszunge gesprochen, man muss oft raten was denn jetzt gerade verlangt wird. Es ist ein wenig so als ob man via Google Translate mit einem Japaner sprechen möchte, es ist zwar lustig aber am Ende weiß keiner was der andere gesagt hat.


Der EA Start an sich:
Wie gesagt das pure Chaos... nach 5min waren die Server überlastet, man musste instant 2 Sever für EU und NA nachstellen, da Neowiz tatsächlich mit nur einem Server an den Start ging. Dazu gibt es permanent Bugs, Lags, Disconects, Login Probleme und vieles mehr. Wie gesagt, das haben die meisten MMOs zum Start aber in diesem Umfang habe ich das lange nicht mehr erlebt. Die Login Warteschlange gehört eben zum Headstart beim MMORPG dazu... alles andere sollte aber laufen und nicht in diesem Umfang verhunzt sein.


Preispolitik, Supporter Packs, Shop usw:
Hier hat Neowiz den großen Schlag gemacht. Es haben sich tatsächliche Leute die 150 Euro Box gekauft! WoW! Nicht einmal Blizzard hat Collectors Edition zu solchen Preisen gehabt - und hier hätten die Leute nur so gerufen; Take my Money... aber Neowiz hat es sich getraut und gewonnen, viele bereuen den Kauf jetzt bereits. 
Der Shop bietet kein direktes P2W, wer das sagt lügt aber! er bietet wie die teuren Packs eben nicht nur kosmetische Dinge, sondern auch viele InGame Vorteile. Sei es nur das schnellere farmen, Leveln, mehr Gold usw., das macht eine gesunde Ökonomie im Spiel nicht möglich, nicht auf fairer Basis.

First of all,the game has been failed already 4 time right and is pvp focused right?,so a developer before launch a game,EVEN IF IS IN EARLY ACCESS,must have tested the balance and the class dmg overall,before launch it.
This has not happen,they launched the game with 7000 bugs,and a tremendous amount of unbalanced dmg for every class both in pvp and pve.
Today they did an overall nerf of every class in pvp and pve,and it is ridicolus how the game is running now,they did not even bothered to test the class (THAT I REMEMBER ARE ONLY 5 ) before launch that stupid patch and than go sleep.

Technical Review -

- Experienced some log in hiccups and server issues on the first day but I was able to log in and try out the game without trouble after the 2nd maintenance and by joining a new server.

- Frame rate issues and quest bugs that many people bring up was non existent for me so I have no complaint.

- New combat system for Berserker was very good and fluid but the other classes are still in queue on their Action Combat mode which will be coming in the later patch. It is unfortunate that the Action Combat was not included for all the classes, giving the people a wrong impression on how the combat is supposed to work. This should be addressed and implimented as soon as possible.

- Translation on some quests, mainly the tutorial texts, are very confusing and needs to be fixed. Some clarifications on skill texts needs to be made. However, I have not encountered any more translation errors after the beginning phase while progressing the quest.

- Graphics and the music is both impressive but you will definitely need a decent PC to run it at a high setting.

As for my personal Pros and Cons

PROs 

- Detailed and freestyle character customization.
- Fluid animation and fast paced combat,  non-stop chaining of skills available given that you are using the stances correctly.
- Quest dialogues and some open world NPC dialogues are fully voiced.
- Enormous list of tameable pets and mounts to give the players an in-game hobby, and a delightful news for those who likes to dabble in the pet system.
- Pets are more than just a critter following you around. They provide various beneficial skills depending on the pet.
- Interesting story line for the lore enthusiasts. I am very intrigued by the storyline at the moment as I progress through the quests.

CONs

- Slightly high learning curve when it comes to combat as you are forced to think on your toe and use the correct combo/stance at a whim. This might not necessarily be a CON, but I believe many players will find such a combat stressful.
- It is necessary to readjust the hotkeys on many of your basic combo keys in order to fully utilize all the skills at a fast pace, which will definitely be needed for PvP later on.
- Unnecessarily loud echo when talking with NPCs in an indoor environment. It is as if a small room turns into a marble opera house when the NPC starts talking.
- I do not endorse censorship on a game content and ask the developers to rethink their decision on the matter.

HIGH IMPORTANCE

1. Groups of players split apart due to last-minute server adding. Need some merge or transfer system.

2. Lumena and Premium is character bound. It needs to be account bound. Also gathering tools that are part of premium are character bound and can be deleted.

3. Translation of the intro tutorial. A lot of people have issues with the skill mounting portion of the quest because of the bad translation and it's the first impression of the actual game.

4. Action mode is missing from every class besides Berserker.

5. There is no Bless/Neowiz customer support? I have heard of some serious issues which need something like that like being respawned into the enemy capital with recall set there, never being able to get past the loading screen after character select, or having your skillbars vanish every time you change instances.

6. Bless loading screen stuck error. Current rumored fixes: run as administrator, run windowed, keep restarting seems to be only thing confirmed to work.

7. Fixes for some quests that have bugs which prevent progress.

8. Better default optimization settings. You can currently fix it by editing the file but you shouldn't need to do this if we're paying such a huge price.

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE

1. Assassin gear drops/Assassin requirements for daily missions.

2. Class skills need someone to go over them and give a proper translation. Plus some skills have mechanics that aren't listed at all in the skill description that need it.

3. Better skill-queuing. As it is right now it isn't a big thing especially with ground targeted skills and when you miss.

4. German translation isn't fully implemented?

LOW IMPORTANCE

1. Have someone generally go over all of the broken English (you are now 6level etc).

2. Make mouse keys able to be used for keybindings. Make alt+key able to be used for keybindings.

3. Sprint stamina bar? (May exist and I am not aware)

4. A 3rd party healing someone in a duel instantly ends the duel.

5. Give chat a higher character limit (maybe for non global channels) and fix the language filter or give an option to disable it.

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

I did however like that you can tame mounts and pets from the wilderness, that was super cool. Sadly it was the only fun thing to do in this game, shortly after being introduced to this the action bar to tame said pets dissapeared when trying never to come back. The one thing that was fun in the game was broke for me there on out. The combat is lackluster at best and nonfunctional at worst, upgrading skills to make a good fun build in game is impossible with the translation making no sense on 90% of the skills ""Increases the cooldown cooldown, but further reduces cooldown cooldown."" WTF does that even mean. Yes there are third party tools you can get to help you understand them, but when the english patch for the KR version of the game makes more sense the the translations on the steam version you know something is off.

0,34,2,367,367,76561198349649010,0,english,False,42370531,"I decided to give Bless online a try because there was a significant amount of hype within the MMORPG community surrounding this game. Unfortunatly, the hype and exposure is completely unwarrented. Bless Online had the opportunity to be a solid MMO but a plethora of issues are holding it back. I urgently recommend that people do not buy this game. Here's why. 

Optimization:

This game does not run well at all. It's buggy, has serious framerate issues and many players have noted freezes and crashes.

Gameplay: Combat

Bless' gameplay is not good. The tab target combat system in conjunction with the combo system is unreliable and not fun to experience. I played the Gaurdian class during my time with the game and found the whole ability combos and stance systems to be confusing at best. What is the point of these systems? The combat, whilst interesting on paper, does not work well in practice 

Gameplay: Questing

The initial questing seems fine. However, players who have put more hours into the game than me have noted that the questing becomes confusing & boring after about lvl 13

The world: the world of Bless is probably its strongest feature. The geopolitics of the gameworld seem interesting to experience and there is potential for diverse and engaging storylines. Once again, veteran Bless players have said that this does not pan out in mid game. The physical world of Bless is open world and there is potential for exploration and imersion but what is the point of that when the gameplay isn't fun? 

Addressing Early Access:

Don't give this game a free pass because it's in early access. There have been several versions of this game in other countries and they have all fared poorly. What really compounds this issue is the fact that NEOWIZ has had two years to iron out the kinks for the western realease and it seems like they have failed to take advantage. They are scrambling (and making an effort) to fix issues as they community brings them up but after two years and serveral releases one could argue that they should have learned from those experinces and delivered a better product. Server issues are to be expected, but core gameplay problems at this stage are not. They had a chance to make it right and they failed. I think that says alot. 

I refunded this game. You should too.

Problems that are said to have been fixed still exist. There are many minor bugs and a huge performance problem.

Graphically the game is not bad, but in my opinion it can not keep up with TERA or BnS, although they are already older they run more performant. The frame rates collapsed completely in cities and even slightly larger groups of players are enough to reduce the game to under 30 FPS. Although I have a very high-performance system.

Furthermore, the world and the characters in it seem very static.

What bothers me most, however, is the "" reworked "" fighting system. It doesn't feel good, not liquid. It reminds a bit of BnS (at least in the Action Combat Mode), but plays itself extremely fiddly. Especially the new combo system disturbs me immensely. The keys to continue a combo are chosen very imprudently, or in principle the restriction to a given combo is rather hindering than something positive. The combos remind me a bit of TERA, but they can't keep up with the TERA system at all. Everything else in the combat system reminds me of BnS, but the combat system in BnS is also better in itself. In a nutshell, I would say that they tried to unite different fighting systems and created something bad out of it.

The Launch:
In MY opinion Bless got a good launch (I can only speak for the EU Servers and I do know that due to some big streamers and their community influence the US Servers got some issues after launching). Server were up at the communicated time and the whole preload thing that people are talking about is only partly Neowiz fault. Steam only allows preload of specific EA titles not for every EA game, so while Neowiz may have been able to talk more with the Steam about it, it is only partly their fault.
After starting with 1 Server they added 2 more quickly after most players got their game downloaded and added a 4th in the middle of the night. There were 3 announced maintenances in EU (till 29.5 noon) and atleast on Physis (the first EU server) the server only stuttered 2 times, as far as I´m aware. Some people ran into the issue that some servers got there character creation locked and can´t play with their guildmates. While this is in fact frustrating, it´s a thing that every guild leader should have known beforehand because every bloody mmorpg had the same problem before and restricted character creation on the more populated servers to balance the players.

Tl;dr (Launch): Quickly added new servers, only 3 Maintenances which were communicated, not a lot of server stutter.



FPS Drops and graphics: (For reference I got an I7 6700k, 980TI, 16GB DDR4 in my rig)
So enough of the launch experience, let´s look at the next big topic: Optimization.
The UE3 Engine definitely reaches it´s max capacity if you go into a town with dozens of players and the FPS drop massively. That may be one reason why UE3 was never thought for MMORPGS yet here we are. I also got the FPS drops the first time I went to the MainCityHub, were probably >150 players were simultaneously on the plaza, the fps went down to 20 FPS. But after everyone went to do their thing and the player mass spreaded slowly I can now play with constant 80 - 140 FPs in the open world and around 60 FPS in Towns (with shadows activated). I get even more FPS if I deactivate or lower the shadow settings. I won´t say that the cries for bad optimization are a haux but I have to say it isn´t as bad as a lot of people seem it to make. Especcialy if you consider that there are several channels for most towns so you can get away from the masses if you want to.
Yes I am aware that there were other versions of the game out before, but these games were mostly mode by another Dev Team.
Yes I am aware that UE3 is old and has it´s flaws. Nobody will deny that. But ffs while PUBG, Fortnite and other UE4 Games wich render a lot of players at the same time, were and are still not entirely optimized, so just imagine what would happen if Neowiz had decided to go for a change to UE4. Yeah it would have probably looked better but the FPS wouldn´t change. And people saying: But BNS is also doing it: BNS shows only a handful of players in a channel and locks it if a certain point is reached. So there won´t be as many players on a single channel in BNS as on the plaza of the MainCities in Bless. I can´t say anything for castle sieges etc because there weren´t any yet. But nobody should be able to give a definitive feedback for that yet.
Overall the graphics got an updated texture here and there, and you got your nice places which look really good. But there is also a lot of times where you just see that it is an older game.

Tl;dr (FPS Drops): Yeah there is an issue but it is not as bad as a whole lot of people are claiming it to be. It´s mostly just that bad if you are standing in the middle between everyone else and have the shadows activated. While leveling or after the mass of player slowly spreads, the FPS do rise to normal levels again. Graphic looks are ok for an UE3 game.


Translation:
I will make that short: read the other reviews. The translation of the story is ok and the translation of skills and other things is bad. Nothing else to tell you here expect a reminder that it was the same for BNS, BDO and other Korean games.

Combat Gameplay:
No ActionCombat for all classes: While the trailer showed ActionCombat footage for I believe all classes I can´t remember if Neowiz told anywhere that it would be there with EA launch. But I´m not sure so I will just say: If you only want to play Bless for the ActionCombat, wait or refund or whatever. Expect for Beserker it isn´t implemented yet and while on reddit was a ticket posted that showed that it will be implemented in the future it isn´t here yet. So if that is a deal breaker for you, react accordingly.
Reworked ComboCombat: I really like the new Combo System and it has a good amount of depths with stance swapping and some other features to give you a lot to play with, especcially in PVP. But in the end it is something that every player got another opinion about, like with every other Combat System.

PVP:
So I can only comment on some open world PVP yet. So far PVP was fun. There were fights which were pretty one sided but most fights where pretty close and interesting. I won´t comment on any balance between classes because everyone is still leveling etc. But I can say so far that I got wrecked by every class and also destroyed every class, so atleast while everyone is leveling there isn´t a class which dominates everything.

PVE:
You got your normal Mob Grind, some solo dungeons, some party dungeons and so far while it isn´t the most entertaining PVE, it is by far not the worst. Can´t say more about it till I saw the endgame Dungeons, but so far it is looking ok. (Keep in mind that the first raids, if I´m not mistaken, will first appear with the level 50 levelcap and aren´t to be expected while we have the current level 45 levelcap)

Quests:
- Main Story Quest Chain: I don´t really care about it, but some people told me that they actually liked the story. So it´s again completly subjective
- Side Quests: Generic MMORPG side quests so nothing fancy here
- Hunting Quests: Every Mob you kill can trigger a hunting quest that pretty much rewards your for grinding that mob. E.G: You kill a bandit, that triggers the hunting quest. First Tier of the Quest kill 12 bandits -> rewards exp, Second Tier of the Quest kill 30 bandits -> rewards exp, Third Tier of the Quest kill 60 bandits -> rewards exp and some upgrade materials. So it´s just a nice addon for your normal MMO Grinding Experience.

Cash Shop:
So far only costumes and the announced small boosters and premium subscription is in the cash shop. So nothing which is hard P2W. (You can convert ingame currencies for cash shop curreny in a fair manner as far as I have seen, so everyone can get some boosters or the dove pretty easily.) 
Just a heads up: The fact that Lumena (premium currency) are Character bound is a bug and will be fixed.

Launch issues:
There is currently a problem with launching the game, where you are stuck on a splas screen. This is a problem like everybody else already wrote and is currently bein investigated by Neowiz, so again it is a bug which will be fixed.


-------

Conclusion: Bless Online got some issues, nobody can deny that and nobody should. But so got a ton of other games, especially MMORPGs. I really like the game so far. While it seems that it isn´t up for everyones standards (sadly the number of negative reviews is pretty big), I didn´t find a reason why I shouldn´t like the game yet. Maybe I´m just more realistic than others with what a launch experiences of MMORPGS even in 2018 are, but that is something everybody has to deal with him- or herself.
I can only encourage everyone to give the game a chance and some time (nobody forces anyone to play on launch day). And maybe someone else will finally find a nice MMORPG in Bless,after trying dozens of others, like I did.",True,1527629626,1527630012,True,0,2,0.503115,True

I've played MMOs since EverQuest in 1999... played a lot of alphas, betas, and early access titles over the years....

The devs are passionate it seems, I'll give them that, but given how long this game has been in development (announced in 2011), it's a bit sad how poorly it is optimized, how bad the servers are (after launches in other regions, they should have a handle on it by now), and how convoluted (in some cases unbearably bland) some of the game systems are this far along. It's inexcusable tbh... one example is that it takes ages to open the game because the launcher takes forever to even open it, then you're lucky if you can get past the ""Bless Online"" splash screen to select your server/character. Takes multiple attempts and can sometimes take ~20+ minutes to even get into the game.

Then on top of that, once you do, it takes forever for the game to run smoothly. This is on a system with an i7, 16gb RAM, and a 1070, on average or even below average in game settings. For a game that was announced in 2011 (so likely 10 years in dev), that's inexcusable. I'm sorry. It rarely hits a solid 60fps. Terrain/models load late af. Supposedly there are fixes online, but seriously, you shouldn't have to go and edit config files to get a steady framerate on a game that has been in dev for at least 7 years, if not 10+, that is running on an already outdated engine.

It'd be slightly more forgivable if they didn't remove a lot of the NPCs and assets from their game world during their pre-release press event to make it seem like the game was optimized better. They gave some excuse, saying something like ""oh, ______ just isn't finished yet"". In hind sight, this was a blatant lie to boost sales.

Don't be fooled by the early access title (it isn't, multiple failed launches already. though the community will try to insist it is)... and understand that although some of its core systems are designed like a more western MMO, it still has the underlying Korean grind in some of its mechanics. The gameplay loop is EXTREMELY repetitive, even compared with other MMOs I'd consider repetitive. The gear enhancing grind will involve you running the same handful of instances over and over at endgame for mats to do so, the same two dungeons for gear, and last I checked, there was only one raid on the Korean servers, and the game has been out for quite some time over there now.

The fastest way (more importantly, only way) to progress in this game is via dungeon spamming, which is never good for an MMO's open world (it makes for some PVP hotspots since you have to run to the instance, which is good imo, but still), and the mechanics are mindnumbingly boring and easy when compared to other MMOs. The only thing that makes them somewhat difficult is how enemies and gear scale... you better like running the same dungeon 10-20 times in a row (if not more), even during the leveling process. This is compounded by the fact that you outlevel side quests far too quickly, and their XP / rewards are hardly worth it. The gear variety and its means of acquisition are also insanely bland. Gear also degrades when you repair it. Hope you like those boring ass dungeons. It'd be fine if there was degradation OR enhancing, NOT both.

Good weapons only drop from ""elite"" monsters, so enjoy fighting everyone for a level appropriate weapon, since you don't get credit for tagging like you do in most other games these days, and the spawns are very limited. I can deal with not being guaranteed a drop for my class, and actually prefer it that way if the mob/boss mechanics are remotely interesting... but as I said, they aren't. To boot, you can't even mail gear for other classes to your alts or trade it to friends. When the boss fights are difficult (which happens rarely, most are very easy, I'd imagine this is class dependent), if it can even be called that, they are for the wrong reasons due to how gear scaling works, the mechanics are mindnumbingly easy.


The game is optimized so poorly, I don't even want to imagine GvG, territory control, or their ""100v100"" battles.

For what it's worth, I played on the Korean servers and not much has changed at all. They redid the combat and skill trees a little bit, that's about it. And tbh, I prefer the old system in a lot of ways. The new skill tree system is overly convoluted (build diversity/complexity is good, but not packaged like this), grindy, and not explained very well. The new combat system is a bit more flashy, but feels worse to play, partially because it can be unresponsive (not talking about network lag), the skills and their energy costs / cooldowns just feel bad, the windows of time you have to use some skills can feel too short (kinda good as it adds a level of skill, but when the system is generally unresponsive it feels horrible), charged skills don't trigger properly when you hold down the key. Inability to use certain keybinds and animation locks make moving and comboing far too complicated, and sometimes it's impossible to move out of AOEs, even if you're not animation locked. You'll often find yourself needing a stun or cc immediately, and not have access to it quickly enough, or it'll still be on cooldown due to how fast respawns can sometimes be (it makes some sense for PVP balance). I could go on. It definitely needs work.

I will say that you should keep your eye on this game to see if it eventually becomes something more unique, but in all honesty, there are other games that do everything this one does better. And I'd be very surprised if it reaches its full potential before some of the 'next gen' MMOs release and outshine it.

I cannot honestly recommend the game in the state it is in, as it is inexcusable given how long the game has been in development. Keep your eye on it, that's about all I can recommend, but there are already better MMOs out, and better ones in development.

IF the game reaches its full potential, fixes its optimization issues (the worst I've ever seen, especially for a game in dev this long) and loses some of the Korean-style grind, I'd more readily recommend it.

But sadly, my prediction is that it will remain unoptimized, keep the Korean-style grind systems along with the very repetitive gameplay loop, and likely go p2w by August, and probably be dead by Q4.

I've played MMOs for a long time, and I wanted to believe that NeoWiz would deliver us something good because they seem passionate, but I've been down that road before with plenty of MMOs, and it always ends the same way.

If they prove me wrong, then fantastic. But I don't expect that to be the case. This is likely just them trying to regain their losses after failed attempts in other regions, just as I originally expected. It could potentially be amazing in a year or two, but do NOT waste your money right now, unless you're so desperate for a new MMO, you're willing to buy into another 'maybe one day' MMORPG. Personally, I've had enough of those and cheap, p2w KR MMO cash grabs.

The community is delusional in saying that this is better than other games on the market, and that this is ""normal for early access"". Sure, if the game was ACTUALLY new. The thing is, it isn't. Assuming it's been in dev for ~10 years, it's absolutely inexcusable how poorly it runs, how convoluted its systems are, and how  bland other systems are.

A lot of the players are likely going through that phase of ""I've been waiting for this game for so long and it's finally out! I already spent my money, so let me illogically defend it!"" phase. Not to mention the community is generally worse than most other MMOs, with a few exceptions. Think BDO global chat, perhaps not quite as bad yet.

The story and voice acting are decent though, when your character isn't doing a T-Pose during the cutscences anyway.

(For a more detaild version read below)

[b]The Good Stuff:[/b]
-[u]Combat System[/u] is actually smooth and interesting, I had a great time playing and learning my character and it has potential and from what I hear most of the flaws people are talking about is because they are inexperienced and too afraid to try new things out.. as in they are used to other styles of MMO's combat systems and compare it to them, and it works but you have to remember they are testing something new, it wont be for everyone but as it is now its working and its fun to learn and play with and comparing it to other MMO's wont help it it get better it will just scare away people. It rewards people who know their characters instead of just rewarding you for having great gear. its a bit unbalanced but thats something that will be fixed.
-[u]The Developers[/u], most people are blaming them and hating on them but I think they are doing a good job. We been so excited for a ""new"" MMO and I know this was a let down for some people but that doesnt mean its their fault, no game is perfect for everyone so even if you dont like it no need to hate and blame them for whats going on. They are actually working really hard, adressing the problems and listening to the community. You can see that easily if you just check their website or their launcher, all the information is there. they have been working hard to adjust the game for the EU/NA release and after issues they been fast (Most of the times) to either adress them or note it down. it takes time to fix stuff so give them time and if you dont like it whats out yet then dont play the game check it out in a bit when they have adressed and fixed whats wrong.
-[u]Pet System[/u] its actually really fun, nothing you should dive into at the start of the game. Its meant to be a ""side buff project"" you can do when you wanna try do different stuff. Try get some mounts or pets, farm skills and yes its RNG and many hate that but I find it good both for the market and also for the replayability, people want it easy these days and I dont think that fits in a MMO. You should work for stuff, play the time needed and when you get the loot/pefect pet or whatever youre looking for then that reward should make you happy.
-[u]P2W?[/u] no it's not. Its rewarding you for playing the game, yes you can use money to get skins and premium but premium isnt as bad as people think, if they play the game they will understand. By playing the game you can convert your PVE and PVP tokens to the ""P2W"" currency tho its limited to 50 per day but that just makes so by playing in some time then you can get the skin you want or that extra like of inventory slots (You get some from quests too so its not that bad). I have seen no P2W aspects so far atleast, who knows what the will happen in the future but so far so good.

[b]The Bad Stuff:[/b]
(Most of the stuff here is what the norm is talking about, and I will briefly explain the problem and situation.)
-[u]Poor translation[/u]. Yes, the game have some weird and bad translation problems now and then but it doesnt effect the gameplay that much, you can put 1 and 1 together to understand what they mean. I find it kinda funny when a skill says ""increase cooldown cooldown"" but we know what it actually does. Translation is not a main priority for the game so I believe it will be fixed in the future.
-[u]Poor Censoring[/u], its kinda annoying but I see it as the translation. Its not a main priority. So **ain, this probably will be adressed later on.
-[u]Launch[/u] was not as bad as people make it sound like. Servers had some problems but they tried to fix it with a responce by adding 
more servers and limiting the trafics to the overpopulated servers to spread out the player base so it would be less ""laggy"".
many say its ""The Worse Launch ever"" but thats not even close to it. It was doable and when you got away from the crowd it was fine. 
-[u]Poor optimization[/u]. The game runs solid on 62 fps when you normally play the game, going to over crowded places or something like that. If someone says ""I have I7 8800k and GTX 1080"" then they dont really understand what the problem is. Its not their components, its the settings because its hard capped in settings that arent using the components to their full potential and some of the settings are lowered so they can expand and improve it as they move forward. I agree tho that it should have been looked into and they should have worked harder to push the ""quality"" for the release. 
Theres guides to fix this problem to so IF you have problems they can be fixed to some degree.
-[u]The Players[/u], most players now are mostly crying and begin negative in the chat, instead of actually giving the game feedback. Half of the community is saying ""IT will get better, its early access"" and some people are saying ""it wont get better and you cant blame early access"", here's my view on it. IT will get better as long as we give them a chance, feedback and our thoughts about the game. the game IS in early access and that means stuff will change, improve and they have shown that they are willing to do that and listen to us. I feel like even if youre not happy about how it turned out. be atleast a good person and give the developers feedback instead of hating, harassing and scaring away other people by oversaturating what really happened.


If you dont agree with me feel then free to leave a comment or feel free to add me if theres more information you wanna know or if theres something i've missed, if you agree with me then shead some light on my review so other people can see what the game is really about, so they dont get scared because of the hiccups it had at launch that triggered some people off.

First of all, the game has some issues for a lot of players. Name an MMO that had a glorious launch on their first 26 hrs?
I thought so, none. Bless Online is a fun not P2W game to play. It has a  a very engaging Lore/Storyline. I run the game at 60fps constantly with no problems at 4k resolution. Sometimes it drops to 50 until it loads everything on the city, then back to 60 fps.

The battle system could use a bit more tweaking as the action combat mode is only available for Berserker. They are currently working on the others for a future update. Most of this negative reviews are from players that barely had 10 mins in game and spent more than an hr trying to go past the Bless screen bug. Instead of giving the devs time to fix the Issues they jump on the troll bandwagon.

I've been disconected multiple times, got stuck on loading screen and was unable to progress some quest due to lag.
Would I recommend Bless Online? Absolutely! Its been only 26 hrs of founders access and they are doing their best on stabilizing the game for the players. Honestly I would say give it a week for the game take off if your still on the fence about buying it. I chose to not Refund and have faith on a company that is doing their best to publish the game they so hardly worked for, because they love their creation. If not they would not be releasing this for a fourth time as a Global release.

If anything, playing this game has shown me just how sad the MMO gaming community has become. People unable to think their way out of a paper bag:
- People literally unable to finish the tutorial because it requires you to pres three (3) buttons.
-People spamming chat with ""How do I get my mount more stamina""
-People spamming chat with ""How so I tame pets""
-People spamming chat with ""How do I fast travel?""

ALL of these things are explained to you within the first 20 minutes of questing.......do the quest, play the game, and learn it.

People complaing that you can't teleport and have to walk everywhere....

People complaining about CD's being too long.

The MMO community today just wants button mashing hyper speed combat that requires little to no thinking and relies primarily on having better gear.

If you're looking for an older feel to an MMO where you have to walk everywhere, your griffon mounts actually require you to sit on the griffon for 20 minutes to get from point to point. And combat relies more on CD management and positioning than twitch button mashing reflex, then this is a solid choice.

As for the performance issues, I am almost certain these are just trolls bandwagoning on other trolls. I have a 1060 and get a constant 50+ FPS with 20+ in town. People in chat claiming they have dual 1080ti's and cant get over 15 FPS need to get a refund on their 3rd party cards....because they don't work.

Also, this game is about PvP...which means it's about the faction war in the end game. Yes there are dungeons that link into the story line, but they are pretty simple dungeons.....

Don't know what the end game dungeons and raids will be like...I do indeed hope they get harder though.

I'd give it a solid 7/10 right now for what it is. It's nothing revelutionary....but then again, it never claimed to be. It's an old school experience that does what its trying to do well. 

There are server issues, but that's pretty much every launch nowadays. Once performance issues pan out I'd say its a good 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10 once all the other classes come into play.

Besides, any time someone try's something new and revolutionary (Star Citizen), everyone just goes crazy and yells about how its a scam and cant be done. 

Really, it's just the community. These teenagers nowadays lack any form of critical thinking and then wonder why they are all dropping out of college or cant make it into graduate programs. Just go be a youtube star....that 800 bucks a year will cover your needs until you make....keep trying....hopefully you starve out sooner or later and your absence from the gene pool can hel progress the species.",True,1527629067,1527629284,True,0,0,0.000000,True

Technical Review -

- Experienced some log in hiccups and server issues on the first day but I was able to log in and try out the game without trouble after the 2nd maintenance and by joining a new server.

- Frame rate issues and quest bugs that many people bring up was non existent for me so I have no complaint.

- New combat system for Berserker was very good and fluid but the other classes are still in queue on their Action Combat mode which will be coming in the later patch. It is unfortunate that the Action Combat was not included for all the classes, giving the people a wrong impression on how the combat is supposed to work. This should be addressed and implimented as soon as possible.

- Translation on some quests, mainly the tutorial texts, are very confusing and needs to be fixed. Some clarifications on skill texts needs to be made. However, I have not encountered any more translation errors after the beginning phase while progressing the quest.

- Graphics and the music is both impressive but you will definitely need a decent PC to run it at a high setting.

As for my personal Pros and Cons

PROs 

- Detailed and freestyle character customization.
- Fluid animation and fast paced combat,  non-stop chaining of skills available given that you are using the stances correctly.
- Quest dialogues and some open world NPC dialogues are fully voiced.
- Enormous list of tameable pets and mounts to give the players an in-game hobby, and a delightful news for those who likes to dabble in the pet system.
- Pets are more than just a critter following you around. They provide various beneficial skills depending on the pet.
- Interesting story line for the lore enthusiasts. I am very intrigued by the storyline at the moment as I progress through the quests.

CONs

- Slightly high learning curve when it comes to combat as you are forced to think on your toe and use the correct combo/stance at a whim. This might not necessarily be a CON, but I believe many players will find such a combat stressful.
- It is necessary to readjust the hotkeys on many of your basic combo keys in order to fully utilize all the skills at a fast pace, which will definitely be needed for PvP later on.
- Unnecessarily loud echo when talking with NPCs in an indoor environment. It is as if a small room turns into a marble opera house when the NPC starts talking.
- I do not endorse censorship on a game content and ask the developers to rethink their decision on the matter.

Game is good people complaing about server problems this is why we have EA
yes game could be better but no mmo thats out right now is really good
unless you go to wow etc but they all had sakey launches aswell
Id say if you want to play it and can accept it has its problems atm go for it or maybe hold off wait for a few updates
the towns looking amazing combat is really good 
changing stance is something new that you can do on the fly and doesnt cost you anything to do it
The game has a good future

HIGH IMPORTANCE

1. Groups of players split apart due to last-minute server adding. Need some merge or transfer system.

2. Lumena and Premium is character bound. It needs to be account bound. Also gathering tools that are part of premium are character bound and can be deleted.

3. Translation of the intro tutorial. A lot of people have issues with the skill mounting portion of the quest because of the bad translation and it's the first impression of the actual game.

4. Action mode is missing from every class besides Berserker.

5. There is no Bless/Neowiz customer support? I have heard of some serious issues which need something like that like being respawned into the enemy capital with recall set there, never being able to get past the loading screen after character select, or having your skillbars vanish every time you change instances.

6. Bless loading screen stuck error. Current rumored fixes: run as administrator, run windowed, keep restarting seems to be only thing confirmed to work.

7. Fixes for some quests that have bugs which prevent progress.

8. Better default optimization settings. You can currently fix it by editing the file but you shouldn't need to do this if we're paying such a huge price.

MEDIUM IMPORTANCE

1. Assassin gear drops/Assassin requirements for daily missions.

2. Class skills need someone to go over them and give a proper translation. Plus some skills have mechanics that aren't listed at all in the skill description that need it.

3. Better skill-queuing. As it is right now it isn't a big thing especially with ground targeted skills and when you miss.

4. German translation isn't fully implemented?

LOW IMPORTANCE

1. Have someone generally go over all of the broken English (you are now 6level etc).

2. Make mouse keys able to be used for keybindings. Make alt+key able to be used for keybindings.

3. Sprint stamina bar? (May exist and I am not aware)

4. A 3rd party healing someone in a duel instantly ends the duel.

5. Give chat a higher character limit (maybe for non global channels) and fix the language filter or give an option to disable it.

POTENTIAL PROBLEMS

Miss/resist/block/stuns etc stopping combos. Not sure how much future accuracy and stats at endgame will affect this but I could see a lot of people ragequitting over this.

I can get passed the server issues, every MMO launch has those, but the game breaking optimization and blatent lie of what the combat would be I cannot overlook.

I did however like that you can tame mounts and pets from the wilderness, that was super cool. Sadly it was the only fun thing to do in this game, shortly after being introduced to this the action bar to tame said pets dissapeared when trying never to come back. The one thing that was fun in the game was broke for me there on out. The combat is lackluster at best and nonfunctional at worst, upgrading skills to make a good fun build in game is impossible with the translation making no sense on 90% of the skills ""Increases the cooldown cooldown, but further reduces cooldown cooldown."" WTF does that even mean. Yes there are third party tools you can get to help you understand them, but when the english patch for the KR version of the game makes more sense the the translations on the steam version you know something is off.

0,34,2,367,367,76561198349649010,0,english,False,42370531,"I decided to give Bless online a try because there was a significant amount of hype within the MMORPG community surrounding this game. Unfortunatly, the hype and exposure is completely unwarrented. Bless Online had the opportunity to be a solid MMO but a plethora of issues are holding it back. I urgently recommend that people do not buy this game. Here's why. 

Optimization:

This game does not run well at all. It's buggy, has serious framerate issues and many players have noted freezes and crashes.

Gameplay: Combat

Bless' gameplay is not good. The tab target combat system in conjunction with the combo system is unreliable and not fun to experience. I played the Gaurdian class during my time with the game and found the whole ability combos and stance systems to be confusing at best. What is the point of these systems? The combat, whilst interesting on paper, does not work well in practice 

Gameplay: Questing

The initial questing seems fine. However, players who have put more hours into the game than me have noted that the questing becomes confusing & boring after about lvl 13

The world: the world of Bless is probably its strongest feature. The geopolitics of the gameworld seem interesting to experience and there is potential for diverse and engaging storylines. Once again, veteran Bless players have said that this does not pan out in mid game. The physical world of Bless is open world and there is potential for exploration and imersion but what is the point of that when the gameplay isn't fun? 

Addressing Early Access:

Don't give this game a free pass because it's in early access. There have been several versions of this game in other countries and they have all fared poorly. What really compounds this issue is the fact that NEOWIZ has had two years to iron out the kinks for the western realease and it seems like they have failed to take advantage. They are scrambling (and making an effort) to fix issues as they community brings them up but after two years and serveral releases one could argue that they should have learned from those experinces and delivered a better product. Server issues are to be expected, but core gameplay problems at this stage are not. They had a chance to make it right and they failed. I think that says alot. 

I refunded this game. You should too.

Problems that are said to have been fixed still exist. There are many minor bugs and a huge performance problem.

Graphically the game is not bad, but in my opinion it can not keep up with TERA or BnS, although they are already older they run more performant. The frame rates collapsed completely in cities and even slightly larger groups of players are enough to reduce the game to under 30 FPS. Although I have a very high-performance system.

Furthermore, the world and the characters in it seem very static.

What bothers me most, however, is the "" reworked "" fighting system. It doesn't feel good, not liquid. It reminds a bit of BnS (at least in the Action Combat Mode), but plays itself extremely fiddly. Especially the new combo system disturbs me immensely. The keys to continue a combo are chosen very imprudently, or in principle the restriction to a given combo is rather hindering than something positive. The combos remind me a bit of TERA, but they can't keep up with the TERA system at all. Everything else in the combat system reminds me of BnS, but the combat system in BnS is also better in itself. In a nutshell, I would say that they tried to unite different fighting systems and created something bad out of it.

The Launch:
In MY opinion Bless got a good launch (I can only speak for the EU Servers and I do know that due to some big streamers and their community influence the US Servers got some issues after launching). Server were up at the communicated time and the whole preload thing that people are talking about is only partly Neowiz fault. Steam only allows preload of specific EA titles not for every EA game, so while Neowiz may have been able to talk more with the Steam about it, it is only partly their fault.
After starting with 1 Server they added 2 more quickly after most players got their game downloaded and added a 4th in the middle of the night. There were 3 announced maintenances in EU (till 29.5 noon) and atleast on Physis (the first EU server) the server only stuttered 2 times, as far as I´m aware. Some people ran into the issue that some servers got there character creation locked and can´t play with their guildmates. While this is in fact frustrating, it´s a thing that every guild leader should have known beforehand because every bloody mmorpg had the same problem before and restricted character creation on the more populated servers to balance the players.

Tl;dr (Launch): Quickly added new servers, only 3 Maintenances which were communicated, not a lot of server stutter.



FPS Drops and graphics: (For reference I got an I7 6700k, 980TI, 16GB DDR4 in my rig)
So enough of the launch experience, let´s look at the next big topic: Optimization.
The UE3 Engine definitely reaches it´s max capacity if you go into a town with dozens of players and the FPS drop massively. That may be one reason why UE3 was never thought for MMORPGS yet here we are. I also got the FPS drops the first time I went to the MainCityHub, were probably >150 players were simultaneously on the plaza, the fps went down to 20 FPS. But after everyone went to do their thing and the player mass spreaded slowly I can now play with constant 80 - 140 FPs in the open world and around 60 FPS in Towns (with shadows activated). I get even more FPS if I deactivate or lower the shadow settings. I won´t say that the cries for bad optimization are a haux but I have to say it isn´t as bad as a lot of people seem it to make. Especcialy if you consider that there are several channels for most towns so you can get away from the masses if you want to.
Yes I am aware that there were other versions of the game out before, but these games were mostly mode by another Dev Team.
Yes I am aware that UE3 is old and has it´s flaws. Nobody will deny that. But ffs while PUBG, Fortnite and other UE4 Games wich render a lot of players at the same time, were and are still not entirely optimized, so just imagine what would happen if Neowiz had decided to go for a change to UE4. Yeah it would have probably looked better but the FPS wouldn´t change. And people saying: But BNS is also doing it: BNS shows only a handful of players in a channel and locks it if a certain point is reached. So there won´t be as many players on a single channel in BNS as on the plaza of the MainCities in Bless. I can´t say anything for castle sieges etc because there weren´t any yet. But nobody should be able to give a definitive feedback for that yet.
Overall the graphics got an updated texture here and there, and you got your nice places which look really good. But there is also a lot of times where you just see that it is an older game.

Tl;dr (FPS Drops): Yeah there is an issue but it is not as bad as a whole lot of people are claiming it to be. It´s mostly just that bad if you are standing in the middle between everyone else and have the shadows activated. While leveling or after the mass of player slowly spreads, the FPS do rise to normal levels again. Graphic looks are ok for an UE3 game.


Translation:
I will make that short: read the other reviews. The translation of the story is ok and the translation of skills and other things is bad. Nothing else to tell you here expect a reminder that it was the same for BNS, BDO and other Korean games.

Combat Gameplay:
No ActionCombat for all classes: While the trailer showed ActionCombat footage for I believe all classes I can´t remember if Neowiz told anywhere that it would be there with EA launch. But I´m not sure so I will just say: If you only want to play Bless for the ActionCombat, wait or refund or whatever. Expect for Beserker it isn´t implemented yet and while on reddit was a ticket posted that showed that it will be implemented in the future it isn´t here yet. So if that is a deal breaker for you, react accordingly.
Reworked ComboCombat: I really like the new Combo System and it has a good amount of depths with stance swapping and some other features to give you a lot to play with, especcially in PVP. But in the end it is something that every player got another opinion about, like with every other Combat System.

PVP:
So I can only comment on some open world PVP yet. So far PVP was fun. There were fights which were pretty one sided but most fights where pretty close and interesting. I won´t comment on any balance between classes because everyone is still leveling etc. But I can say so far that I got wrecked by every class and also destroyed every class, so atleast while everyone is leveling there isn´t a class which dominates everything.

PVE:
You got your normal Mob Grind, some solo dungeons, some party dungeons and so far while it isn´t the most entertaining PVE, it is by far not the worst. Can´t say more about it till I saw the endgame Dungeons, but so far it is looking ok. (Keep in mind that the first raids, if I´m not mistaken, will first appear with the level 50 levelcap and aren´t to be expected while we have the current level 45 levelcap)

Quests:
- Main Story Quest Chain: I don´t really care about it, but some people told me that they actually liked the story. So it´s again completly subjective
- Side Quests: Generic MMORPG side quests so nothing fancy here
- Hunting Quests: Every Mob you kill can trigger a hunting quest that pretty much rewards your for grinding that mob. E.G: You kill a bandit, that triggers the hunting quest. First Tier of the Quest kill 12 bandits -> rewards exp, Second Tier of the Quest kill 30 bandits -> rewards exp, Third Tier of the Quest kill 60 bandits -> rewards exp and some upgrade materials. So it´s just a nice addon for your normal MMO Grinding Experience.

Cash Shop:
So far only costumes and the announced small boosters and premium subscription is in the cash shop. So nothing which is hard P2W. (You can convert ingame currencies for cash shop curreny in a fair manner as far as I have seen, so everyone can get some boosters or the dove pretty easily.) 
Just a heads up: The fact that Lumena (premium currency) are Character bound is a bug and will be fixed.

Launch issues:
There is currently a problem with launching the game, where you are stuck on a splas screen. This is a problem like everybody else already wrote and is currently bein investigated by Neowiz, so again it is a bug which will be fixed.

Conclusion: Bless Online got some issues, nobody can deny that and nobody should. But so got a ton of other games, especially MMORPGs. I really like the game so far. While it seems that it isn´t up for everyones standards (sadly the number of negative reviews is pretty big), I didn´t find a reason why I shouldn´t like the game yet. Maybe I´m just more realistic than others with what a launch experiences of MMORPGS even in 2018 are, but that is something everybody has to deal with him- or herself.
I can only encourage everyone to give the game a chance and some time (nobody forces anyone to play on launch day). And maybe someone else will finally find a nice MMORPG in Bless,after trying dozens of others, like I did.",True,1527629626,1527630012,True,0,2,0.503115,True

I've played MMOs since EverQuest in 1999... played a lot of alphas, betas, and early access titles over the years....

The devs are passionate it seems, I'll give them that, but given how long this game has been in development (announced in 2011), it's a bit sad how poorly it is optimized, how bad the servers are (after launches in other regions, they should have a handle on it by now), and how convoluted (in some cases unbearably bland) some of the game systems are this far along. It's inexcusable tbh... one example is that it takes ages to open the game because the launcher takes forever to even open it, then you're lucky if you can get past the ""Bless Online"" splash screen to select your server/character. Takes multiple attempts and can sometimes take ~20+ minutes to even get into the game.

Then on top of that, once you do, it takes forever for the game to run smoothly. This is on a system with an i7, 16gb RAM, and a 1070, on average or even below average in game settings. For a game that was announced in 2011 (so likely 10 years in dev), that's inexcusable. I'm sorry. It rarely hits a solid 60fps. Terrain/models load late af. Supposedly there are fixes online, but seriously, you shouldn't have to go and edit config files to get a steady framerate on a game that has been in dev for at least 7 years, if not 10+, that is running on an already outdated engine.

It'd be slightly more forgivable if they didn't remove a lot of the NPCs and assets from their game world during their pre-release press event to make it seem like the game was optimized better. They gave some excuse, saying something like ""oh, ______ just isn't finished yet"". In hind sight, this was a blatant lie to boost sales.

Don't be fooled by the early access title (it isn't, multiple failed launches already. though the community will try to insist it is)... and understand that although some of its core systems are designed like a more western MMO, it still has the underlying Korean grind in some of its mechanics. The gameplay loop is EXTREMELY repetitive, even compared with other MMOs I'd consider repetitive. The gear enhancing grind will involve you running the same handful of instances over and over at endgame for mats to do so, the same two dungeons for gear, and last I checked, there was only one raid on the Korean servers, and the game has been out for quite some time over there now.

The fastest way (more importantly, only way) to progress in this game is via dungeon spamming, which is never good for an MMO's open world (it makes for some PVP hotspots since you have to run to the instance, which is good imo, but still), and the mechanics are mindnumbingly boring and easy when compared to other MMOs. The only thing that makes them somewhat difficult is how enemies and gear scale... you better like running the same dungeon 10-20 times in a row (if not more), even during the leveling process. This is compounded by the fact that you outlevel side quests far too quickly, and their XP / rewards are hardly worth it. The gear variety and its means of acquisition are also insanely bland. Gear also degrades when you repair it. Hope you like those boring ass dungeons. It'd be fine if there was degradation OR enhancing, NOT both.

Good weapons only drop from ""elite"" monsters, so enjoy fighting everyone for a level appropriate weapon, since you don't get credit for tagging like you do in most other games these days, and the spawns are very limited. I can deal with not being guaranteed a drop for my class, and actually prefer it that way if the mob/boss mechanics are remotely interesting... but as I said, they aren't. To boot, you can't even mail gear for other classes to your alts or trade it to friends. When the boss fights are difficult (which happens rarely, most are very easy, I'd imagine this is class dependent), if it can even be called that, they are for the wrong reasons due to how gear scaling works, the mechanics are mindnumbingly easy.


The game is optimized so poorly, I don't even want to imagine GvG, territory control, or their ""100v100"" battles.

For what it's worth, I played on the Korean servers and not much has changed at all. They redid the combat and skill trees a little bit, that's about it. And tbh, I prefer the old system in a lot of ways. The new skill tree system is overly convoluted (build diversity/complexity is good, but not packaged like this), grindy, and not explained very well. The new combat system is a bit more flashy, but feels worse to play, partially because it can be unresponsive (not talking about network lag), the skills and their energy costs / cooldowns just feel bad, the windows of time you have to use some skills can feel too short (kinda good as it adds a level of skill, but when the system is generally unresponsive it feels horrible), charged skills don't trigger properly when you hold down the key. Inability to use certain keybinds and animation locks make moving and comboing far too complicated, and sometimes it's impossible to move out of AOEs, even if you're not animation locked. You'll often find yourself needing a stun or cc immediately, and not have access to it quickly enough, or it'll still be on cooldown due to how fast respawns can sometimes be (it makes some sense for PVP balance). I could go on. It definitely needs work.

I will say that you should keep your eye on this game to see if it eventually becomes something more unique, but in all honesty, there are other games that do everything this one does better. And I'd be very surprised if it reaches its full potential before some of the 'next gen' MMOs release and outshine it.

I cannot honestly recommend the game in the state it is in, as it is inexcusable given how long the game has been in development. Keep your eye on it, that's about all I can recommend, but there are already better MMOs out, and better ones in development.

IF the game reaches its full potential, fixes its optimization issues (the worst I've ever seen, especially for a game in dev this long) and loses some of the Korean-style grind, I'd more readily recommend it.

But sadly, my prediction is that it will remain unoptimized, keep the Korean-style grind systems along with the very repetitive gameplay loop, and likely go p2w by August, and probably be dead by Q4.

I've played MMOs for a long time, and I wanted to believe that NeoWiz would deliver us something good because they seem passionate, but I've been down that road before with plenty of MMOs, and it always ends the same way.

If they prove me wrong, then fantastic. But I don't expect that to be the case. This is likely just them trying to regain their losses after failed attempts in other regions, just as I originally expected. It could potentially be amazing in a year or two, but do NOT waste your money right now, unless you're so desperate for a new MMO, you're willing to buy into another 'maybe one day' MMORPG. Personally, I've had enough of those and cheap, p2w KR MMO cash grabs.

The community is delusional in saying that this is better than other games on the market, and that this is ""normal for early access"". Sure, if the game was ACTUALLY new. The thing is, it isn't. Assuming it's been in dev for ~10 years, it's absolutely inexcusable how poorly it runs, how convoluted its systems are, and how  bland other systems are.

A lot of the players are likely going through that phase of ""I've been waiting for this game for so long and it's finally out! I already spent my money, so let me illogically defend it!"" phase. Not to mention the community is generally worse than most other MMOs, with a few exceptions. Think BDO global chat, perhaps not quite as bad yet.

The story and voice acting are decent though, when your character isn't doing a T-Pose during the cutscences anyway.

(For a more detaild version read below)

[b]The Good Stuff:[/b]
-[u]Combat System[/u] is actually smooth and interesting, I had a great time playing and learning my character and it has potential and from what I hear most of the flaws people are talking about is because they are inexperienced and too afraid to try new things out.. as in they are used to other styles of MMO's combat systems and compare it to them, and it works but you have to remember they are testing something new, it wont be for everyone but as it is now its working and its fun to learn and play with and comparing it to other MMO's wont help it it get better it will just scare away people. It rewards people who know their characters instead of just rewarding you for having great gear. its a bit unbalanced but thats something that will be fixed.
-[u]The Developers[/u], most people are blaming them and hating on them but I think they are doing a good job. We been so excited for a ""new"" MMO and I know this was a let down for some people but that doesnt mean its their fault, no game is perfect for everyone so even if you dont like it no need to hate and blame them for whats going on. They are actually working really hard, adressing the problems and listening to the community. You can see that easily if you just check their website or their launcher, all the information is there. they have been working hard to adjust the game for the EU/NA release and after issues they been fast (Most of the times) to either adress them or note it down. it takes time to fix stuff so give them time and if you dont like it whats out yet then dont play the game check it out in a bit when they have adressed and fixed whats wrong.
-[u]Pet System[/u] its actually really fun, nothing you should dive into at the start of the game. Its meant to be a ""side buff project"" you can do when you wanna try do different stuff. Try get some mounts or pets, farm skills and yes its RNG and many hate that but I find it good both for the market and also for the replayability, people want it easy these days and I dont think that fits in a MMO. You should work for stuff, play the time needed and when you get the loot/pefect pet or whatever youre looking for then that reward should make you happy.
-[u]P2W?[/u] no it's not. Its rewarding you for playing the game, yes you can use money to get skins and premium but premium isnt as bad as people think, if they play the game they will understand. By playing the game you can convert your PVE and PVP tokens to the ""P2W"" currency tho its limited to 50 per day but that just makes so by playing in some time then you can get the skin you want or that extra like of inventory slots (You get some from quests too so its not that bad). I have seen no P2W aspects so far atleast, who knows what the will happen in the future but so far so good.

[b]The Bad Stuff:[/b]
(Most of the stuff here is what the norm is talking about, and I will briefly explain the problem and situation.)
-[u]Poor translation[/u]. Yes, the game have some weird and bad translation problems now and then but it doesnt effect the gameplay that much, you can put 1 and 1 together to understand what they mean. I find it kinda funny when a skill says ""increase cooldown cooldown"" but we know what it actually does. Translation is not a main priority for the game so I believe it will be fixed in the future.
-[u]Poor Censoring[/u], its kinda annoying but I see it as the translation. Its not a main priority. So **ain, this probably will be adressed later on.
-[u]Launch[/u] was not as bad as people make it sound like. Servers had some problems but they tried to fix it with a responce by adding 
more servers and limiting the trafics to the overpopulated servers to spread out the player base so it would be less ""laggy"".
many say its ""The Worse Launch ever"" but thats not even close to it. It was doable and when you got away from the crowd it was fine. 
-[u]Poor optimization[/u]. The game runs solid on 62 fps when you normally play the game, going to over crowded places or something like that. If someone says ""I have I7 8800k and GTX 1080"" then they dont really understand what the problem is. Its not their components, its the settings because its hard capped in settings that arent using the components to their full potential and some of the settings are lowered so they can expand and improve it as they move forward. I agree tho that it should have been looked into and they should have worked harder to push the ""quality"" for the release. 
Theres guides to fix this problem to so IF you have problems they can be fixed to some degree.
-[u]The Players[/u], most players now are mostly crying and begin negative in the chat, instead of actually giving the game feedback. Half of the community is saying ""IT will get better, its early access"" and some people are saying ""it wont get better and you cant blame early access"", here's my view on it. IT will get better as long as we give them a chance, feedback and our thoughts about the game. the game IS in early access and that means stuff will change, improve and they have shown that they are willing to do that and listen to us. I feel like even if youre not happy about how it turned out. be atleast a good person and give the developers feedback instead of hating, harassing and scaring away other people by oversaturating what really happened.


If you dont agree with me feel then free to leave a comment or feel free to add me if theres more information you wanna know or if theres something i've missed, if you agree with me then shead some light on my review so other people can see what the game is really about, so they dont get scared because of the hiccups it had at launch that triggered some people off.

First of all, the game has some issues for a lot of players. Name an MMO that had a glorious launch on their first 26 hrs?
I thought so, none. Bless Online is a fun not P2W game to play. It has a  a very engaging Lore/Storyline. I run the game at 60fps constantly with no problems at 4k resolution. Sometimes it drops to 50 until it loads everything on the city, then back to 60 fps.

The battle system could use a bit more tweaking as the action combat mode is only available for Berserker. They are currently working on the others for a future update. Most of this negative reviews are from players that barely had 10 mins in game and spent more than an hr trying to go past the Bless screen bug. Instead of giving the devs time to fix the Issues they jump on the troll bandwagon.

I've been disconected multiple times, got stuck on loading screen and was unable to progress some quest due to lag.
Would I recommend Bless Online? Absolutely! Its been only 26 hrs of founders access and they are doing their best on stabilizing the game for the players. Honestly I would say give it a week for the game take off if your still on the fence about buying it. I chose to not Refund and have faith on a company that is doing their best to publish the game they so hardly worked for, because they love their creation. If not they would not be releasing this for a fourth time as a Global release.

Most of the negative comments are probably from spoiled impatient teenagers so I wouldn't pay much attention to them. Like most games and early accesses the game isn't yet ready for a public release which is why it's not considered as a release as of now. Most people who bought the pre-launch packs didn't actually ready the conditions and just expect everything to be perfect at launch.

When you consider the fact that the devs and mods have been listening to the  community I'd say this game is pretty good and has a bright future. It's not in every game that the devs actually listen to the customers and so this is a big yes to me. 

Overall the game to me is good, and besides the lag which let's be frank here, happened in every single MMO a few days after launch, there's nothing that I noticed was wrong with the game. My actual config makes the game run smoothly (Yes I work and can pay to myself a normal rig this is no child review) and the game has been quite enjoyable since. That said I've only been able to play 5 or 6 hours. I would have played more but the lag made it impossible.

Overall the game is worth it in comparison to its competition as it's a nice new touch to the genre.

If anything, playing this game has shown me just how sad the MMO gaming community has become. People unable to think their way out of a paper bag:
- People literally unable to finish the tutorial because it requires you to pres three (3) buttons.
-People spamming chat with ""How do I get my mount more stamina""
-People spamming chat with ""How so I tame pets""
-People spamming chat with ""How do I fast travel?""

ALL of these things are explained to you within the first 20 minutes of questing.......do the quest, play the game, and learn it.

People complaing that you can't teleport and have to walk everywhere....

People complaining about CD's being too long.

The MMO community today just wants button mashing hyper speed combat that requires little to no thinking and relies primarily on having better gear.

If you're looking for an older feel to an MMO where you have to walk everywhere, your griffon mounts actually require you to sit on the griffon for 20 minutes to get from point to point. And combat relies more on CD management and positioning than twitch button mashing reflex, then this is a solid choice.

As for the performance issues, I am almost certain these are just trolls bandwagoning on other trolls. I have a 1060 and get a constant 50+ FPS with 20+ in town. People in chat claiming they have dual 1080ti's and cant get over 15 FPS need to get a refund on their 3rd party cards....because they don't work.

Also, this game is about PvP...which means it's about the faction war in the end game. Yes there are dungeons that link into the story line, but they are pretty simple dungeons.....

Don't know what the end game dungeons and raids will be like...I do indeed hope they get harder though.

I'd give it a solid 7/10 right now for what it is. It's nothing revelutionary....but then again, it never claimed to be. It's an old school experience that does what its trying to do well. 

There are server issues, but that's pretty much every launch nowadays. Once performance issues pan out I'd say its a good 7.5/10, maybe even an 8/10 once all the other classes come into play.

Besides, any time someone try's something new and revolutionary (Star Citizen), everyone just goes crazy and yells about how its a scam and cant be done. 

Really, it's just the community. These teenagers nowadays lack any form of critical thinking and then wonder why they are all dropping out of college or cant make it into graduate programs. Just go be a youtube star....that 800 bucks a year will cover your needs until you make....keep trying....hopefully you starve out sooner or later and your absence from the gene pool can hel progress the species.",True,1527629067,1527629284,True,0,0,0.000000,True

The launch of this game was rough. Just like every other MMO launch. They planned on having 1 server for both regions and realized right away how wrong that was. I was one of the first 1000 players on the NA server and I made it through the first 2 hours or so before I was DC'd and then maintenance. Everyone is freaking out because they're inconvienced due to downtime on day one when there was never a formal stress test on their servers. We who got the EA are the people who are stress testing and helping them optomized their servers for the official release. So by no means should any of you expect the servers to be 100% day 1. 

Now day 2 is going very well. There has only been one server crash today NA and one emergency maintence for an hour. 
Overall my FPS is up from yesterday. I've had one DC total today and my game play has been very smooth. It's a very beautiful and breath taking world to explore.
