# SteamReviews
The aim of this project is to leverage the free text in the thousands of reviews of a single product on Steam to get a better understanding of customer opinions (both positive and negative) of a product.

Current customer-facing information is a simple % who recommends a product and a select few review texts as voted upon by users for helpfulness. 

The final output of this project is a pair of Ngram wordclouds, which highlight the differences between the positive and negative reviews of products.
